'''Gholdengo''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''サーフゴー''' ''Surfugo'') is a dual-type {{2t|Steel|Ghost}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation IX]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Gimmighoul}} when [[level]]ed up while the player has 999 [[Gimmighoul Coin]]s. Upon the Evolution, the Gimmighoul Coins are consumed. Gimmighoul's Evolution cannot be canceled with the B button.

Gholdengo is a bipedal humanoid {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} whose body is composed of 1,000 [[Gimmighoul Coin]]s stacked together, giving it a golden, cylindrical appearance. Its face has oval eyes and a mouth displaying a crooked smile. Its body has skinny arms with large hands and short, stumpy legs with no toes. It has three fingers on each hand and four tufts of dreadlock-like "hair", all made out of coins. It wears the strap from a {{p|Gimmighoul}}'s chest as a belt, using it to fasten the chest to its side. The belt buckle has a stylized number 1,000 on it. Gholdengo is capable of creating a golden surfboard out of coins as a means of movement.

Gholdengo is a sociable Pokémon, able to quickly befriend anybody. It overwhelms opponents by firing coins at them in quick succession. The coins that form its body are tightly packed, making it able to withstand damage. When attacked by enemies, it can let loose some of the coins on the areas of its body that are hit, in order to absorb the impact.<ref>[https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon/gholdengo/ Gholdengo — Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet | Official Website]</ref>

Gholdengo is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Make It Rain}}. It is also the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Good as Gold}} as an [[Ability]].

==Trivia==
[[File:Pokémon 1000th EnCOUNTer.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Gold Counter in One Thousand Pokémon]]
* Despite its Japanese name and ability to create a surfboard out of coins, Gholdengo is incapable of learning the move {{m|Surf}}.
* Gholdengo is heavily associated with the number 1,000.
** Its [[List of Pokémon by National Pokédex number|National Pokédex number]] is #1000.
*** The video [[Pokémon 1008 ENCOUNTERS]] was made to commemorate the number of Pokémon surpassing 1,000. It features a counter that increases as Pokémon appear, eventually turning gold when it reaches 1,000 with Gholdengo. In most English markets, it was titled “One Thousand Pokémon!”
** Its belt buckle has a stylized depiction of the number 1,000 on it. As Gholdengo's belt is fashioned from Chest Form Gimmighoul's chest, this symbol is also present on Chest Form Gimmighoul, albeit oriented sideways.
** Its body is made of 1,000 [[Gimmighoul Coin]]s.

===Origin===
Gholdengo's golden humanoid appearance, together with its position as the 1,000th Pokémon in the National Pokédex, may allude to award statuettes, which are often made with gold and given to honor achievements or milestones. Gholdengo also seems to take inspiration from {{wp|surfing|surfers}}, given the golden surfboard it rides on as well as its dreadlock-like appendages and friendly nature, befitting of the archetypal "surfer dude". The recurring cylindrical shape on its body is similar to {{wp|coin wrapper}}s. Its surfboard is similar to {{wp|Koban (coin)|koban}} and {{wp|ōban}}.

Gholdengo is also likely based on gold or {{wp|tumbaga}} artifacts crafted by some pre-Columbian cultures of Central and South America, mainly from the modern-day {{wp|Pre-Columbian cultures of Colombia#Main cultures|Colombia}}. Some of the most notable examples are {{wp|Quimbaya artifacts}} and {{wp|tunjo}}s. These artifacts were commonly utilized as offerings in religious or funerary rituals, which may have inspired Gholdengo's {{t|Ghost}} type.

Additionally, Gholdengo may draw inspiration from {{wp|El Dorado}}, a legend described by Spanish {{wp|conquistador}}s about a lost city of gold, originally a king whose body was covered in gold. The legend is believed to have stemmed from a ceremony done by the {{wp|Muisca}} people, in which their ruler was initiated by having him covered in gold dust and floated into a lake on a {{wp|Muisca raft|raft}} to make offerings — the raft is likely referenced by Gholdengo's surfboard-like platform.

The association of a ghost with coins may draw inspiration from {{wp|Charon's obol}}, where the deceased are buried with coins as a preparation for the afterlife. The coins were frequently placed in the mouth or on the eyes. 

====Name origin====
Gholdengo may be a combination of ''ghoul'' or ''ghost'', ''golden'', and possibly ''go'' (as in {{g|GO}}, the game {{p|Gimmighoul}} debuted in). It may also come from ''tengo'' (Spanish for "I have") or ''деньги'' ''den'gi'' (Russian for money, itself from ''{{wp|denga}}'', a historical unit worth 1/200th of a {{wp|Russian ruble}}).

Surfugo may be a combination of ''surf'', {{j|富豪}} ''fugō'' (wealthy person), ''gold'', and possibly ''go'' (as in Pokémon GO).
