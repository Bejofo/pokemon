'''Floette''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''フラエッテ''' ''Floette'') is a {{type|Fairy}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation VI]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Flabébé}} starting at [[level]] 19 and evolves into {{p|Florges}} when exposed to a [[Shiny Stone]]. Floette also has five separate [[#Form data|forms]], each named for the color of its flower: '''Red Flower''', '''Yellow Flower''', '''Orange Flower''', '''Blue Flower''', and '''White Flower'''. Additionally, it has a currently unobtainable sixth form called '''{{DL|Pokémon X and Y beta|Eternal Flower Floette}}'''.

==Biology==
[[File:Floette Forms TCG.png|thumb|200px|left|Floette's forms as seen in the [[Floette (Flashfire 65)|TCG]]]]
Floette is a small {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a white upper body and a deep-green lower body. Its eyes are black with a green, leaf-like extension over each similar to eyelashes. It has long, notched ears with a yellow ring around each base. Its tail is spade-shaped, and it has thin arms with mitten-like hands. It has two thin black lines on its head. It is a female-only species with no male counterpart.

Floette also holds a flower with five rounded petals that can be red, yellow, orange, blue, or white. The flower has three yellow {{wp|Gynoecium|stamens}} and a long green stem with a single leaf. The color of the flower it uses remains the same, even after evolving.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160403204716/http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/pokemon/other_pokemon/#Floette Floette] (archived)</ref> The more gorgeous the flower, the more power that it contains for Floette to use. Floette is unable to use moves by itself, but when it synchronizes with flowers, it becomes able to use {{type|Grass}} [[move]]s, with White Flower Floette being capable of easily synchronizing with flowers of other colors. Floette can restore withered flowers to perfect health by drawing forth what power is left in them. It can also draw forth the latent capabilities of Grass types. It flutters around and cares for withered flowers by giving its own power to them. If the flowers of a well-tended flower bed bloom, Floette celebrates with an elegant dance. However, it will never forgive anyone who tramples a flowerbed and will attack them mercilessly.

Prior to [[Generation VII]], Floette and its evolutionary relatives were the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that could have {{a|Flower Veil}} and {{a|Symbiosis}} as {{Abilities}}.

===Forms===
Floette has five main forms: Red Flower, Yellow Flower, Orange Flower, Blue Flower, and White Flower.

;Eternal Flower Floette
[[File:AZ's Floette Resurrected.png|250px|thumb|[[AZ]]'s Floette being resurrected]]
Floette also has a sixth form called {{DL|Pokémon X and Y beta|Eternal Flower Floette}}.

The Eternal Flower Floette, the Floette who befriended [[AZ]], is different from a normal Floette. Her tail and eyebrows are blue and the rings around her ears are red. Her flower is different as well and no longer blooms anywhere. She has six petals instead of five: three that are big and three that are smaller. The stem is red and leafless, and the stigma is black and conical. The flower's underside is black and the top of the three big petals are patterned red and black. 

This flower contains terrifying energy, but despite this, Floette still swings the flower around innocently. The flower Floette holds no longer exists in the present day, even though one similar to it can be found in [[Sootopolis City]]. 3,000 years ago, this Floette was resurrected by AZ using a [[Ultimate weapon|machine]] powered by [[Infinity Energy]]. The power of the machine also granted the Floette eternal life, allowing her to still be alive in the present day.

The Eternal Flower Floette is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Light of Ruin}}, though the move currently cannot be used legitimately in the {{pkmn|games}} due to the Pokémon being unobtainable.

===Evolution===
Floette evolves from {{p|Flabébé}} and evolves into {{p|Florges}}.

{{spoilers}}
* '''[[Pokémon X and Y]]''': [[AZ#Befriended|'''Eternal Flower Floette''']] is a major character in the games. 3,000 years ago, [[AZ]]'s Floette died during the great war in [[Kalos]]. Overcome with grief, AZ created a [[Ultimate weapon|machine]] that resurrected Floette and made both of them immortal. Upon learning that AZ had sacrificed the lives of many other Pokémon to revive her, she left him, leaving her old friend to search for her for thousands of years. 3,000 years later, after AZ is finally able to let go of his sorrow after battling the {{Player}}, Floette finally returns to him, resulting in a tearful reunion.

===Form data===
Floette has five separate forms, each with one of five different flower colors: red, yellow, orange, blue, and white. The flower color is maintained through [[Evolution]] from {{p|Flabébé}} and into {{p|Florges}}, and cannot be changed.

In {{g|X and Y}}, Orange and White Flower Floette can only be obtained by evolving Flabébé. Flabébé appear in the {{pkmn2|wild}} in {{DL|Tall grass|flowers}}, with the colors of Flabébé's flower available depending on the flower patch (although each flower patch has multiple Flabébé flower colors). 

In {{g|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon}}, Yellow Flower Floette can be obtained by evolving Flabébé. Yellow Flower Flabébé appear in the wild in [[Melemele Meadow]], with Orange and White Flower Flabébé appearing when called as allies in an [[SOS Battle]]. Red Flower Floette appear in [[Ula'ula Meadow]], Orange and White Flower Floette appear when called as allies in an SOS Battle, and Blue Flower Floette appear in [[Poni Meadow]] and do not call for help.

In [[Generation VI]], as only Red, Yellow, and Blue Flower Floette can be caught in the [[Friend Safari]], it is impossible to obtain a White or Orange Flower Flabébé, Floette, or Florges with the [[Hidden Ability]] {{a|Symbiosis}}. In [[Generation VII]], all forms of the Flabébé evolutionary line can have their Hidden Ability, though the Blue Flower forms cannot be caught with it and must be [[transfer]]red with it from a prior game in order to have it.

In {{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}}, only Red Flower Floette is available.

;Eternal Flower Floette
{{spoilers}}
Eternal Flower Floette is a unique Floette that [[AZ]] befriended 3,000 years ago, appearing in the story of {{g|X and Y}} and {{g|Legends: Z-A}}. The flower she wields has a different design than normal, resembling the structure of the ancient [[ultimate weapon]] constructed by AZ; the form also has a blue, red, and white color scheme instead of green, yellow, and white.

The [[Generation VI]] and {{gen|VII}} games include unused data for this Floette as a usable form, but she is unobtainable. Unlike the other forms, she cannot [[Evolution|evolve]] or [[Pokémon breeding|breed]], does not have the [[Hidden Ability]] {{a|Symbiosis}}, and can learn the otherwise unused move {{m|Light of Ruin}} at [[level]] 50, being the [[Signature move|only Pokémon able to do so]]. Additionally, all of her [[base stats]] are greater than those of a regular Floette.

===Pokémon Generations===
[[File:AZ Floette PG.png|thumb|250px|Eternal Flower Floette in [[Pokémon Generations]]]]
[[AZ]]'s Floette appeared in ''[[PG18|The Redemption]]''. She was initially seen in a flashback of the great war of Kalos, being sent into battle and eventually dying, leading AZ to create the [[ultimate weapon]] with which to revive her. It worked, but after using the weapon to destroy both sides of the army and bring the war to an end, Floette realized how many lives were taken for hers, and left him. She finally returned to him after AZ's battle with {{ga|Calem}} in [[Lumiose City]].

==Trivia==
* In the [[Battle Chateau]], {{tc|Baroness}} Francine's Flabébé uses Floette's [[cry]].
* Floette is the [[List of Pokémon with unique base stat totals|only Pokémon]] with a base stat total of 371.
<!--Eternal Flower Floette is unobtainable, therefore its BST of 551 shouldn't be acknowledged.-->
* Excluding [[Mega Evolution]]s, Floette and its evolutionary relatives are the only {{type|Fairy}} Pokémon introduced prior to [[Generation VIII]] that cannot be obtained in any Generation VIII game.
* Despite being unobtainable in the games, Eternal Flower Floette appears on the cover of [[Pokémon Omega Ruby & Pokémon Alpha Sapphire: The Official National Pokédex]].
* Despite being present in the data in all Generation VI and VII games, as well as {{g|HOME}}, the form name "Eternal Flower" was not officially revealed until [[Pokémon Day#2025|Pokémon Day 2025]], 4,156 days after the release of Pokémon X and Y.<ref>[https://x.com/Pokemon/status/1895129369539969220 Post by the official Pokémon account on X], "Eternal Flower Floette is said to have lived for 3,000 years."</ref>

===Origin===
Floette appears to be based on {{wp|fairy|fairies}} and {{wp|nymph}}s, such as {{wp|Chloris (nymph)|Chloris}} and {{wp|Antheia}}, and how fairies are sometimes depicted flying by holding on to the stems of plants. Its flower is held like a {{wp|parasol}}.

The flower of Eternal Flower Floette resembles a {{wp|Lilium|lily}} or a {{wp|Trillium}}, especially the {{wp|Trillium erectum|red trillium}}. Because of her connection to death and resurrection in the story of [[Pokémon X and Y]], she may also be inspired by the {{wp|Lycoris radiata|red spider lily}}, also known as resurrection lily, which, particularly in Japanese culture, symbolizes death. Eternal Flower Floette's blue, red, and white body matches the colors of the {{wp|Flag of France|French tricolor}}.

====Name origin====
Floette may be a combination of ''flower'' and ''floret'', as well as the French {{wp|diminutive}} suffix ''-ette''.
