'''Shaymin''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''シェイミ''' ''Shaymin'') is a {{type|Grass}} [[Mythical Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation IV]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from another Pokémon, Shaymin has a [[#Form data|second form]] activated by using a [[Gracidea|Gracidea flower]] in the [[time|daytime]]. Its original form, '''Land Forme''', will then become the {{2t|Grass|Flying}}-type '''Sky Forme'''. Shaymin's Sky Forme will revert into and remain in its Land Forme during the night or when {{status|frozen}}. Other circumstances may also cause it to revert<!--Please do not expand here-->.

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Form data|Game data&rarr;Form data]] for these details.)

Shaymin was officially revealed in February 2008, when it was listed as a star of ''[[M11|Giratina and the Sky Warrior]]''. In early June of the same year, its Sky Forme was revealed.

==Biology==
[[File:Shaymin M11 flowers.png|thumb|left|250px|Land Forme Shaymin's extra petals]]
Shaymin is a small, white, {{wp|hedgehog}}-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. In Land Forme, it has green grass-like fur on its back and a pink flower with two leaves on each side of its head, which resembles the [[Gracidea]] flower. More flowers appear on its back whenever it feels comfortable, but when it senses danger, it rapidly hides them again. Its legs are short and its underside is plump. Shaymin is one of the [[List of Pokémon by height|shortest]] {{type|Grass}} Pokémon.

[[File:Shaymin Land Forme toxic petals.png|thumb|250px|Land Forme Shaymin's petals after absorbing toxins]]
Shaymin can instantly purify any polluted area of all impurities in the air and transform it into a lush field of flowers. It takes in the polluted air, purifies it inside its body, breaks it down into water and light, and releases the purified substance in a violent, explosive burst. Its power varies based on the type of pollution absorbed. Shaymin can also communicate with telepathy and sense the gratitude of others.

Each season, Shaymin gathers with others in a flower field somewhere and migrates from there. This behavior is called Flower Carrying, because a new field of flowers grow wherever it lands. Shaymin is also attracted to areas where there is a lot of gratitude. Land Forme Shaymin has a shy personality and is easily scared. It also exhibits the behavior of scratching itself with its hind leg. Shaymin lives in fields of flowers. Since it camouflages by curling itself up, it can easily escape people's notice. It has been observed to like sweet food.

Shaymin is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Seed Flare}}.

===Forms===
[[File:Shaymin Sky Forme toxic petals.png|thumb|250px|Sky Forme Shaymin's petals after absorbing toxins]]
Shaymin has two forms it can change between: Land Forme and Sky Forme.

In Sky Forme, it has a slender, canine-like appearance. The fur on its back becomes a mohawk, and it has a red flower petal on the left side of its neck, resembling a scarf or cape. It has flat, white ears resembling wings, a small tuft of fur on the front of its neck, and a stumpy tail.

The blooming of [[Gracidea|Gracidea flowers]] confers the power of flight upon Shaymin, transforming it into its Sky Forme. It reverts to Land Forme at night or if it is {{status|Freeze|frozen}}. Sky Forme Shaymin has a courageous, energetic, and playful personality. It spreads feelings of gratitude when it takes flight. Sky Forme Shaymin has a deeper voice than Land Forme.

===NPC appearances===
* {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky}}: A tribe of Shaymin have made their [[Shaymin Village|home]] at near the trail leading to the top of the nearby [[Sky Peak]] mountain. An accompanying Shaymin demonstrates its ability to instantly purify polluted environments, its use of the [[Gracidea]] to transform into its {{form|Shaymin|Sky Forme}}, and can be recruited into the player's party after clearing the dungeon for a second time.

===Form data===
Shaymin has two forms it can change between: Land Forme, introduced in {{game|Diamond and Pearl|s}}, and Sky Forme, introduced in {{game|Platinum}}.

Normally, Shaymin is in its Land Forme, which is {{type|Grass}} and resembles a hedgehog. When exposed to a [[Gracidea]], Shaymin transforms into its Sky Forme, which is {{2t|Grass|Flying}}-type and white in color.
[[File:Shaymin Forme Selection Super Mystery Dungeon.png|right|frameless|278x278px]]
Sky Forme Shaymin will revert into and remain in its Land Forme at night or if it is {{status|frozen}}; Shaymin also changes back to Land Forme when deposited in the [[PC]] (prior to [[Generation VII]]), when withdrawn from the PC (Generation VII onward), when deposited in {{g|Bank}} (but not {{g|HOME}}), or when deposited in the [[Pokémon Day Care]] or [[Pokémon Nursery]]. If a frozen Shaymin in Sky Forme is holding a [[Lum Berry]] or an [[Aspear Berry]], it will eat the Berry after transforming back to Land Forme. In {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, Sky Forme Shaymin will also revert to Land Forme when exposed to a Gracidea again, and will not revert into its Land Forme at night unless it enters a {{pkmn|battle}} during the night. {{status|Frostbite}} will also cause it to revert to Land Forme. In {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, Sky Forme Shaymin will not revert into its Land Forme at night until after a battle.

In [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky]], Shaymin becomes Sky Forme temporarily when the Gracidea item is used. The Gracidea can be obtained for free daily from a Shaymin in the [[Shaymin Village]]. In [[Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon|Super Mystery Dungeon]], Shaymin's Forme can be selected manually before entering a dungeon. In Explorers of Sky, Sky Forme Shaymin has boosted action speed. In Super Mystery Dungeon, Sky Forme merely affects its type.

The two forms have different [[base stats]], {{Abilities}}, [[type]]s, [[move]]s they can learn, and [[cry|cries]].

In [[Generation IV]], Sky Forme Shaymin's cry cannot be played in the [[Pokédex]], due to it only registering the first form encountered. As wild or traded Shaymin will be in Land Forme and Pokémon aren't registered in link battles, it is impossible to register a Sky Forme Shaymin. The only cry used for Shaymin in {{g|Ranger: Guardian Signs}} is the one of its Land Forme.

[[File:Shaymin Sky anime.png|thumb|250px|Sky Forme Shaymin in {{aniseries|DP}}]]
===Major appearances===
====[[Shaymin (M11)]]====
Shaymin debuted in ''[[M11|Giratina and the Sky Warrior]]'', where it was fleeing from {{mov|Giratina}}. It thought that Giratina wanted to eat it, but in reality, the Renegade Pokémon wanted to use Shaymin's {{m|Seed Flare}} to open a portal from the [[Reverse World]] to the [[Pokémon world|real world]]. It appeared in both of its Formes in the {{pkmn|movie}}. This Shaymin had the ability to {{pkmn2|Talking|talk}} via telepathy.

====[[Mallow's Shaymin]]====
In ''[[SM108|Memories in the Mist!]]'', a Shaymin encountered {{an|Mallow}} after being drawn to her strong feelings of gratitude towards [[Mallow's mother|her late mother]]. Mallow took care of it until ''[[SM146|Thank You, Alola! The Journey Continues!]]'', where Shaymin was exposed to some Gracideas, transforming into its Sky Forme, and then flew away. This Shaymin was unique in that, in its Sky Forme, its eyes resembled the eyes of Mallow's mother, instead of those of a regular Shaymin.

====Other====
Shaymin made its regular animated series debut in ''[[DP168|Keeping In Top Forme!]]'', where [[Marley]] was protecting it from {{TRT}}. She, along with {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}}, then spent the majority of the episode trying to take Shaymin to a flower field so it could reunite with its friends.

===Minor appearances===
A Shaymin appeared in its Land Forme during the ending credits in ''[[PK24|Meloetta's Moonlight Serenade]]''.

Three Shaymin appeared in their Sky Formes in ''[[SM146|Thank You, Alola! The Journey Continues!]]'', where they greeted the Shaymin Mallow had been taking care of and accompanied it during its departure.

[[File:Shaymin 3DS trophy SSB4.png|thumb|150px|Shaymin trophy in Super Smash Bros. for 3DS]]
Shaymin also appears in both Formes as a single trophy in the 3DS version of the game.

====Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''When in its Land Forme, this Pokémon sports a fetching pink flower. In Sky Forme, it can take to the air with ease. This Legendary Pokémon is hard to find, but it can sense anyone with a grateful heart. This ability is where the name "Gratitude Pokémon" comes from.''

'''PAL''': ''No wonder this Mythical Pokémon is so hard to find! In its Land Forme, it looks just like a flowery patch of grass. Good luck spotting that in a field! Shaymin has two different forms, though, and in Sky Forme, it can fly. In both forms, Shaymin reacts to gratitude, hence its nickname: the Gratitude Pokémon.'

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Shaymin appears as {{sbw|Spirits}} in its Land Forme and Sky Forme.
{{-}}

==Trivia==
* Despite being a [[Mythical Pokémon]], ''[[Pokémon Diamond & Pokémon Pearl: Super Music Collection|Battle! (Wild Pokémon)]]'' plays while battling it in Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, {{v2|Platinum}}, {{pkmn|Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl|Brilliant Diamond, and Shining Pearl}}.
* Shaymin Sky Forme is the only {{type|Flying}} Mythical Pokémon, excluding {{p|Arceus}} while holding a [[Sky Plate]].
* From [[Generation IV]] to {{gen|VI}}, it is impossible to use Shaymin's Sky Forme in the [[Battle Spot]] or in online competitions that allow Mythical Pokémon. This is because only Pokémon stored in the [[PC]] can be used and Shaymin would revert to Land Forme as soon as deposited. In [[Generation VII]], this was changed so that Sky Forme can be deposited into the PC and only revert to Land Forme when withdrawn.
* Due to a [[glitch]] in {{g|Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl}}, it was possible to reach [[Flower Paradise]] and catch Shaymin without [[Oak's Letter]]. This was patched in version 1.1.2.
** This glitch was the only method of obtaining a shiny Shaymin without the event, as the Shaymin in {{g|Legends: Arceus}} is Shiny-locked.
* Shaymin requires [[Pokémon Sword and Shield|Pokémon Sword or Shield]] save data to be caught in {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, despite not being available in either of the former.
* Shaymin Sky Forme is the only Pokémon introduced in {{game|Platinum}} that the player can legitimately own multiple of in [[Generation IV]].
* In {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}}, there is a unique animation for Shaymin transforming into its Land Forme if it is [[Walking Pokémon|walking with the player]] when the [[time]] changes to night.
* Shaymin is the most recently introduced Mythical Pokémon to belong to the Medium-Slow [[Experience|Experience Group]]. All Mythical Pokémon released since have belonged to the Slow Experience Group. 

===Origin===
Shaymin's Land Forme is based on a {{wp|hedgehog}}. However, its white body and the grass-like fur on its back make it somewhat resemble a {{wp|Chia Pet}} as well. It may also be inspired by flower meadows or flower gardens. Moreover, when Land Forme Shaymin blooms with flowers, as seen in the {{pkmn|movie}} ''[[M11|Giratina and the Sky Warrior]]'', Shaymin appears as a bouquet of flowers, which are commonly given as a sign of thankfulness, emphasizing Shaymin's role as the Gratitude Pokémon. The flower on its body resembles a [[Gracidea]] and could be based on a {{wp|hydrangea}}, particularly the {{wp|Hydrangea macrophylla|bigleaf hydrangea}}. It also shares, together with the leaves on its Sky Forme's neck, similarities with a {{wp|poinsettia}}, a popular Christmas flower.

Shaymin's Sky Forme has a few aspects, like antlers, that resemble {{wp|reindeer}} and the ability to fly could be based on {{wp|Santa Claus's reindeer}}, but its sprightly behavior, an affinity for flowers, and the ability to fly bring to mind {{wp|angel}}s and {{wp|fairy|fairies}}. Due to its healing abilities, it could also be based on a {{wp|guardian angel}}. Given the appearance of the flower around its neck resembling the knot of a {{wp|neckerchief}}, the resemblance to the green of its legs to boots or gloves, ability to fly, and more confident attitude seen in {{aniseries|PTS}} and related media, Sky Forme Shaymin may be inspired by superheroes, particularly those in the Japanese sentai genre.

Shaymin's ability to convert toxic gases into fresh air may be a reference to the {{wp|environmentalism|environmentalist}} practice of removing pollution from nature for a healthier ecosystem. It could also be a reference to plants filtering non-breathable {{wp|carbon dioxide}} from the atmosphere into breathable {{wp|oxygen}}, or {{wp|decomposer|decomposer organisms}} converting decaying or waste materials into nutrient-rich soil for future plant growth. Its ability to transform land into a flower field in combination with its Flying-type could also be a reference to {{wp|pollen}} and {{wp|spore}}s in the air or in the wind {{wp|seed dispersal#Wind|floating seeds}}.

====Name origin====
Shaymin is from 謝謝 ''xièxie'' (Chinese for ''thanks'').<ref>[https://lineblog.me/masudajunichi/archives/4073542.html Junichi Masuda's Official Blog on Line] (Japanese)</ref> It may also be derived from 蝟 ''harinezumi'' (hedgehog) and םשמי ''{{wp|Shamayim}}'' (Hebrew for ''heaven'') with the latter correlating directly with Shaymin's Sky Forme.
