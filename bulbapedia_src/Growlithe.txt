'''Growlithe''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ガーディ''' ''Gardie'') is a {{type|Fire}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s into {{p|Arcanine}} when exposed to a [[Fire Stone]].

In [[Hisui]], Growlithe has a dual-type {{2t|Fire|Rock}} [[regional form]]. It evolves into Hisuian Arcanine when exposed to a Fire Stone.

==Biology==
Growlithe is a quadrupedal {{wp|canidae|canine}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. It has orange fur with black stripes along its back and legs. The fur on its muzzle, chest, belly, and tail is beige, as is an additional tuft of fur on top of its head. Growlithe's coat is noticeably longer on its chest and tail. It has gray eyes, a black nose, and large, round and triangular ears with beige interiors. Its forepaws have two visible claws, while its hind paws have three toes each. Each paw has a brown pad.

Growlithe is a friendly and loyal Pokémon that will fearlessly defend its {{pkmn|Trainer}} and territory from harm, even against larger, stronger enemies. In particular, it has been known to fight with {{p|Rockruff}} over territory. It will fiercely bark at, bite, and chase away any perceived threat. Otherwise, this obedient Pokémon will wait motionlessly until given an order. It has a long history with people, as its bones have been found in Stone Age ruins. In the wild, Growlithe can be commonly found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|grassy plains}}.

Growlithe also has a powerful olfactory sense. If it detects an unknown smell in its territory, it roars to flush out the intruder. It can smell the emotions of others, and never forgets a scent. However, strong, unpleasant smells can disable Growlithe's sense of smell for short periods, as seen in the ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' episode ''[[EP054|The Case of the K-9 Caper!]]''. As mentioned in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Growlithe is known to bark at anyone who approaches it while sleeping.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref>

===Forms===
Growlithe has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Hisuian}} Growlithe.

In [[Hisui]], Growlithe's fur is dark orange-red, while its mane and tail are light gray, and its muzzle is a light tan. The fur is made out of igneous rock components. Its mane covers its eyes and extends below its head, ending with three curls. Its ears are round and square with light orange-red interiors. It has a small horn made of rock on its head, and its tail is curly.

Growlithe's Hisuian form is the result of it being exposed to volcanic activity within the coastal highlands it lives in during Hisui's early times. Hisuian Growlithe's soft and insulated fur allows it to survive the cold weather of Hisui. Although Hisuian Growlithe's horn is made of rock, it is fragile and breaks easily, so the Pokémon rarely uses its horn unless needed. Hisuian Growlithe live in pairs, and are known to be vigilant when guarding their territory. Hisuian Growlithe take much longer to bond with humans because they have lived apart from humans for a long time.<ref>[https://legends.arceus.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon/growlithe/ Hisuian Growlithe | Pokémon Legends: Arceus Official Website]</ref>

===Evolution===
Growlithe evolves into {{p|Arcanine}}.

{{rf|Hisuian}} Growlithe evolves into Hisuian Arcanine.

==Trivia==
* The beta {{DL|Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon names}} in {{2v2|Red|Blue}} list Growlithe as ''Flamie''.
* Growlithe can be seen as a parallel to {{p|Vulpix}}. Both are {{cat|Generation I Pokémon}} that evolve once via a [[Fire Stone]]. Growlithe is exclusive to {{game3|Red and Green|Pokémon Red|s}}, {{pkmn|Blue Version (Japanese)|Blue (Japan)}}, {{game3|Gold and Silver|Gold|s}}, {{game3|FireRed and LeafGreen|FireRed|s}}, and {{game3|HeartGold and SoulSilver|HeartGold|s}} while Vulpix is to Green, international Blue, Silver, LeafGreen, and SoulSilver. Growlithe has a 75% chance of being male while Vulpix has a 75% of being female, they are both in the {{egg3|Field}}, can have the Ability {{a|Flash Fire}}, and are yellow when {{Shiny}} from [[Generation III]] on. Furthermore, both are based primarily on canine-like creatures of Japanese folklore: Growlithe on the ''{{wp|shisa}}'', Vulpix on the ''{{wp|kitsune}}''.
* Growlithe shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Lillipup}}, {{p|Rockruff}}, {{p|Yamper}}, and {{p|Fidough}}. They are all known as the Puppy Pokémon.
** {{rf|Hisuian}} Growlithe shares its category with {{p|Sentret}} and {{p|Patrat}}. They are all known as the Scout Pokémon.
* Growlithe and its evolved form are the only Pokémon with a [[List of Pokémon by gender ratio|male-female ratio of 3:1]] that aren't in the {{egg3|Human-Like}}.
* Through {{DL|List of battle glitches in Generation I|Evolution stone bypassing|a glitch}} in the [[Generation I]] games, Pokémon that would normally require an [[Evolution stone]] to evolve can be evolved without it, provided that the Pokémon levels up in the battle and the player has sent out a specific Pokémon in the same battle. In the case of the [[Thunder Stone]], this Pokémon is Growlithe.
* Hisuian Growlithe and its evolved form were designed by [[Megumi Mizutani]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/megtany/status/1500305951479324673 Tweet by 水谷恵 (@megtany).] Posted on March 6, 2022.</ref>
* In [[Pokémon Legends: Arceus]]'s internal code, Hisuian Growlithe's Hidden Ability is {{a|Justified}} instead of {{a|Rock Head}}.
* Hisuian Growlithe and Hisuian {{p|Braviary}} were the first [[Hisuian form]]s to be officially revealed.

===Origin===
Growlithe may be based on Japanese statues called 獅子 ''{{wp|shisa}}'' that resemble a mix between {{wp|lion}}s and {{wp|dog}}s. They may also originate from Chinese 獅 ''{{wp|Chinese guardian lions|shī}}'' or Japanese 狛犬 ''{{wp|komainu}}'', which are guardian statues that also resemble lion and dog mixes and are sometimes incorrectly called "Foo dogs" in the West. Both ''shisa'' and ''shī'' statues alike are often found in pairs, believed to invite good luck, and used as guardians, which may have inspired Growlithe's protective nature. Its stripes and coloration are reminiscent of {{wp|tiger}}s. It may also draw inspiration from dogs with brindle ("tiger-striped") coat patterns, such as the 甲斐犬 {{wp|Kai Ken}}.

In its Hisuian Form, its {{t|Rock}} typing and appearance may be based on the ''komainu'' statues.

====Name origin====
Growlithe may be a combination of ''growl'' and ''lithe'' (flexible).

Gardie may refer to its abilities as a guard dog, as a corruption of ''guard'' or ''guardian''.
