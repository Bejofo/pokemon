'''Kyurem''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''キュレム''' ''Kyurem'') is a dual-type {{2t|Dragon|Ice}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation V]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Kyurem has two alternate [[#Form data|forms]], which are activated by using the [[DNA Splicers]] on it and either {{p|Reshiram}} or {{p|Zekrom}}, resulting in a process called '''[[Pokémon fusion|Absofusion]]''' (Japanese: '''{{ruby|吸収合体|きゅうしゅうがったい}}''' ''Absorb Union''), which removes Reshiram or Zekrom from the party until the fusion is undone. It will then become '''White Kyurem''' when fused with Reshiram or '''Black Kyurem''' when fused with Zekrom.

(Refer to [[#Form data|Game data&rarr;Form data]] for more details.)

Kyurem, Reshiram, and Zekrom are often collectively referred to as the [[Tao trio]] by fans. The group is referred to in the [[Myths and legends involving Legendary and Mythical Pokémon|myths and legends]] of the [[Unova]] region. In ''[[M15|Kyurem VS. The Sword of Justice]]'', it is also associated with the [[Swords of Justice]].

Kyurem is the [[game mascot]] of both {{B2W2}}, appearing on the boxart of Black 2 as Black Kyurem and White 2 as White Kyurem.

==Biology==
[[File:Kyurem tendrils.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Kyurem's tendril-like appendages beneath its ice wings]]
Kyurem is a gray and blue, bipedal {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} of indefinable but seemingly draconic basis. Kyurem has a blue head and snout and has yellow eyes without pupils, a pair of pointed light bluish horns on its head, and a yellow crest on its skull that is bioluminescent. Three pointed teeth jut out the bottom of either side of its jaws, which are frozen shut by the ice covering its head. Its long, gray neck has lines running around its whole body, legs, arms, and tail. It has two arms, each with two claws, and each arm is joined by its oddly-shaped, blue ice wings. Each wing has two spikes which are bioluminescent. If its wings are broken, gray tendril-like appendages are revealed on Kyurem's back. The right side of its body seems to be damaged in some way, as the wing and horn on its head on that side are shorter; the right side of its head also has a spiked edge near its jaw hinge that is absent from its left. Its legs are somewhat slender and have three sharp ice-like claws on each enormous foot. Its tail has three blue conical spikes on its tip, and appears to be some sort of propulsion device or a container of energy; exactly what it is based on is unclear, but it may be a damaged turbine.

Kyurem generates powerful, freezing energy inside itself, but its body becomes frozen when the energy leaks out. It appears that this Pokémon uses its ice powers to freeze its own body in order to stabilize its cellular structure. It is said to have a power that exceeds that of {{p|Reshiram}} and {{p|Zekrom}}, however, this power is kept at bay by the extreme cold. Kyurem can use its tendril-like appendages to transform Reshiram and Zekrom back into their respective [[Dragon Stones]] and even {{pkmn|fusion|absofuse}} with them while they're in that state. In [[Pokémon Adventures]], similarly to Reshiram and Zekrom, Kyurem is somehow capable of flying even with its frozen wings. According to the [[Village of Dragons]]'s [[Elder (Village of Dragons)|Elder]] in ''[[M15|Kyurem VS. The Sword of Justice]]'', Kyurem is considered one of the strongest {{type|Dragon}} Pokémon in the world. Kyurem is powerful enough to cover [[Opelucid City]] and even the entire [[Unova]] [[region]] in ice. Kyurem loves [[Kyurem Treat]]s made by [[Snacksworth]], who once encountered it in the past.

According to an old legend in [[Lacunosa Town]], Kyurem is an [[extraterrestrial Pokémon]] that crashlanded on the [[Pokémon world|planet]] inside either an icy meteor or a [[Dragon Stone]], creating the [[Giant Chasm]]. This same legend describes Kyurem as hostile towards Pokémon and humans, due to the fact it supposedly devoured them if they were found outside of Lacunosa Town during the night. However, according to another old legend told by [[Drayden]], Kyurem was created by the leftovers of [[List of disputed and unidentified Pokémon#Original Dragon|the single powerful Dragon Pokémon]] owned by the [[Heroes of Truth and Ideals|twin heroes]] of [[Unova]] after it split up into Reshiram and Zekrom. Its true origin is unknown.

Kyurem is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Glaciate}} by leveling up.

===Forms===
Kyurem has two alternate forms: White Kyurem and Black Kyurem.

These forms are formed by [[Pokémon fusion|absofusing]] with {{p|Reshiram}} and {{p|Zekrom}}, respectively, sharing many aspects of their designs with them. It can absofuse with them in their respective [[Dragon Stones]] to change to White or Black Kyurem. The reason for this is due to the sameness of Kyurem, Reshiram, and Zekrom's genes, allowing said fusion. As a result, Kyurem also shares Reshiram or Zekrom's beliefs in truth or ideals, respectively, when fused with either of the two dragons. It's also said to wait for a hero to fill in the missing parts of its body with truth or ideals. In ''Kyurem VS. The Sword of Justice '', Kyurem can also change into Black Kyurem or White Kyurem without fusing by channeling the powers of both Reshiram and Zekrom it has within itself.

;White Kyurem
[[File:646Kyurem-White2.png|thumb|right|175px|White Kyurem in Overdrive mode]]
White Kyurem resembles a hybrid version of itself and Reshiram. When transformed into White Kyurem, its legs are just like the original, but shorter, and the middle toe becomes ice. As White Kyurem, it has some extra icy details on the legs. Its tail resembles that of Reshiram but is attached to the body with three gray parts of the skin. The tail is capable of movement and contains four holes that are located horizontally on either side. White Kyurem's torso is also slimmer, especially when compared to its counterpart, Black Kyurem. Its shoulders are covered in 'squares' of ice with two pins protruding from the back of each, which can come out and 'plug into' the aforementioned holes in its tail. As White Kyurem, it has slender arms with three claws each, and wings located on its forearms; additionally, while the majority of its right arm is frozen, its left arm is bare, revealing two silvery cuffs resembling those of Reshiram. Its neck is the same shape but becomes upright along with the posture of the Pokémon. The ice covering Kyurem's upper jaws has partially disappeared, allowing it to open its mouth. Like Black Kyurem, it now has white eyes with black pupils. During a battle, White Kyurem enters {{form|Reshiram, Zekrom, and Kyurem|Overdrive mode}}, and tubes sprout from its icy shoulders to its tail. In White Kyurem's case, the ends of its hair and wings become red-hot and its tail acquires fiery highlights that extend from the base to the tip.

White Kyurem can use both the power of fire and ice due to fusing with Reshiram. White Kyurem can also fly using its wings and the jet engine-like tail. Due to Reshiram's influence, White Kyurem firmly believes in the pursuit of truth. Due to foreseeing a world of truth, it will fight to protect said future for both humans and Pokémon.

White Kyurem and {{p|Reshiram}} are the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Fusion Flare}}. They're also the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Turboblaze}} as an [[ability]]. White Kyurem is also the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move {{m|Ice Burn}}.

;Black Kyurem
[[File:646Kyurem-Black2.png|thumb|left|175px|Black Kyurem in Overdrive mode]]
Black Kyurem resembles a hybrid version of itself and Zekrom. When transformed into Black Kyurem, its legs are just like the original, but shorter, and the middle toe becomes ice. Its tail resembles that of Zekrom but is attached to the body with three gray parts of the skin. The tail is capable of movement and contains two holes on either side; they are located vertically on Black Kyurem as opposed to White Kyurem. Black Kyurem's torso is noticeably bulkier, and its shoulders are covered in 'squares' of ice with two pins protruding from each, which can come out and 'plug into' the aforementioned holes. As Black Kyurem, it has Zekrom's arms, but they are more muscular and without wings on either hand; its left arm and wing are also frozen over. Its neck is the same shape but becomes upright due to adopting Zekrom's posture. The ice covering Kyurem's lower jaws has partially disappeared, allowing it to move its mouth. Like White Kyurem, it also has white eyes with black pupils. It is also worth noting that Black Kyurem has three sharp teeth on either side of its mouth, while White Kyurem only has two. During a battle, Black Kyurem and White Kyurem enter {{form|Reshiram, Zekrom, and Kyurem|Overdrive mode}}, and tubes sprout from its back to its tail. In Black Kyurem's case, parts of its right arm and the tip of the horn on the back of its head turn blue, while its tail lights up with electricity.

Black Kyurem can use the power of both electricity and ice due to fusing with Zekrom. Black Kyurem can fly using an anti-gravity field through its generator-like tail. Due to Zekrom's influence, Black Kyurem firmly believes in the pursuit of ideals. Due to foreseeing an ideal world, it will fight to protect said future for both humans and Pokémon.

Black Kyurem and {{p|Zekrom}} are the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Fusion Bolt}}. They're also the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Teravolt}} as an [[ability]]. Black Kyurem is also the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move {{m|Freeze Shock}}.

====By [[TM]]====
Starting in [[Generation VIII]], Kyurem can learn {{m|Scary Face}} even if fused. In that case, if Kyurem becomes unfused while knowing Scary Face, it will forget this move before the fusion move ({{m|Fusion Bolt}} or {{m|Fusion Flare}}) is replaced with Scary Face.

===Form data===
Kyurem, in addition to its standard form, has two other forms: White Kyurem and Black Kyurem. They are the [[game mascot]]s of {{B2W2}}, which they were introduced in.

Kyurem changes its form through the use of the [[DNA Splicers]], which fuses it with {{p|Reshiram}} or {{p|Zekrom}}. The combination retains Kyurem's attributes, such as its [[level]], [[Poké Ball]], [[held item]], [[game of origin]], [[personality value]], {{IV}}s, {{EV}}s, [[nickname]], [[original Trainer|OT]], [[Trainer ID number|Trainer ID number, secret ID number]], met location, [[Pokérus]], and so on. This fusion can be reversed by using the DNA Splicers again, with Reshiram or Zekrom remaining unaltered from before being fused, including whatever item it may have been holding. The DNA Splicers can only fuse one Kyurem at a time. White Kyurem and Black Kyurem cannot be deposited into {{g|Bank}} or {{g|HOME}}, nor can they be [[trade]]d or {{pkmn2|released}} without having the fusion undone first.

In {{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}}, if the [[Altar of Ice: Depths]] is cleared, Kyurem will cycle through forms after being used in a dungeon.

White Kyurem has the [[Ability]] {{a|Turboblaze}} and learns the [[move]]s {{m|Fusion Flare}} and {{m|Ice Burn}} by leveling up, and its [[cry]] is a combination of standard Kyurem and Reshiram's cries. Black Kyurem has the Ability {{a|Teravolt}} and learns the moves {{m|Fusion Bolt}} and {{m|Freeze Shock}} by leveling up, and its cry is a combination of standard Kyurem and Zekrom's cries.

When Kyurem becomes fused with or separated from either Reshiram or Zekrom while it knows certain moves, Kyurem's move set will automatically be updated without prompting the player. Fusing Kyurem will replace {{m|Scary Face}} with either Fusion Bolt or Fusion Flare, and replace {{m|Glaciate}} with either Freeze Shock or Ice Burn, if one or both of these moves are present. Reversing the fusion will perform the inverse of these move transformations. Starting in [[Generation VIII]], it is possible for Kyurem to learn Scary Face by [[TM]] after becoming fused; in these games, if Kyurem becomes unfused while it knows both Scary Face and the fusion move, the fusion move will change back to Scary Face and then all but the earliest instance of Scary Face will be deleted from the move set, to prevent having duplicate copies of the same move.

===Main series===
====Major appearances====
=====[[Kyurem (M15)]]=====
Kyurem debuted in all three of its forms in ''[[M15|Kyurem VS. The Sword of Justice]]''. It was challenged by {{OBP|Keldeo|M15}}, who wasn't ready to fight it, but arrogantly claimed that he was a Sword of Justice. After the terrified Keldeo fled during the middle of the fight, Kyurem relentlessly pursued Keldeo in order to finish the battle they had started. Along with the other Legendary Pokémon present in the movie, Kyurem can [[Talking Pokémon|speak through telepathy]].

=====Other=====
Kyurem appeared in all three of its forms in ''[[M18|Hoopa and the Clash of Ages]]'' as one of six [[Legendary Pokémon]] summoned and hypnotized by the shadow {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Hoopa|Hoopa Unbound}} as its reinforcements. It and its teammates engaged in a battle against the {{p|Latios}}, {{p|Latias}}, and {{Shiny}} {{p|Rayquaza}} summoned to protect the real {{an|Hoopa}} in [[Dahara City]]. Eventually, after the shadow Hoopa was sealed in a [[Prison Bottle]], the hypnosis on Kyurem and the other Legendary Pokémon was lifted, and Kyurem departed for its home.

Normal Form Kyurem also appears as a trophy in both games.

====Trophy information====

In battle, it will generate incredibly cold energy and then unleash it using Icy Wind. This move will deal constant damage before freezing opponents. ''

'''PAL''': ''Kyurem is thought to be an empty shell left behind when Reshiram and Zekrom split into two. Its icy energy is so powerful that it can freeze its own body. When Kyurem has built up enough energy, it can unleash Icy Wind, shooting spirals of cold left and right. After damaging fighters, this attack with leave them frozen.''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Kyurem returns as a Pokémon summoned from the {{i|Poké Ball}}, retaining its behavior from the previous game. All three of its forms also appear as {{sbw|Spirits (characters)|Spirits}}.

===Origin===
Kyurem and its two counterparts {{p|Reshiram}} and {{p|Zekrom}} are based on the concept of {{wp|yin and yang}} in {{wp|Taoism}}. Kyurem, however, symbolizes {{wp|Wuji (philosophy)|wuji}}, the absence of yin and yang. In regards to overall design, it appears to be based on a {{wp|Theropoda|theropod}} and a {{wp|European dragon}}, similar to Zekrom. Its arms in particular seem to be influenced by ''{{wp|Tyrannosaurus}}''. Its {{t|Ice}}-typing may allude to the absence of energy and the concept of {{wp|absolute zero}}. Its rock-like body and origin story of arriving on Earth like a meteor are references to comets, which are largely composed of ice crystals.

Given that its Japanese name contains mu, it may be based on the ''{{wp|kōan}}'' {{wp|Mu (negative)|mu}}.

====Name origin====
Kyurem may be derived from 急冷 ''kyūrei'' (rapid cooling), グレイ ''gurei'' (gray), 冷 ''rei'' (cold), 零 ''rei'' (zero), or an anagram of ゆき (雪 ''yuki'', snow), and 無 ''{{wp|Mu (negative)|mu}}'' (nothing). ''Rem'' may also mimic the ''rom'' of {{p|Zekrom}} and the ''ram'' of {{p|Reshiram}}.
