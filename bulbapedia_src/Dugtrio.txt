'''Dugtrio''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ダグトリオ''' ''Dugtrio'') is a {{type|Ground}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s from {{p|Diglett}} starting at [[level]] 26.

In [[Alola]], Dugtrio has a dual-type {{2t|Ground|Steel}} [[regional form]]. It evolves from Alolan Diglett starting at level 26.

It is [[Ecologically similar Pokémon|ecologically similar]] to {{p|Wugtrio}}; however, the two are separate species.

==Biology==
Dugtrio is a set of {{p|Diglett}} triplets sharing a single body, although no one knows what its body looks like since it's perpetually buried underground. Each head is incredibly tough with a smooth surface, and has brown skin, black eyes, and a large, round, pink nose. Dugtrio's three heads think the same thoughts and act cooperatively, though on rare occasions may fight over which head gets to eat first. In order to make burrowing easier, each head will bob up and down to loosen the soil. Dugtrio can tunnel under the earth at 60&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) to a depth of 60 miles (100 kilometers), triggering tremors and earthquakes. It is capable of burrowing endlessly. Dugtrio lives in tunnels and {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Cave Pokémon|caves}} under the earth. Dugtrio is considered important for agriculture as its digging aerates the soil and makes it suitable for farming. As shown in the [[Pikachu short]] ''[[PK04|Pikachu's Rescue Adventure]]'', Dugtrio sometimes lives in hollow trees in forests. It maintains the soil and plants trees to revitalize wooded areas. As mentioned in [[Pokémon Sleep]], the three triplets of Dugtrio is known to sleep together, never separating from each other. The trio's teamwork remains strong even when sleeping.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref>

In [[Generation II]], Dugtrio and its pre-evolved form, {{p|Diglett}}, were the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Fissure}}. 

===Forms===
Dugtrio has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Alolan}} Dugtrio.

[[Alola]]n Dugtrio is visually very similar to its counterpart, except each head has a mop of golden hair formed from modified whiskers. The left head has a bob-cut, the right head has curly "shoulder-length" hair, and the last one has flowing hair that touches the ground behind it. This hair is made out of thin, yet heavy strands of steel, which grows slowly and continuously throughout Alolan Dugtrio's life.<ref name=SMsite>[https://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/alolan-dugtrio/ Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Alolan Dugtrio] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20170925010230/http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com:80/en-us/pokemon/alolan-dugtrio/ archive])</ref> The hairs act as a defensive measure, as well as sensors that can detect vibrations from long distances underground. 

In the [[Alola]] region, Alolan Dugtrio is regarded as a feminine deity of the earth, and taking its hairs is thought to bring bad luck.<ref name=SMsite/> The people of Alola are known to fall to their knees and bow in respect to any Alolan Dugtrio they encounter. In Alola, there is superstitious belief that several Alolan Dugtrio will emerge out of their holes whenever an volcanic eruption occurs. Older residents of Alola will flee instantly upon witnessing this unusal sight. It's believed that Alolan Dugtrio is capable of detecting movements underground that indicate an impending eruption. Due to this, they tend to come aboveground in fright as an warning. They can also be found in the [[Coastal Biome]] of [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]], where Alola's island life is simulated.

Alolan Dugtrio and its pre-Evolution are the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Tangling Hair}} as an [[Ability]].

{{p|Wugtrio}} was once considered a regional variant of Dugtrio due to their resemblance, but it has since been reclassified as a completely separate species.

===Evolution===
Dugtrio evolves from {{p|Diglett}}.

{{rf|Alolan}} Dugtrio evolves from Alolan Diglett.

===NPC appearances===
* {{g|Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl}}: Dugtrio and {{p|Diglett}} can be found roaming the halls of the [[Grand Underground]]. When 40 Diglett (or Dugtrio, which counts as 3) have been found, all players in the same Grand Underground session will receive a variety of bonuses for a period of 4 minutes. These include raising the odds of finding a [[Shiny Pokémon]] in a Pokémon Hideaway from 1/4096 to 1/2048 and forcing all Stone Boxes found when mining to become Pretty Stone Boxes.
* {{g|Pinball}}: Dugtrio appears in a bonus stage that can be accessed by the Red Table. After the player has knocked out a number of {{p|Diglett}}, they must knock out the Dugtrio that appears to win.
* {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team}}: Dugtrio sends the player to [[Mt. Steel]] to rescue his son in the third story mission of the game. Dugtrio loves to show off to his son, but often forgets that people can't see him underground.
* {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}}: Dugtrio is one of the members of the [[Wigglytuff's Guild|Wigglytuff Guild]]. He updates the Outlaw Notice Board and Job Bulletin Board with rotating boards. Like in the previous game, Diglett is his son. He believes that he can swim in the sea, despite being a Ground type.

====Trophy information====
''"A Mole Pokémon. It has three heads that seem to all think the same thing. It lives in caves and is skilled at digging--no matter how hard the ground is, it can dig up to 62 miles below the surface. It's among the fastest of Ground-type Pokémon, a characteristic that can be counted on in combat. Its {{m|Sand Tomb}} is an effective attack that prevents opponents from escaping."''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Dugtrio appears as a {{sbw|Spirit}} as well as returning in the Ground transformation of {{OBP|Pokémon Stadium 2|stage}}

==Trivia==
* Dugtrio and its pre-evolved form share their {{pkmn|category}} name with {{p|Drilbur}}. They are all known as the Mole Pokémon.
* Dugtrio has the highest base {{stat|Speed}} stat of all {{type|Ground}} Pokémon.
** Of all Pokémon to have the highest Speed stat of their respective types, Dugtrio is the slowest.
* Despite being the only species seen within the halls of the [[Grand Underground]] in {{g|Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl}}, Diglett and Dugtrio cannot actually be caught or traditionally encountered in any of the Pokémon Hideaways.
* [[Kanto|Kantonian]] Dugtrio and {{p|Wugtrio}} have exactly the same base stats in the same distribution. Their pre-evolved forms also evolve starting at the same level.
* {{rf|Alolan}} Dugtrio, {{p|Wugtrio}} and their pre-evolved forms share two {{Abilities}}, being {{a|Sand Veil}} and either {{a|Gooey}} or {{a|Tangling Hair}}, the latter two being variations of each other.
* In [[Generation IX]], prior to the Version 2.0.1 update of {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, Kantonian Dugtrio was unable to learn {{m|Helping Hand}} via [[TM]], while its pre-evolved form could.

===Design quirks===
* Due to being embedded in the ground, {{p|Diglett}} and Dugtrio have special interactions with certain mechanics in the [[Pokémon games]].
** In the [[Pokéathlon]], Diglett and Dugtrio are unable to jump. In Hurdle Dash, they dig under hurdles instead of jumping them, in Lamp Jump they cannot move, and in Disc Catch they can only move but not jump to catch the discs.
** Since [[Generation V]], when Diglett and Dugtrio are sent out, they merely fade onto the screen instead of dropping down like most other Pokémon. This trait is shared by Wiglett, Wugtrio, Sandygast, and Palossand.<!--even those that fly or levitate go down-->
** In the [[Poké Transfer]], Diglett and Dugtrio run between bushes rather than jumping between them.
** On the "Compare" screen of {{g|X and Y}}'s Pokédex, if the player taps the menu sprite of Diglett, Dugtrio, or {{me|Gengar}}, the Flying-type Pokémon will give up and disperse before even trying to lift it.
** Diglett, Dugtrio, {{p|Sandygast}}, {{p|Palossand}}, and {{me|Gengar}} are immune to {{m|Telekinesis}}.
** If a [[Z-Move]] animation, such as {{m|Supersonic Skystrike}}, results in showing Diglett or Dugtrio in the air, it is shown embedded in a floating chunk of ground.
* Dugtrio's body has been described inconsistently throughout the franchise's history. Originally, it was three Diglett forming a group of three, but more recent [[Pokédex entry|Pokédex entries]] claim it split from a single Diglett into three - sometimes separate, sometimes sharing a body.
* Despite being described as three Diglett in some sources, their official weight is listed as being well over the weight of three Diglett.
* Dugtrio is the only Ground-type {{DL|List of Pokémon by shape|Pokémon consisting of multiple bodies}}.

===Origin===
Dugtrio appears to be based on artificial {{wp|mole (animal)|mole}}s used in the {{wp|Whac-A-Mole}} arcade games. Dugtrio also resembles a group of moles poking their heads out of the ground. Specifically, this may be inspired by a particular defensive behavior of {{wp|naked mole-rat}}s, which block tunnels leading to their nest by lining up and exposing only their heads to threats like snakes.

Alolan Dugtrio's hair may be based on {{wp|Pele's hair}}, a thin {{wp|volcanic glass}} formed near {{wp|Hawaii}}an {{wp|volcano}}es. The lore of taking its hairs may reference the modern {{wp|Pele's Curse}}, while its reputation as a feminine deity may be a reference to {{wp|Pele (deity)|Pele}} herself. The darker soil surrounding its body may be a reference to {{wp|black sand}}, which is found on beaches near volcanoes. Its {{t|Steel}} type may be a reference to another kind of magnetic black sand found in {{wp|placer deposit}}s. It also resembles a stereotypical {{wp|Southern California}} {{wp|surfing|surfer}} with tanned skin and blonde hair. 

====Name origin====
Dugtrio may be a combination of ''dug'' and ''trio'' (a group of three).
