'''Sewaddle''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''クルミル''' ''Kurumiru'') is a dual-type {{2t|Bug|Grass}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation V]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Swadloon}} starting at [[level]] 20, which evolves into {{p|Leavanny}} when [[friendship Evolution|leveled up with high friendship]].

==Biology==
[[File:Ash Sewaddle Rolled Up.png|thumb|left|250px|Sewaddle sleeping by covering its head with its hood]]
Sewaddle is a caterpillar-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a broad, bitten leaf enfolding its head like a hood. Its large, spherical head is an orange-yellow with two small, close-together knobs on its forehead. Sewaddle's eyes are black and circular, and its mouth has a downward-pointing, crescent-shaped orange snout with a sharp tiny tooth at either end. The underside between the snout and its neck is white. Its green body has three segments with a pair of stubby, spherical orange legs on each segment. The bumps on Sewaddle's head are sensory organs.

Sewaddle makes itself leafy clothes using chewed-up leaves and a thread-like substance it produces from its mouth, though {{p|Leavanny}} tends to make its first set after hatching. By folding it over its face, its leafy hood is used to help hide it from enemies, whether awake or asleep. [[BW018|It has been shown]] to eat {{Berries}}, but when food is scarce it will eat its leafy clothing as an alternative. Sewaddle is a very popular mascot used by fashion designers. Sewaddle tend to greet each by rubbing their bumps together.

===Evolution===
Sewaddle evolves into {{p|Swadloon}}, which evolves into {{p|Leavanny}}.

==Trivia==
* Sewaddle was first seen after it was revealed on Yahoo's official Pokémon site. It was later released in the September issue of CoroCoro.
* Sewaddle was designed by [[Reiko Tanoue]].<ref>[http://raim2005.blog18.fc2.com/blog-entry-911.html Pokémon Peer interview] [http://pokebeach.com/2010/09/pokemon-peer-interview-translations (Translation by Pokebeach)]</ref>

===Origin===
Sewaddle appears to be based on the {{wp|caterpillar}} form of the {{wp|Epargyreus clarus|silver-spotted skipper}}, which produce silk and fold leaves over themselves for shelter. It also shares some characteristics with the larva of {{wp|Weaver ant|weaver ants}}, which produce silk used to form nests. It may also take inspiration from {{wp|Phylliidae|walking leaves}}. The large leaf around its head could represent a baby's bonnet.

====Name origin====
Sewaddle may be a combination of ''{{wp|sewing|sew}}'' and ''waddle'' (referring to how a baby walks) or ''swaddle'' (to wrap a baby in cloth).

Kurumiru may be derived from お包み ''okurumi'' (swaddle).
