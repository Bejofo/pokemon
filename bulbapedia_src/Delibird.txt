'''Delibird''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''デリバード''' ''Delibird'') is a dual-type {{2t|Ice|Flying}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation II]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

The [[Paradox Pokémon]] {{p|Iron Bundle}} is said to be a future relative of Delibird or a counterpart of it from a parallel timeline.

==Biology==
Delibird is a red, {{wp|Aves|avian}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a white, hollow, and bag-like tail. Its face and chest are covered in white feathers with two, three-pointed crests above its eyes. Black markings surround its circular eyes, and it has a light yellow beak and feet. There is a single white spot on its stomach. Its feet have two digits each.

Delibird is omnivorous and carries collected food bundled up in its tail, which it is frequently seen holding or tucking under its arm. It normally gives this stored food to its chicks, although it is generous enough to also share its food with other Pokémon and even humans, especially those lost or stranded in the mountains. Due to its omnivorous nature, however, it will sometimes offer bug Pokémon for these humans to eat. If attacked, it will also retaliate by throwing its food at the opponent. As mentioned in {{g|Sleep}}, Delibird is known to sleep while occasionally reaching inside its tail to pull something out.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref> Prior to [[Generation IX]], Delibird was the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Present}} by leveling up. Present allows it to carry special items in its tail that may cause damage or heal its opponent. In a flock, the Delibird with the largest tail is its leader. Delibird tends to live in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Mountain Pokémon|mountainous regions}}, making its nests over sharp cliffs; notably around Mt. Everest. {{p|Iron Bundle}} shares a resemblance to Delibird and is believed to be a Delibird-based machine built by an ancient civilization.

Delibird and its Paradox Pokémon counterpart, {{p|Iron Bundle}} are the only Pokémon capable of learning the move [[Present]] by leveling up.

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
* [[Pokémon Stadium 2]]: Delibird stars in its own mini-game called "Delibird's Delivery." In this game, players collect presents from one side of the field to the other. The player must avoid {{p|Swinub}} that scurry around or they will trip the Delibird and cause the player to lose the present they were carrying.
* [[Pokémon Channel]]: Delibird is the delivery boy for the "Shop 'n {{p|Squirtle}}."

==In animation==
[[File:Team Rocket Delibird.png|thumb|250px|Delibird in {{aniseries|JN}}]]
===Major appearances===
====[[Delibird (Team Rocket)]]====
Delibird made its animated series debut in ''[[EP231|Dues and Don'ts]]'', where one was affiliated with an [[Rocket Scout|elderly talent scout]] from [[Team Rocket]]. Since that episode, the {{pkmn|category|Delivery Pokémon}} kept following [[Jessie]], [[James]], and {{MTR}} to collect money that the three of them owe. Eventually, Delibird was unable to tail the [[Team Rocket trio]] ever since they moved to the [[Hoenn]] [[region]].

====Other====
Delibird debuted in ''[[PK08|Delibird's Dilemma]]'', under the ownership of [[Santa Claus]]. [[Ash's Totodile]] shot it clear out of the sky with a {{m|Water Gun}}-propelled snowball while it was delivering presents. As a result, {{AP|Pikachu}} and his friends had to help the Delivery Pokémon find the five presents before midnight.

===Minor appearances===
In ''[[DP095|Battling The Generation Gap!]]'', a {{pkmn|Coordinator}}'s Delibird competed in the {{to|Celestic}} {{pkmn|Contest}}.

Multiple Delibird appeared in ''[[M17|Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction]]''.

Three {{pkmn|Trainer}}s' Delibird appeared in ''[[M21|The Power of Us]]''.

In ''[[SM133|Battling on the Wing!]]'', a Trainer's Delibird watched the {{pkmn|battle}}s during the [[Manalo Conference]].

A Delibird appeared in ''[[HZ060|Roy and Fuecoco's First Snow!]]''.

===Pokédex entries===
{{Animedexheader|Johto}}
{{Animedexbody|EP231|Delibird|Ash's Pokédex|Delibird, the Delivery Pokémon. Delibird's most unique [[Move|attack]] is {{m|Present|giving presents}}. However, some of these presents have been known to explode. Sometimes, Delibird's presents can actually restore energy to its opponents.}}
{{Animedexfooter/Pokémon|Johto}}

==In the manga==
[[File:Masked Man Delibird.png|thumb|200px|Delibird in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===Pokémon Adventures===
===={{MangaArc|Gold, Silver & Crystal}}====
In ''[[PS103|You Ain't Nothin' but a Houndour]]'', a Delibird attacked {{adv|Gold}} under the command of the [[Masked Man]]. It is one of his most commonly used Pokémon. It appears to be the same Pokémon used by him in his alias, and was strong enough that it allowed him to capture {{p|Ho-Oh}}. However, Gold was able to knock it out with [[Polibo]]'s {{m|Perish Song}}.

[[Pryce]] owns a Delibird that first appeared with him in his Gym in ''[[PS143|Irked Igglybuff and Curmudgeonly Cleffa]]''. It is likely to be the same Delibird used by his alias.

===={{MangaArc|Diamond & Pearl}}====
In ''[[PS387|Striking Out Snover]]'', a wild Delibird was near [[Snowpoint City]], being cared for by [[Candice]].

===Pokémon: Yeah! I Got Pokémon!===
A Delibird appeared in [[GDZ67]], under the ownership of a {{OBP|monk|GDZ}}.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Delibird (TCG)}}

==Trivia==
* Delibird is one of the few Pokémon who can learn TM moves when it learns fewer than four moves by leveling up.
* Delibird has {{a|Insomnia}} as its [[Hidden Ability]] although it already has access to {{a|Vital Spirit}}, another Ability with exactly the same in-battle effect.
* Starting in {{game|Emerald}}, both of Delibird's regular Abilities have the same field effect, which is also shared by {{a|Pressure}}.

===Origin===
Aspects of Delibird's appearance appear to come from the {{wp|rockhopper penguin}}. However, its red-and-white color scheme, its ability to give presents, and the appearance of carrying its sack-like tail may have been derived from {{wp|Santa Claus}} (which is further supported by it being associated with the month of December in various events and it being one of Santa Claus's Pokémon in {{aniseries|PTS}}) and possibly the {{wp|white stork}}.

====Name origin====
Delibird may be a combination of ''delivery'' and ''bird''. ''Deli'' may have derived from the {{wp|Adélie penguin}}. Pronouncing ''Delibird'' with the same inflection as ''delivered'' yields a very similar pronunciation, with the "b" and "v" being the only variation between the two words. As the "v" sound does not exist in the Japanese language, it is commonly pronounced as a "b" sound by Japanese speakers.
