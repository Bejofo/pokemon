'''Haunter''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ゴースト''' ''Ghost'') is a dual-type {{2t|Ghost|Poison}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Gastly}} starting at [[level]] 25 and evolves into {{p|Gengar}} when [[Trade Evolution|traded]] or when exposed to a [[Linking Cord]].

(Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for more details.)

==Biology==
Haunter is a purple {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a gaseous body. It has a round head flanked by three large, spiked protrusions on either side. It has triangular eyes with small pupils and a mouth with a long, pink tongue. The gases composing its head curve into its mouth to form several pointed teeth. Disembodied hands with three clawed fingers each float in front of its body. Its body tapers into a jagged tail. Haunter's gaseous form makes it one of the [[List of Pokémon by weight|lightest Pokémon]] in existence.

Haunter hides in very dark places, such as {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Cave Pokémon|caves}}, and is afraid of light. If a human or a Pokémon comes near Haunter, it will stalk the victim while floating and beckon it to come closer. Once approached it will then lick the victim with its gaseous tongue, inflicting convulsions in the victim that last until death. It can also float through walls. It has been shown in ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' that it can control its hands from far away and can control any Pokémon that it touches with its hands. Haunter have also been depicted as being able to create illusions,<ref>''[[EP121|Illusion Confusion]]''</ref> pull out spirits from an individual’s body,<ref>''[[EP023|The Tower of Terror]]''</ref> and even remove its own eyes from its face<ref>''[[EP024|Haunter versus Kadabra]]''</ref>. Despite its predatory nature, it is known to entertain and prank people, such as in the episode ''[[EP023|The Tower of Terror]]''. Additionally, in ''[[EP095|A Shipful of Shivers]]'', it is even shown to feel intense loyalty to a deceased Trainer. As mentioned in {{g|Sleep}}, Haunter is known to sleep while floating.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref> A sleeping Haunter will steal the {{DL|Death in the Pokémon world|life-force}} of anyone who comes near using its gaseous tongue.

In [[Generation I]], {{m|Night Shade}} was its [[signature move]].

===Evolution===
Haunter evolves from {{p|Gastly}} and evolves into {{p|Gengar}}.

===Design variations===
{{main|Pokémon controversies#Four-fingered hands|Pokémon controversies → Four-fingered hands}}
Haunter's [[Generation I]] artworks, Generation I sprites (except {{v2|Yellow}}), and [[Generation III]] sprites depict Haunter with three fingers and one thumb. However, in most of Haunter's appearances in other media, such as throughout ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' (including the [[original series]]), it has always been depicted with two fingers and a thumb.

===Origin===
Haunter appears to be based on a {{wp|ghost}}. Its evolutionary line appears to depict a ghost crossing from the afterlife into the living world, with Haunter representing one that has partially broken through. This is further supported by {{p|Gengar}}'s forms being able to create portals to other dimensions and the afterlife.

Haunter shares many similarities with the {{wp|yōkai}} {{wp|akashita#Akaguchi|akaguchi}}, a creature with a wide mouth and a big tongue whose body is covered by dark clouds, making only its head and clawed hands visible. While Haunter's long tongue is a recurring detail among many yōkai, its vampiric licking might have come from some variants of the {{wp|akaname}}; or from the Dila, a Philippine spirit that licked the life energy of sick people until they died.

Some of Haunter's traits, such as its {{t|Poison}} type and extremely light weight, could be based on {{jwp|浮遊霊|fuyūrei}}, floating spirits said to be able to spread diseases. Similarly, its Poison type and association with gases may be a reference to the {{wp|miasma theory}}, a belief that diseases were caused by toxic vapors.

====Name origin====
Haunter may be derived from ''haunt'' and the {{wp|agent noun|agentive suffix}} ''-er'' or possibly ''hunter''.

Ghost is literally ''ghost''.
