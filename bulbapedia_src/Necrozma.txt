'''Necrozma''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ネクロズマ''' ''Necrozma'') is a {{type|Psychic}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation VII]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Necrozma has the following three [[#Form data|forms]]:
* '''Dusk Mane Necrozma''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ネクロズマ（たそがれのたてがみ）''' ''Necrozma ({{tt|Tasogare no Tategami|Dusk Mane}})''), a dual-type {{2t|Psychic|Steel}} fusion with {{p|Solgaleo}} using the [[N-Solarizer]].
* '''Dawn Wings Necrozma''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ネクロズマ（あかつきのつばさ）''' ''Necrozma ({{tt|Akatsuki no Tsubasa|Dawn Wings}})''), a dual-type {{2t|Psychic|Ghost}} fusion with {{p|Lunala}} using the [[N-Lunarizer]].
* '''Ultra Necrozma''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ウルトラネクロズマ''' ''Ultra Necrozma''), a dual-type {{2t|Psychic|Dragon}} form obtainable only in {{g|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon}} when either Dusk Mane Necrozma or Dawn Wings Necrozma holds the [[Ultranecrozium Z]] and uses [[Ultra Burst]].

Necrozma is the [[game mascot]] of both {{g|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon}}, appearing on their boxarts as Dusk Mane Necrozma and Dawn Wings Necrozma, respectively. Necrozma, {{p|Solgaleo}}, and {{p|Lunala}} are often collectively referred to as the [[light trio]] by fans. It is associated with the [[guardian deities]]. It is [[Ultra_Beast#Related_Pokémon|related]] to the [[Ultra Beast]]s, but is not usually considered to be one itself in its base form.

==Biology==
[[File:Necrozma 2 SM concept art.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Necrozma's face is actually its brain prism]]
Necrozma is a vaguely humanoid {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} whose body appears to be constructed out of a black crystalline material. Necrozma's body is primarily prismatic and black due to the amount of impurities in its system. The large protrusion attached to its head is its tail, which has a row of three large spikes along the top and is white in the back with a dark gray symbol resembling a eight-pointed star in the center. Its face is actually a prism-like object known as the "brain prism", which possesses a collection of multicolored shapes that resemble eyes. While absorbing light, this brain prism glows white.<ref>[[Pokémon Sun & Pokémon Moon: The Official Alola Region Pokédex & Postgame Adventure Guide]]</ref> Its thin arms have disproportionately large hands with three claws. Jutting out of the back of each hand is a whitish crystal that darkens toward the tip, and each elbow has a hook-like spike. Two large spikes jut from each shoulder and there is a row of smaller spikes along each side of its body. Its feet have three hook-like toes each.

Necrozma originates from [[Ultra Space]] and is capable of opening and traveling through [[Ultra Wormhole]]s. This causes many to believe Necrozma is one of the Ultra Beasts, however, different accounts refer to Necrozma as a "reminiscent of the Ultra Beasts" and "a creature almost like an Ultra Beast". It once had the ability to give light in its original form, but lost this ability along its true form after being heavily injured by the [[Ultra Recon Squad]]'s ancestors in an attempt to steal its light; [[Professor Kukui]] and [[Lillie]] theorize that the [[Sparkling Stone]]s and the [[Z-Crystal]]s used to perform [[Z-Move]]s are fragments of Necrozma's body that it lost upon being injured and rained down into [[Alola]]. According to the Ultra Recon Squad, the light that radiates from Necrozma is the [[Z-Power|aura]] that surrounds the Trainer and Pokémon while performing a Z-Move and the aura surrounding a [[Totem Pokémon]]. This energy is consumed by Pokémon such as the [[Ultra Beast]]s and radiated by Pokémon such as {{p|Solgaleo}} and {{p|Lunala}}.

Necrozma displays extremely violent behavior due to the constant, maddening pain it suffers in its incomplete state. Desperate for the light it requires to sustain itself and regain its original form, Necrozma absorbs light from other beings and places. This behavior caused it to be feared as and known as a "pillager of light" in ancient times. Necrozma has an eternal conflict that cycles with Solgaleo and Lunala for their limitless light energy.<ref>[[Kazumasa Iwao]]: ''"These three are always struggling against one another in [[Ultra Space]]."'' Pokémon Ultra Sun & Pokémon Ultra Moon Edition: The Official National Pokédex (Pokemon (Prima Official Guide/Official Pokedex Guide))</ref>Necrozma usually absorbs the light energy from either {{p|Solgaleo}} or {{p|Lunala}}, or sometimes both, resulting in the respective Legendary Pokémon chasing after Necrozma to regain its light energy.<ref>[[Kazumasa Iwao]]: ''"Necrozma might steal the light of the others and flee, then Solgaleo and Lunala might give  and take back the light back-and on and on it would go."'' Pokémon Ultra Sun & Pokémon Ultra Moon Edition: The Official National Pokédex (Pokemon (Prima Official Guide/Official Pokedex Guide))</ref>

Its black coloration is a result of impurities building up within it as a result of its deep slumber. Necrozma can {{m|Prismatic Laser|shoot powerful lasers using the power of a prism}}. These lasers are powerful enough to blast through anything it hits.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180911084734/https://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/ultra/en-us/gallery-detail-3.html | Necrozma] (Archived)</ref> It can also attack its foes with {{m|Photon Geyser|a large pillar of light}}. Using its tail, it is able to propel itself by shooting black light from it. When Necrozma absorbs light from a world, that world becomes shrouded in darkness until the stolen light is returned as seen temporarily in [[Alola]] and in [[Ultra Megalopolis]]. In {{aniseries|SM}}, the [[Aether Foundation]] confused Necrozma for an Ultra Beast and gave it a code name, "UB: Black". As seen in ''[[SM087|Filling the Light with Darkness]]'', Necrozma is capable of absorbing a world's [[Z-Power|Ultra Aura]], which causes adults to become more tired and lose motivation. Necrozma loves [[Necrozma Treat]]s made by [[Snacksworth]], who once encountered and roared loudly to intimidate it in the past.

Necrozma is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the moves {{m|Prismatic Laser}} and {{m|Photon Geyser}}. It is also the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Prism Armor}} as an Ability.

===Forms===
Necrozma has three additional forms: Dusk Mane Necrozma, Dawn Wings Necrozma, and Ultra Necrozma.

Necrozma can take control of {{p|Solgaleo}} or {{p|Lunala}} by forcefully fusing with them, dominating their bodies and eclipsing their minds to assume its Dusk Mane or Dawn Wings forms, respectively. However, Necrozma is also able to coexist with its host willingly, regardless of {{pkmn|fusion}}.<ref>{{mas|Lusamine}}: ''"It doesn't seem like Necrozma or Solgaleo are suffering in their current state. I suppose now that they have the light of our [[sync stone]], they're able to coexist peacefully."''([[Pokémon Masters EX]])</ref><ref>[[Lillie]]''"<player>, I know this may be sudden, but I hope you will consider what I ask of you. I want to entrust [[Nebby]] to you. I think Nebby should be with {{ga|Necrozma}}. From what I've heard, Necrozma would not suffer as much or ache so for the light if it can remain close to Nebby..."''([[Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon]])</ref> That can be done naturally by itself or artificially through the use of the [[N-Solarizer]] or [[N-Lunarizer]], respectively. Because Necrozma is forcibly absorbing their limitless light energy, Solgaleo and Lunala constantly glow while fused like in their Radiant Sun and Full Moon Phases. In both cases, the host's body is covered in pieces of Necrozma's body, which are arranged like armor, and Necrozma wields powers that exceed its respective host; it's powerful enough to open multiple Ultra Wormholes at once across a large area. When fused to either Solgaleo or Lunala, Necrozma becomes uncontrollably vicious and constantly rampages, treating anything it sees as an enemy and brutally attacking them with either its claws or its lasers, which can cut through anything. The main reason is due the respective Legendary Pokémon's limitless energy being much more excessive than what Necrozma needs.<ref>[[Kazumasa Iwao]]: ''"As a result-and even though it really only needed a small amount of energy-Necrozma comes to gain a huge amount of energy, beyond what Necrozma itself anticpated, when it captures Solgaleo or Lunala. And because of excessive amount of energy, Necrozma goes beserk."'' Pokémon Ultra Sun & Pokémon Ultra Moon Edition: The Official National Pokédex (Pokemon (Prima Official Guide/Official Pokedex Guide))</ref> 

;Dusk Mane Necrozma
[[File:Dusk Mane Necrozma USUM concept art.jpg|thumb|250px|{{p|Solgaleo}} taken over by Necrozma]]
Dusk Mane Necrozma resembles an armored Solgaleo with Necrozma as body armor. Dusk Mane Necrozma has armor around its paws, head, and sides. Necrozma's tail splits into two and attaches to the sides of Solgaleo's torso and its large claws extend from Solgaleo's back. The front feet have five black claws attached to them with two V-shaped crystals on top of it while the back foot has only three claws. It has a triangular helmet with a long, thin antenna on each side and Necrozma's brain prism is prominently displayed. Solgaleo's own eyes and nose are visible as bright, blue lights. The host's tail gains three black spikes attached to each other, as well as three spikes under the chin. A structure similar to one of Necrozma's legs extends from its back. 

As Dusk Mane Necrozma, Necrozma {{pkmn|fusion|takes over}} Solgaleo's body and mind. Dusk Mane Necrozma is said be more powerful than Solgaleo. It can use the six powered-up claws on its four legs and back to pounce on on foes. Dusk Mane Necrozma uses these six claws to deal slicing damage onto the opponent. Using the armor on its chest, it is able to propel itself by shooting black light.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180913011006/https://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/ultra/en-us/gallery-detail-8.html Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon site | Dusk Mane Solgaleo]</ref> It uses Solgaleo's limitless energy to both feed it energy and fuel its endless rampage.

Dusk Mane Necrozma and {{p|Solgaleo}} are the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Sunsteel Strike}}. They are also the only known Pokémon capable of using the [[Z-Move]] {{m|Searing Sunraze Smash}}.
{{left clear}}

;Dawn Wings Necrozma
[[File:Dawn Wings Necrozma USUM concept art.jpg|thumb|left|250px|{{p|Lunala}} taken over by Necrozma]]
Dawn Wings Necrozma resembles an armored Lunala with Necrozma as body armor. Dawn Wings Necrozma has armor around its torso, head, and certain parts of its wings and tail. It also has a triangular helmet with the brain prism visible, as well as Lunala's own eyes visible as glowing pink lights. Necrozma's arms extend from the center of its chest. The armor surrounding its body has two large spikes jutting up from around its shoulders and four, glowing pink lights in the center. On its lower back are two thin, antennae-like growths extending downward. A structure similar to Necrozma's tail extends from the center of its back, and like its Dusk Mane form, can be used as a form of propulsion. There are eleven crystalline spikes attached around the body, four each on the wings, and three on Lunala's tail. 

Dawn Wings Necrozma is a {{pkmn|fusion}} of Necrozma and Lunala, leaving Lunala with no will of its own. Dawn Wings Necrozma is said to be more powerful than Lunala. These spines are capable of firing dark energy.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20190728010514/https://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/ultra/en-us/gallery-detail-9.html Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon site | Dawn Wings Lunala]</ref> Dawn Wings Necrozma uses this dark energy to  quickly reach and attack enemies in a furious rush. It uses Lunala's limitless energy to both feed it energy and fuel its endless rampage.

Dawn Wings Necrozma and {{p|Lunala}} are the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Moongeist Beam}}. They are also the only known Pokémon capable of using the [[Z-Move]] {{m|Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom}}.
{{left clear}}

;Ultra Necrozma
[[File:Necrozma Photon Geyser Adventures.png|thumb|right|250px|Ultra Necrozma firing {{m|Photon Geyser|laser beams}} from every part of its body]]
When Necrozma absorbs overwhelming amounts of light energy and [[Z-Power]], it undergoes [[Ultra Burst]], which causes it to split apart and then reform into its true form, Ultra Necrozma. It can achieve this by taking control of a {{p|Solgaleo}} or a {{p|Lunala}} while [[Held item|holding]] an [[Ultranecrozium Z]]. Alternatively, as seen in the {{Aniseries|Sun and Moon}} episode ''[[SM090|Securing the Future!]]'', it can transform into Ultra Necrozma by absorbing Z-Power directly from [[Z-Move]]s used against it, or, as seen in the [[Pokémon Adventures]] episode ''[[PASM35|Transcend!! Ultra Necrozma!]]'' by directly absorbing the Ultranecrozium Z.

Ultra Necrozma is a colossal dragon Pokémon, composed mostly of pure light energy that it had stored from a great energy source before its transformation. This body of light is supported by a sort of skeleton made from the various pieces of Necrozma's crystalline body; these pieces take on a golden glow from the light, but they return to black without it. Its sheer size makes it the [[List of Pokémon by height|tallest]] known {{type|Psychic}} Pokémon. Its head is surrounded by several spikes and a pair of small wings, which causes it to resemble an eight-pointed star; there is also a small, lighter eight-pointed star on the back of its head. Its face is armored and has multicolored {{wp|Heterochromia iridum|heterochromic}} eyes; the left eye is primarily red, while the right is mainly blue. The patterns around its eyes resemble the Ultranecrozium Z. It has two pairs of wings: one around its shoulders and one around its hips. While the wings themselves are made of light, the arm portions are made of its former legs and shoulders, respectively. Its former arms now cover its lower legs, and what was once its tail covers its chest. Finally, it has a long tail with a row of spikes along the top.

Necrozma is at its full power in this form, radiating energy that has all sorts of effects on living beings and even nature itself. Its body temperature exceeds 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5,540 degrees Celsius); anything that it touches will melt from the extreme heat. It can fire laser beams from every part of its body, and these lasers can reach over 18 miles away, burning through everything in their path.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20191127065207/https://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/ultra/en-us/gallery-detail-17.html Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon site | Ultra Necrozma]</ref> While swinging its four wings around, Ultra Necrozma uses its superheated claws to tear its opponents to shreds. In this form, it is known as the "blinding one" due to its brilliant appearance. As seen in ''[[SM089|The Prism Between Light and Darkness!]]'', when Ultra Necrozma uses up all its light, it reverts to its lightless form and enters into a deep slumber unless it absorbs more light.

Ultra Necrozma is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of using the [[Z-Move]] {{m|Light That Burns the Sky}}. It is also the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Neuroforce}} as an [[Ability]].

====Form change====
When Necrozma is fused, it tries to learn a new move in the same way that other Pokémon may learn new moves upon evolving. If Necrozma changes to its normal form, it immediately forgets the special move of the form it was in (if it still knows it); if the only move that Necrozma knows is the form's special move, then that move will be replaced with {{m|Confusion}}.

===Form data===
Necrozma has three additional forms: Dusk Mane Necrozma, Dawn Wings Necrozma, and Ultra Necrozma. All three of these forms were introduced in {{g|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon}}.

Dusk Mane Necrozma is the form it attains from absorbing {{p|Solgaleo}}. The player can induce and undo this fusion with the [[N-Solarizer]]. After fusing, Necrozma will attempt to learn {{m|Sunsteel Strike}}, and can hold [[Solganium Z]] to access Solgaleo's exclusive [[Z-Move]], {{m|Searing Sunraze Smash}}. Its [[cry]] is a combination of normal Necrozma and Solgaleo's cries.

Dawn Wings Necrozma is the form it attains from absorbing {{p|Lunala}}. The player can induce and undo this fusion with the [[N-Lunarizer]]. After fusing, Necrozma will attempt to learn {{m|Moongeist Beam}}, and can hold [[Lunalium Z]] to access Lunala's exclusive Z-Move, {{m|Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom}}. Its cry is a combination of normal Necrozma and Lunala's cries.

If Necrozma separates from Solgaleo or Lunala while it knows the borrowed move (Sunsteel Strike or Moongeist Beam), that move will be forgotten. If the borrowed move was its only [[move]], Necrozma will learn {{m|Confusion}}.

Due to the mechanics of the N-Solarizer and N-Lunarizer, each player can have a maximum of one Dusk Mane Necrozma and one Dawn Wings Necrozma at a time per game (though having both at the same time requires [[Trade|trading]] or [[transfer]]ring for a second Necrozma). If it is fused with Solgaleo or Lunala, Necrozma cannot be traded, [[release]]d, or deposited into {{g|Bank}} or {{g|HOME}}.

Ultra Necrozma is a third form Necrozma can attain if it enters a {{pkmn|battle}} in its Dusk Mane or Dawn Wings form while holding its exclusive [[Z-Crystal]], [[Ultranecrozium Z]], at which point the player can use the [[Ultra Burst]] command from the move menu to transform it into Ultra Necrozma. Once transformed, Ultra Necrozma can also use the Ultranecrozium Z on a subsequent turn to upgrade {{m|Photon Geyser}} into its exclusive Z-Move, {{m|Light That Burns the Sky}}. Ultra Necrozma will revert to its previous form when it [[Fainting|faints]] or when the battle ends. Ultra Burst can only be used once per battle, even if the player has multiple Necrozma or revives a fainted Necrozma. Ultra Necrozma is only obtainable in {{g|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon}}.

==In animation==
===Main series===
[[File:Necrozma anime.png|thumb|250px|Necrozma in {{aniseries|SM}}]]
====Major appearances====
====={{an|Necrozma|Necrozma (anime)}}=====
Necrozma physically debuted in ''[[SM087|Filling the Light with Darkness!]]''. It was an antagonist in an arc of {{aniseries|SM}} involving {{AP|Poipole}}'s [[Poipole's world|homeworld]] until ''[[SM090|Securing the Future!]]'', where it was restored back to [[#Form data|Ultra Necrozma]] when given [[Z-Power|Ultra Aura]] by the people of Alola. Its Ultra Beast codename, '''UB Black''' (Japanese: '''{{tt|ＵＢ:ＢＬＡＣＫ|ユービー：ブラック}}''' ''UB: Black''), has only been given in the animated series.

====Minor appearances====
[[#Form data|Ultra Necrozma]] appeared in ''[[SM074|Tough Guy Trials!]]'', during a fantasy. [[Acerola]] showed {{Ash}} a book containing a legend detailing the origins of [[Alola]], in which Ultra Necrozma, {{p|Solgaleo}}, and {{p|Lunala}} first brought light to the [[region]]. The ancient people dubbed Necrozma, who shined the brightest out of all three, the "Blinding One". {{TRT}} also heard the story and contacted {{an|Giovanni}} about it, only to find out from [[Matori]] that he already knew of Necrozma and ended the transmission, much to their surprise.

[[File:Dawn Wings Necrozma Evolutions.png|thumb|250px|Dawn Wings Necrozma in Pokémon Evolutions]]
Necrozma appeared in ''[[PE02|The Eclipse]]'', where it appeared from an [[Ultra Wormhole]]. [[Nebby]] battled against it, but ended up being absorbed.
{{-}}

==In the manga==
[[File:Necrozma Adventures.png|thumb|250px|Necrozma in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===Pokémon Adventures===
{{main|Necrozma (Adventures)}}
Necrozma first appeared in ''[[PASM25|Summon the Emissaries of the Moon and the Sun]]'', emerging from an [[Ultra Wormhole]] at the [[Poni Altar]] and possessing {{p|Solgaleo}} to become its Dusk Mane form. Dusk Mane Necrozma then grabbed {{adv|Sun}} and dragged him into the wormhole with it, forcing {{adv|Moon}} and [[Nebby|Lunala]] to chase after them. It later reappeared in [[Ultra Megalopolis]], whose citizens worship it as "the Blinding One."

[[Lusamine]], seeking to {{pkmn2|Caught|capture}} Necrozma, followed it to Ultra Megalopolis, but was sucked back into Alola through an [[Ultra Wormhole]] before she could do so. On [[Mount Lanakila]], Necrozma changed into its Ultra form and fought against {{adv|Zygarde}}, {{p|Solgaleo}}, and [[Nebby|Lunala]] before being defeated by them and subsequently caught by [[Zossie]].

==Other Appearances==

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Necrozma appears as a {{sbw|Spirit}}.

==Trivia==
* Necrozma has many differences from the other members of [[Light trio|its trio]]. It is the only member:
** To have its own exclusive [[Z-Move]] and [[Z-Crystal]] (Solgaleo and Lunala share theirs with [[#Form data|Dusk Mane and Dawn Wings]] Necrozma, respectively).
** Without a pre-evolved form.
** To have more than one signature [[Ability]], as it has two.
** With multiple [[signature move]]s.
** With a [[base stat]] that is not a {{wp|prime number}} (Dusk Mane, Dawn Wings, and Ultra Necrozma's {{stat|Speed}} stats).
* Necrozma's base form shares its battle theme with {{p|Solgaleo}} and {{p|Lunala}}.
* In {{g|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon}} and {{g|Sword and Shield}}, Necrozma has a catch rate of 255.
* In {{g|Sun and Moon}}, Necrozma has a base [[experience]] yield of 120.
* Dawn Wings Necrozma is tied with {{p|Giratina}}, {{p|Lunala}}, and {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Calyrex|Shadow Rider}} {{p|Calyrex}} for the highest base stat total of all {{type|Ghost}} Pokémon.
** Dawn Wings Necrozma is the only {{DL|List of Pokémon by color|blue}} {{type|Ghost}} Pokémon.
* Ultra Necrozma is the [[List of Pokémon with unique base stat totals|only Pokémon]] with a base stat total of 754 and the only {{type|Psychic}} {{DL|List of Pokémon by shape|Pokémon with two or more pairs of wings}}.
* Necrozma has the [[List of Pokémon by shape|most shapes]] of all Pokémon with a total of four between its different forms.
* Necrozma's status as an [[Ultra Beast]] differs between media.
** In the [[core series]] games, Necrozma is not an Ultra Beast. [[Beast Ball]]s are ineffective against it and regular Poké Balls are normally effective against it. Additionally, Necrozma's Pokémon Sun [[Pokédex]] entry and [[Dulse]] clarify that it is similar to the Ultra Beasts, but not one of them.
*** In {{g|HOME}}, Necrozma is not registered as a species of Ultra Beast.
** In the {{pkmn|animated series}}, it, alongside the other members of the [[light trio]] and their pre-evolved forms, are referred to as Ultra Beasts before their true identities are discovered. Necrozma is given the codename of '''UB Black''' (Japanese: '''{{tt|ＵＢ:ＢＬＡＣＫ|ユービー：ブラック}}''' ''UB: Black'').
** In the [[Pokémon Adventures]] {{pkmn|manga}}, Necrozma is considered an Ultra Beast, with Beast Balls being used to attempt and eventually succeed in catching it.
** In the TCG, Dusk Mane, Dawn Wings, and Ultra Necrozma are classified as {{TCG|Ultra Beast}}s, while its base form is not.
*** [[Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket|TCG Pocket]] follows the same convention for its iteration of [[Ultra Beast (TCG Pocket)|Ultra Beasts]].
** In [[Pokémon Duel]], all forms of Necrozma are considered Ultra Beasts.
** In [[Pokémon GO]], Necrozma is not classified as an Ultra Beast. However, because it appears in Ultra Wormhole {{GO|Raid Battle}}s, Beast Balls have an increased catch rate just as they do for Ultra Beasts.
* Necrozma has access to the most exclusive [[Z-Crystal]]s, with a total of three.
* Necrozma's [[effort value]]s [[List of Pokémon by effort value yield|yield]] of 1 Attack and 2 Special Attack is unique.
* Of the Pokémon capable of fusion with another Pokémon, Necrozma is the only one:
** That does not have equal base Attack and Special Attack stats.
** That has an additional transformation.
** For which the player can legitimately have both fused forms on a single save file due to the fact that each of Necrozma's fusions utilize their own [[Key Item]].
* Necrozma is the first Pokémon to serve as the main antagonist of a core series game.
* Dusk Mane Necrozma is the only {{type|Steel}} Pokémon to not be able to learn {{m|Steel Beam}}.

===Origin===
Necrozma could be based on the concept of {{wp|prism}}s and {{wp|light refraction}}. This may tie to {{g|Sun and Moon}} being codenamed "ニジ" (Rainbow), as well as {{wp|Hawaii}}, the location [[Alola]] was inspired by, being referred to as the "rainbow state". Its design may also incorporate similarities, both literal and symbolic, to {{wp|black dwarf}}s, {{wp|black hole}}s, or {{wp|neutron star}}s, which may be represented by the star symbol on the back of its head. Necrozma's concept and design may be inspired by multiple depictions of aliens across various forms of media. This is indicated by its unusually proportioned limbs, large head, and {{t|Psychic}} [[type]], which is often associated with intelligence, for aliens are often depicted to have more intellect than humans in science fiction. It also remotely resembles a dragon's skeleton, which could correlate to its [[Pokédex]] entry in {{pkmn|Sword and Shield|Pokémon Sword}} mentioning that it has spent a long time "slumbering underground."

Necrozma's Dusk Mane and Dawn Wings forms may be based on the concept of {{wp|Solar eclipse|solar}} and {{wp|lunar eclipse}}s, respectively. The forms' alternate names in Japanese, 日食 ''nisshoku'' (solar eclipse) and 月食 ''gesshoku'' (lunar eclipse) can also be literally translated as "eating the sun/moon", reflecting how Necrozma absorbs Solgaleo or Lunala to assume those forms. Its Ultra Necrozma form may be based on {{wp|giant star}}s or {{wp|supernova}}e. Design-wise, Dusk Mane Necrozma and Dawn Wings Necrozma retain Solgaleo's {{wp|lion}} and Lunala's {{wp|bat}} bases, respectively, while Ultra Necrozma resembles a four-winged {{wp|wyvern}}. The fact that Necrozma transforms into a {{type|Dragon}} could be based on legends about the {{wp|Moʻo}}.

Another possible inspiration for Ultra Necrozma are the {{wp|quasars}}. Originating from the feeding process of a supermassive black hole, quasars are the most luminous objects known in the universe. They consist of a black hole surrounded by an accretion disk made of superheated gas spiraling around it.

Ultra Necrozma's dragon motif might have been inspired by the {{wp|ouroboros}} — a common symbol in alchemy, typically depicted as a dragon (often a wyvern <ref>[[wp:File:Ouroboros 1.jpg]]</ref>) biting its own tail, symbolizing cyclical renewal and rebirth. This aligns with Necrozma’s standard form, which is thematically associated with death. In alchemy, there are depictions of dragons alongside the sun and moon as an allegory of "philosophical quicksilver" <ref>[https://www.blackdrago.com/topics/alchemy.htm]</ref> — a hypothetical substance believed to be essential for uniting opposing principles (symbolized by the sun and moon) in the creation of the philosopher's stone. <ref>[https://archive.org/details/alchemy-and-mysticism/page/n57/mode/2up]</ref>

Necrozma's original form resembling an angelic being of light may be based on the concept of a {{wp|fallen angel}}. Specifically, it may draw inspiration from {{wp|Lucifer}}, who is viewed as a bringer of light and associated with {{wp|Venus}}, the third brightest natural object in the sky behind only the Sun and the Moon, which are represented by the other 2 members of the light trio, it may also be based on the poison dripping dragon. <ref>[https://electromagneticfrontier.blogspot.com/2009/08/aurelia-occulta.html]</ref>

====Name origin====
Necrozma may be a combination of νεκρός ''nekrós'' (Ancient Greek for dead), 黒 ''kuro'' (black), and πρῖσμα ''prîsma'' (Ancient Greek for prism) or ''plasma'' (state of matter most commonly found in stars). The letter Z might have been used to symbolize the idea of "end", as it is the final letter of the Latin alphabet. It may also involve ''{{wp|Project Ozma}}'', an experiment made to search for extraterrestrial life.
