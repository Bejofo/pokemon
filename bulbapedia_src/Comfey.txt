'''Comfey''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''キュワワー''' ''Cuwawa'') is a {{type|Fairy}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation VII]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

==Biology==
[[File:Comfey SM concept art.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Concept art of Comfey for {{g|Sun and Moon}}]]
Comfey is a small, light green {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with several flowers surrounding it. Its main body has an orange face with oval, light green eyes. On top of its head is a long, fluffy green crest that curls slightly over its face and extends backward. Comfey produce thin blue thread-like vines that come from the back of its head and may have several flowers attached to it. the flowers are attached to rounded "stems" of the same color as the vine. When not in use, these vines curl into a detail-less dome shape on the top of the head, which is wrapped around by the green crest. Yellow fur or feather-like fluff from the sides of their face extend to its back and the top of its scalp from which its blue vine stems from. Comfey are usually seen with flowers that are white, purple, red, and yellow in all visual media, however each Comfey wear different flowers. Comfey usually hold the of one of its vine with its two short arms. Comfey is one of the [[List of Pokémon by height|shortest Pokémon]] in existence.

This Pokémon stretches sticky vines from its head to pick flowers to create the ring around itself and will give these rings to those it likes. The flowers can also be thrown at enemy Pokémon to create an opening to either flee or attack. However, it feels uneasy without flowers. Comfey spread oil from their body along these flower rings, changing the flowers so that they emit a soothing fragrance that affects both Comfey and its allies. This aroma can also help with the treatment of people and Pokémon at hospitals and [[Pokémon Center]]s.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20161118233915mp_/http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/comfey/ Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Comfey]</ref> Each Comfey wear different flowers, which give off its own unique scent and never wither. As mentioned in {{g|Sleep}}, Comfey is known to sleep with a smile and a flower close to its face.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref> The flower is said to have a scent that helps it sleep comfortably.

Comfey is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Floral Healing}}. It is also the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Triage}} as an [[Ability]]. In [[Generation VIII]], this was also true for {{a|Flower Veil}}.

===Origin===
Comfey appears to be based on a {{wp|lei (garland)|lei}}, a type of wreath that are widely associated with {{wp|Hawaii}}an culture, the design origin of the [[Alola]] region. Lei are often, but not always, made up of flowers, seeds, leaves, and/or vines; and are used to honor people or commemorate certain events. They are usually a symbolization of love and hospitality, which Comfey's friendly behavior and use in hospitals may be inspired from. Some of Comfey's [[Pokédex entry|Pokédex entries]] seem to be references to aromatherapy and perhaps herbal medicine.

====Name origin====
Comfey may be a combination of ''comfy'', ''comfort'', ''{{wp|comfrey}}'', ''{{wp|fairy|fey}}'', and ''lei''.

Cuwawa may be a combination of ''cure'', ''cute,'' 輪 ''wa'' (ring), and フラワー ''furawā'' (flower).
