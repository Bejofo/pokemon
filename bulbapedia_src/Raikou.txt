'''Raikou''' (Japanese: '''ライコウ''' ''Raikou'') is an {{type|Electric}} {{pkmn2|Legendary}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation II]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

Along with {{p|Entei}} and {{p|Suicune}}, it is one of the [[Legendary beasts]] resurrected by {{p|Ho-Oh}} after the burning of the [[Burned Tower|Brass Tower]]. Of the three Legendary beasts, Raikou is said to represent the lightning strike which ignited the fire that consumed the Brass Tower.

The [[Paradox Pokémon]] {{p|Raging Bolt}} is said to be either an ancient relative of Raikou or a counterpart of it from a parallel timeline.

==Biology==
Raikou is a quadrupedal, yellow, {{wp|tiger}}-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with black stripes and a white underside. It has a thin, light blue tail with sharp angles and a spark-shaped formation at the end. Most of its face consists of thick, white fur and shorter yellow fur around its red eyes. Raikou's muzzle is a light blue "X" and it has a black faceplate with two bumps that cover its forehead, nose, and ears. Raikou has two long fangs that make its appearance similar to the {{wp|saber-toothed cat}}. Its large claws each converge to form a single point and never retract. Extra fur hangs off its body in front of its thighs. Raikou has a mane across its back that resembles dull purple rain clouds and allows it to shoot bolts of lightning.

150 years ago, [[Burned Tower|Brass Tower]] in [[Johto]] was hit by a lightning bolt, causing it to catch on a huge fire and would be later put out by a sudden downpout. [[List of disputed and unidentified Pokémon|Three unnamed Pokémon]] perished in the fire, however, the [[Legendary Pokémon]] {{p|Ho-Oh}} granted the trio new life, one of those Pokémon was revived as Raikou, which represents the lightning that struck the now Burned Tower.

A proverb claims that Raikou descended from the sky with a lightning bolt. Raikou is able to fly by creating storm clouds, as depicted in the [[Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs (animated special)]]. In ''[[The Legend of Thunder!]]'', Raikou is shown to be distrustful of humans, though it may form some friendship with those who help it. Raikou tends to appear during thunderstorms and when other Electric-type Pokémon are in danger. Raikou is said to represent the speed of lightning and can control storm clouds at will. Raikou races across {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|grasslands}} while barking cries that sound like thunder. Raikou's cries can also send shock waves in the air while shaking the ground at the same time. Raikou loves [[Raikou Treat]]s made by [[Snacksworth]], who once encountered and raced up a mountain with it in the past. {{p|Raging Bolt}} bears a resemblance to Raikou. According to Occulture, Raging Bolt is believed to be an ancestor of Raikou.

As mentioned in  the [[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]], while Raikou is sleeping, its breath makes a rumbling sound similar to distant thunder.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex entry]]: "This Pokémon embodies the speed of lightning. It's said that when Raikou sleeps deeply, you can hear a rumbling like distant thunder in its breath. When it wakes, it sweeps once more across the land, roaring like crashing thunder."</ref> The moment Raikou awakens, it will quickly travel the lands, with a roar sounding similar to a crashing thunder. Raikou is known to enjoy eating Raikou Biscuits. Raikou can be lured over to a sleeping spot using the Raikou Incense. Raikou has three different sleep styles it sleeps in: ''Energy-Storing Sleep'',  ''Meditative Sleep'', and ''Lightning Sleep''.

* {{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}}: Raikou first appears alongside {{p|Suicune}} up on [[Revelation Mountain]], where they confront {{mdc|Krookodile|smd}}, believing he turned {{p|Entei}} to stone, only to discover that {{mdc|Nuzleaf|smd}} was the actual culprit. Raikou later helps the {{player}} and {{mdc|Partner Pokémon||partner}} escape from the [[Voidlands]]. He goes by the title "Raikou the Lightning".

'''PAL:''' ''If you see a bolt of lightning flash across the ground instead of from the sky, you may have just caught a glimpse of Raikou.

==Trivia==
[[File:Raikou dex entry LoT.png|thumb|230px|Raikou in {{jo|Jimmy}}'s Pokédex]]
* Raikou is the only {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} in the {{pkmn|animated series}} whose image on the [[Pokédex]] was of stylized art rather than the standard art by the series character designer.
* Raikou's [[Effort values|effort value]] [[List of Pokémon by effort value yield|yield]] of 1 Special Attack and 2 Speed is unique.
* Raikou's numbers in the [[National Pokédex]] and the [[List of Pokémon by Johto Pokédex number|Johto Pokédex]] are identical: 0243 and 243, respectively.

===Concept and development===
In the [[Pokémon Gold and Silver Spaceworld '97 demo|Nintendo Space World '97 demo]] of Pokémon Gold and Silver, Raikou is seen with a design resembling a jackal. In the final game, Raikou is seen with an orange mane, more subdued faceplate, and lacking its blue "whiskers". This was changed in {{game|Crystal}}, which more accurately depicts Raikou's final design.

Raikou, along with {{p|Entei}} and {{p|Suicune}}, was designed by [[Muneo Saitō]].<ref>Yoshida, Yuuya (May 1, 2014). [https://kai-you.net/article/5034 伝説ポケモンのイラストを手がける斉藤むねお、キャラデザ講座開講！] Kai-You.</ref><ref>(January 3, 2012). Ken Sugimori ([https://twitter.com/SUPER_32X @SUPER_32X]) [https://twitter.com/SUPER_32X/status/154156622212640768 on Twitter]. ([https://archive.vn/WfQab archive])</ref>

When asked if the [[Legendary beasts]] were based on any particular animals, Muneo Saitō explained that after {{p|Entei}}'s design came to be lion-like, he decided to incorporate leopard-like and tiger-like elements for Suicune and Raikou, respectively. Raikou's creation process was described as difficult, as "Raikou took many twists and turns; there was even a blue thunder version with a drum on its back".<ref name="Saitō">(January 3, 2012). Muneo Saitō ([https://twitter.com/muneondo @muneondo]) [https://twitter.com/muneondo/status/154176395826835456 on Twitter]. ([https://archive.vn/xccqr archive])</ref>

===Origin===
Raikou is partially based on a {{wp|tiger}}. <ref name="Saitō"/> Raikou's long upper fangs bear a resemblance to those of a {{wp|smilodon|saber-toothed tiger}}. Raikou and its {{t|Electric}} typing represent the lightning that struck the [[Burned Tower|Brass Tower]] according to its legend; while {{p|Entei}} represents the fire that burned it, and {{p|Suicune}} represents the rain that put it out.

One of the earlier designs for Raikou having a drum on its back may hint at it also being based on {{wp|Raijin}}— a Japanese god of lightning and thunder, depicted as carrying ''taiko'' drums to create the sound of thunder. Raijin is often given {{wp|oni}} features, a supernatural creature often associated with tiger pelts. It may have also been inspired by ''{{wp|raijū}}'', a lightning creature that can take the form of various animals and is said to be Raijin's companion. 

The flowing purple cloud on Raikou's back seems to be based on a dark {{wp|nimbostratus cloud}} or {{wp|cumulonimbus cloud}}, the latter being associated with thunderstorms. This detail may also hint at Raikou being based on the ''{{wp|Nue}}'', a chimeric creature depicted with the limbs (and sometimes the body) of a tiger and accompanied by black clouds that it can shapeshift into. 

====Name origin====
Raikou may be derived from 雷 ''rai'' (thunder) or 雷光 ''raikō'' (lightning) and 公 ''kō'' (lord/duke) or 皇 ''kō'' (emperor), where the former forms a reference to 雷公 ''{{wp|Leigong|Léigōng}}'' (Thunder Duke, god of thunder in Chinese mythology).
