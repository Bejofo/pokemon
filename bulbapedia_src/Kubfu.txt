'''Kubfu''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ダクマ''' ''Dakuma'') is a {{type|Fighting}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced during [[Generation VIII]], in [[The Isle of Armor]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Urshifu}} when shown the scroll in one of the [[Towers of Two Fists]] or when exposed to the [[Scroll of Darkness]] or the [[Scroll of Waters]]. The {{fd|Urshifu|form}} it evolves into depends on how it evolves.
* Kubfu evolves into '''Single Strike Style''' Urshifu upon observing the scroll in the [[Tower of Darkness]] or when exposed to the [[Scroll of Darkness]].
* Kubfu evolves into '''Rapid Strike Style''' Urshifu upon observing the scroll in the [[Tower of Waters]] or when exposed to the [[Scroll of Waters]].

(Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for more details.)

==Biology==
Kubfu is a small, bearlike {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. Its body is primarily dark gray, with a yellow snout and white patches of fur on its head and chest. The patch of fur on its forehead partially covers its black eyes, and has two black downturned eyebrows on top. Additionally, there are two white ribbons of fur located behind its head. Kubfu builds up power and fighting spirit by pulling on these ribbons. Its nose is black and it has a perpetual frown. It has black claws and toes, the latter of which are shaped like triangles. Its tail has a black, spiky appearance.

Kubfu works hard to train both body and mind, even using its defeats as a motivation to grow even stronger. It has a unique organ that allows it to create "{{t|fighting}} energy" in its lower abdomen through special breathing techniques and intense focusing. Wild Kubfu live in mountainous areas far away from the [[Galar]] [[region]], although they lived in the region at some point. According to historical texts, Kubfu used to travel to uncharted lands with people as they went to trade or explore. Records suggest that the Kubfu living in faraway mountains in the present day, may have descended from the Kubfu that became naturalized in the distant lands they visited in the past<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/expansionpass/pokemon/kubfu/ Kubfu | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref>. It has been referred to as the "'''secret armor'''" of the [[Isle of Armor]]'s [[Master Dojo]], being gifted by [[Mustard]] to the one who pass the dojo's three trials. The [[Signature move|move]] it masters by reading one of the [[Scroll of Darkness|special]] [[Scroll of Waters|scrolls]] in one of the [[Towers of Two Fists]] will determine which [[List of Pokémon with form differences#Urshifu|fighting style]] it takes after evolving. While it can be timid, it can become more brave and confident once trained up. Kubfu loves [[Kubfu Treat]]s made by [[Snacksworth]], who once encountered and trained with it in the past.

===Evolution===
Kubfu evolves into {{p|Urshifu}}.

===Evolution data===
In [[Generation VIII]], the form of {{p|Urshifu}} that Kubfu [[Evolution|evolves]] into is dependent on which of the [[Towers of Two Fists]] it evolved at, with it evolving into Single Strike Style at the [[Tower of Darkness]] or Rapid Strike Style at the [[Tower of Waters]]. In [[Generation IX]], Kubfu evolves into Single Strike Style when exposed to the [[Scroll of Darkness]] or Rapid Strike Style when exposed to the [[Scroll of Waters]].

Note that in order to complete the Isle of Armor Pokédex in [[Pokémon HOME]], it's recommended to deposit Kubfu before evolving it, as only one can be obtained per game, and Kubfu or Urshifu cannot breed.

Kubfu first appeared in ''[[PASS32|Boom!! Reunion in a New Land]]''. It was the "secret armor" of the [[Master Dojo]], and was given to Trainers who complete the dojo's three trials. Despite this, Mustard decided to let it see the world alongside {{Casey}}, but she rejected the offer as she already had a full team. Mustard then allowed it to walk with {{Henry}} instead. Once Kubfu had finished its {{pkmn|training}} and evolved into {{p|Urshifu}}, it officially joined Henry's team.

* Kubfu had {{a|No Guard}} coded as its [[Hidden Ability]] in {{g|Scarlet and Violet}} versions 1.0.0-1.1.0; however, it was removed in version 1.2.0. Kubfu was never legally obtainable during this period as the games had not yet received {{g|HOME}} support.
* Kubfu is the only Pokémon in the [[Core series|core series]] that evolves through the use of a [[Key Item]].

===Origin===
Kubfu may be based on a {{wp|bear}} cub and a {{wp|Chinese martial arts|kung fu}} student wearing a {{wp|headband}}. Its alternative name "secret armor" may be inspired by the magical armor owned by {{wp|King Arthur}} in ''{{wp|Historia Regum Britanniae}}'' or the ''{{wp|Roman de Brut}}''.

====Name origin====
Kubfu may be a combination of ''cub'' and ''kung fu''.

Dakuma may be a combination of 打 ''da'' (hit), 熊 ''kuma'' (bear), and 琢磨 ''takuma'' (cultivation of skill).
