'''Graveler''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ゴローン''' ''Golone'') is a dual-type {{2t|Rock|Ground}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Geodude}} starting at [[level]] 25 and evolves into {{p|Golem}} when [[Trade Evolution|traded]] or when exposed to a [[Linking Cord]].

In [[Alola]], Graveler has a dual-type {{2t|Rock|Electric}} [[regional form]]. It evolves from {{rf|Alolan}} Geodude starting at level 25 and evolves into Alolan Golem when traded. These Graveler can also be found in [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]]. 

(Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for more details.)

==Biology==
Graveler is a bipedal, {{wp|boulder}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. Its round body is covered with small bumps and it has a rocky crest above its small eyes and mouth. It has four arms, each with a three-fingered hand. Its second pair of arms is typically kept tucked against its chest. It was shown in [[Pokémon Snap]] that, despite having legs, it can revert to a legless form. This grants it the ability to float.

Graveler's preferred locomotion is rolling, specifically, because it is a slow walker. It often rolls down mountain paths at high speeds exceeding 60 mph, crushing objects in the way and stopping by running into huge rocks should it build up too much speed. However, it will explode if it rolls into a river instead. Graveler is known to be generally free and uncaring, not minding if pieces of itself break off, as it can restore itself over time. Graveler climbs a mountain from base to summit, feasting on rocks all the while. Graveler's favorite rock to eat is moss-covered rocks. It regularly consumes tons of moss-covered rocks and makes loud noises while eating. Upon reaching the peak, it rolls down to the bottom. Graveler live in horizontal holes that they gouge out in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Mountain Pokémon|sheer cliff faces}}, and they are capable of withstanding volcanic temperatures. As mentioned in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Graveler is known to rock back and forth while sleeping.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref> It is believed that Graveler is dreaming about rolling down hilly paths.

===Forms===
Graveler has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Alolan}} Graveler.

In the [[Alola]] region, Graveler looks similar to its regular counterpart, but with a silvery sheen. It lacks defined digits on its upper limbs and has two toes on each foot rather than three. There are several small, yellowish crystals scattered across its body and iron sand attracted by magnetism. This black sand creates crystal-like formations above its eyes, across the tops of the upper pair of arms, and on the sides of its face. 

Alolan Graveler has a very quick-tempered personality. Alolan Graveler feeds on {{wp|dravite}}, which creates the yellow crystals on its body and grants it electrical abilities. It often fights with others over food, and when two smash together, it creates a flash of light and a booming sound; for this reason, people refer to it as "the fireworks of the earth".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170912111612/http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/alolan-graveler/ | Alolan Graveler (Archived)]</ref> Similar to its Kantonian counterpart, Alolan Graveler rolls down mountain paths; however, instead of flattening obstacles as it rolls, it sends them flying by zapping them with electricity. They can also be found in the [[Canyon Biome]] of [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]], where Alola's island life is simulated.

Alolan Graveler and its evolutionary relatives are the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Galvanize}} as an [[Ability]].

===Evolution===
Graveler evolves from {{p|Geodude}} and evolves into {{p|Golem}}.

{{rf|Alolan}} Graveler has a dual-type {{2t|Rock|Electric}} [[regional form]]. It evolves from Alolan Geodude and evolves into Alolan Golem.

==Trivia==
* Graveler's {{v2|Crystal}} sprite is different from that of {{2v2|Gold|Silver}}, making it one of few Pokémon to have three distinctly different sprites in [[Generation II]].
* Graveler's {{2v2|Red|Blue}} sprite shows an incorrect number of limbs; only four are visible. This was corrected in {{game|Yellow}}.
** [[Mato]]'s rendition of the Pokémon in [[Pokémon Adventures]] also depicts {{adv|Yellow}}'s Graveler with four limbs, possibly for this reason. All other Graveler that have since appeared in Pokémon Adventures have shown the right amount.
* Graveler is the only Pokémon unavailable for use in the [[Pika Cup]] who can evolve, despite the fact that {{p|Golem}} is available.
* Graveler is very similar to {{p|Boldore}}. Both are {{type|Rock}} Pokémon introduced in an odd-numbered [[generation]] with a base stat total of 390, have {{a|Sturdy}} as one of their {{Abilities}}, evolve at level 25, and can evolve again by [[Trade|trading]].
* Graveler's evolutionary line is the only three-stage evolutionary line in which all members have a [[regional form]].
* Alolan Graveler and its evolutionary relatives were designed by [[Hitoshi Ariga]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/ariga_megamix/status/804500572967555072 Tweet by ありがひとし/ArigaHitoshi (@ariga_megamix).] Posted on December 2, 2016.</ref>
* {{p|Burmy}}, {{p|Wormadam}}, {{p|Mothim}}, {{p|Geodude}}, Graveler and {{p|Golem}} are the only Pokémon in all five [[List of Pokémon by Hisui Pokédex number|Hisui Pokédex]] sublistings.
* In [[Generation IX]], Kantonian Graveler cannot learn {{m|Gyro Ball}} via [[TM]], while its evolutionary relatives can.

===Origin===
Graveler appears to be based on a living {{wp|boulder}}, and thus it may be based on an earth {{wp|elemental}} creature like {{wp|golem}}. Its four arms may be based on Hindu gods such as {{wp|Shiva}} or {{wp|Vishnu}}. It could also have been inspired by the ''tsuchikorobi'', a Japanese {{wp|yōkai}} known as the "tumbling monster", for its habit of rolling over travelers and crushing them, as Graveler does.

Alolan Graveler seems to have dark structures made of {{wp|Piezoelectricity#Materials|piezoelectric crystals}} or {{wp|magnetite}}, a subset of iron ore known for its black crystalline appearance and magnetic properties. This iron ore takes shape of Graveler's {{wp|eyebrow}}s. The golden gems may be also inspired by piezoelectric materials or by {{wp|amber}} and its electrostatic characteristics. This could possibly be an allusion to {{lang|grc|ἤλεκτρον}} ''ēlektron'' (Ancient Greek for amber), from which words like ''electric'', ''electrical'', ''electricity'' derive.

====Name origin====
Graveler may be a combination of ''{{wp|gravel}}'' and ''traveler''.

Golone may be a combination of ゴロンゴロン ''goron-goron'' (onomatopoeia of rolling rocks) and ''stone''.
