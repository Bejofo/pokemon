'''Wishiwashi''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ヨワシ''' ''Yowashi'') is a {{type|Water}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation VII]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Wishiwashi can change [[#Form data|forms]] with its {{a|Schooling}} [[Ability]] if it has reached [[level]] 20. When Wishiwashi enters a {{pkmn|battle}} or ends a turn with its [[HP]] above 25%, it changes from '''Solo Form''' to '''School Form'''. School Form Wishiwashi will revert to Solo Form Wishiwashi if its HP is below 25%.

==Biology==
Wishiwashi is a fishlike {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. It has two different forms depending on the situation.

In its Solo Form, Wishiwashi resembles a small fish. It has large, light blue eyes with irises that resemble puddles of water and dark blue eyelids. The head and tail are both white. There is a line of white teardrop-shapes on each side of its body with the teardrop nearest the head being slightly larger. The top half of its body is dark blue and has a short, rounded dorsal fin. The lower half of its body is gray with two pectoral fins. This tiny Pokémon is both the [[List of Pokémon by height|shortest]] and [[List of Pokémon by weight|lightest]] {{type|Water}}.

An individual Wishiwashi is small, weak, and notably tasty. As a result Wishiwashi has numerous natural predators, including [[human]]s,  {{p|Dewgong}}, {{p|Wailmer}}, {{p|Wailord}}, {{p|Wingull}}, and {{p|Pelipper}}. While Wishiwashi are known to move in schools, they're more often seen alone. Wishiwashi also gather when confronting opponents. It can call on its friends by shining its eyes seen as an SOS signal almost 25 miles (40 kilometers) away.<ref>[http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/wishiwashi-solo-form/ Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Solo Wishiwashi]</ref><ref>[http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/wishiwashi-school-form/ Pokémon Sun and Moon site | School Wishiwashi]</ref> 

Wishiwashi is the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Schooling}} as an [[Ability]].

===Forms===
Wishiwashi has two interchangeable forms: Solo Form and School Form.

In its School Form, Wishiwashi resembles a large fish roughly formed from various smaller fish with glowing eyes. Starting with its head, its body is divided into four bands that each become a slightly darker shade of blue. A ring of bright blue glowing spots lines the front edge of the two middle bands. The centers of its "eyes" are formed by a single white fish with glowing eyes for pupils. Surrounding the white fish is a dark blue recess, and at the rear edge of the "eye" is a raised white area for eyelids. Above each eye is a single, dark blue fish shape. Wishiwashi's mouth gapes wide open, apparently unable to close fully due to gaps on each side. Its lips in the front are lined with glowing spots, and many more spots dot the inside of its mouth.

On each side of the School Form's body, in the second band, there is a pair of dark blue fish-shaped recesses. Wishiwashi can fire fish-shaped torpedoes from this area. Its pectoral fins are the same color as its head and have three finger-like projections. There are glowing spots at the base of each "finger" and at the base of the fins themselves. On top of its head are two short projections shaped like fishtails, one behind the other. Additionally, Wishiwashi has a large dorsal fin that is darker around the base and has two glowing spots at the tip. The third section of its body has a ring of four spike-like fins around it. Three spikes encircle the tip of its tail, each with two glowing dots at the base. Dark fish shapes float freely a short distance from the end of each spike, all with two more dots on them. Finally, the tip of its tail is a rounded teardrop shape with a single dot on each side.

The people of Alola and Galar also fear Wishiwashi and call it the "demon of the sea" due to its School Form.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170919135108mp_/http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/wishiwashi-school-form/ | WishiWashi School Form (Archived)]</ref> Even the fearsome {{p|Gyarados}} and Wailord are known to flee from it when it enters School Form. Wishiwashi assumes this form whenever a Wishiwashi is in danger or is bullied. Wishiwashi can concentrate their powers when assembled. The School Form's {{m|Water Gun}} is said to be more powerful than a {{m|Hydro Pump}} move. Should it get wounded in School Form, Wishiwashi will split into a regular school before fleeing.

A special school of Wishiwashi in [[Alola]] acts as the [[Totem Pokémon]] for [[Lana]]'s {{DL|Island challenge|trial}} in [[Brooklet Hill]]. These Wishiwashi possess [[Z-Power]], an energy that originates from [[Ultra Wormhole]]s and takes the form of a golden, flaring aura. The reward for defeating Totem Wishiwashi and completing the trial is a [[Waterium Z]].

===NPC appearances===
* [[Pokémon: Magikarp Jump]]: Silhouettes of schools of Wishiwashi may randomly appear in the background of the pond.
* [[New Pokémon Snap]]: A school of Wishiwashi are [[Illumina phenomenon|Illumina Pokémon]], a group of Pokémon who saved the region from a meteorite 2000 years ago. Unlike the other Illumina Pokémon, the individual Wishiwashi themselves do not possess a pattern while under the effects of the Illumina phenomenon; instead, a pattern is seen when they are under the effects of it while in School Form. They reside in the {{DL|Lental Seafloor|Maricopia Islands Illumina Spot}}.

===Form data===
Wishiwashi has two interchangeable forms: Solo Form and School Form. It can change between them using its {{a|Schooling}} [[Ability]] if it is at least [[level]] 20. Outside of {{pkmn|battle}}, Wishiwashi is always in its Solo Form.

Wishiwashi starts battles in its Solo Form. If it is at least level 20 and has above 25% of its maximum {{stat|HP}} remaining when it enters battle, it will change into its School Form. If its remaining HP is at or below 25% of its maximum HP at the end of a turn, it will revert back to Solo Form; however, if it subsequently has above 25% of its maximum HP remaining at the end of a turn, it will change back into School Form. If it is switched out while in School Form, it will revert to its Solo Form.

Wishiwashi's two forms have different [[base stats]], with School Form having significantly higher {{stat|Attack}}, {{stat|Defense}}, {{stat|Special Attack}}, and {{stat|Special Defense}}, but lower {{stat|Speed}} and identical {{stat|HP}}. The two forms also have different [[Cry|cries]].

==Trivia==
* Of all Pokémon with multiple [[form]]s, Wishiwashi's base stat total undergoes by far the most drastic change.
** Solo Form Wishiwashi has the lowest base stat total of all Pokémon at only 175.
** School Form Wishiwashi is the [[List of Pokémon with unique base stat totals|only Pokémon]] with a base stat total of 620.
* Wishiwashi is the only [[Totem Pokémon]] to not be larger than its usual size. As such, it is also the only one that cannot be obtained as a Totem-sized Pokémon in [[Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon]].
* By comparing the weight of both forms of Wishiwashi, we can assume that School Form Wishiwashi contains exactly 262 Solo Form Wishiwashi.

===Origin===
Wishiwashi's Solo Form bears a resemblance to {{wp|South American pilchard|Pacific sardines}}. Its eyes' ability to light up may be derived from {{wp|Anomalopidae|flashlight fish}}. Its bioluminescence, great abundance, and overall shape may also reference the {{wp|lanternfish}}. Its School Form bears some resemblance to a submarine and the extinct {{wp|Dunkleosteus|Dunkleosteus}}.

====Name origin====
Wishiwashi may be a combination of ''wishy-washy'', describing the weak state of its Solo Form; ''wash'', in reference to its {{t|Water}} type; and 鰯 ''iwashi'' (Japanese for sardine).

Yowashi may be a combination of 弱し ''yowashi'' (weak; the classical Japanese form of 弱い ''yowai'') or 弱々しい ''yowayowashii'' (frail) and 鰯 ''iwashi'' (sardine).
