'''Lilligant''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ドレディア''' '' Dredear'') is a {{type|Grass}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation V]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s from {{p|Petilil}} when exposed to a [[Sun Stone]].

In [[Hisui]], Lilligant has a dual-type {{2t|Grass|Fighting}} [[regional form]]. It evolves from Petilil when exposed to a Sun Stone. All Petilil in Hisui will evolve into this form regardless of their origin.

==Biology==
Lilligant is a humanoid {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with plant characteristics. It dons a scarlet flower with white-spotted petals upon its head; said flower has golden filaments with red anther, resembling a crown. It possesses dark green, linear leaves under the flower, and light green, linear leaves underneath the darker leaves. One of the light green leaves, on the back of its head, is about as long as its body and resembles hair. Two light green leaves loosely hang down from its head. Its head and abdomen are white and its eyes, which resemble seeds, are a light shade of scarlet. It has dark green, linear leaves for arms, and a golden {{wp|sepal}} under its neck. It wears a large, light green, {{wp|tulip}} shaped collection of leaves, resembling a dress. There are two long, dark green, linear leaves coming from its back to around the bottom of its "dress". It also possesses another golden, sepal-shaped extension underneath its "dress", resembling feet.

Though Lilligant is popular with celebrities, veteran Trainers and first-rate gardeners alike have struggled to coax the flower on Lilligant's head into blooming. The flowers bloomed by Lilligant in the wild are also said to be the most beautiful despite all these efforts. Once it blooms, it will wilt if Lilligant is then neglected or when it finds a male partner. The flower emits a sweet-smelling aroma, and it is believed to have a relaxing effect on those exposed to the scent. The flower's fragrance differs slightly depending on the soil it was cultivated in. The oil made by Lilligant's flowers has a sublime scent and is very expensive to buy. It is a rare Pokémon that lives in forests. Lilligant is a female-only species with no male counterpart.

===Forms===
Lilligant has an ancient [[regional form]]: Hisuian Lilligant.

In [[Hisui]], Lilligant takes on a drastically different look. Hisuian Lilligant has a more lithe build. Its head and torso are white and its wide hips are covered in light green leaves, with two small slightly darker leaves coming out from either side. On the left side of its head is a six-petaled pink flower with short filaments jutting out from it, and dark green leaves underneath it. The scent released from this flower causes anyone nearby to experience a heartened feeling. Its eyes are light pink and purple. The leaves on its head that resemble hair are much shorter than on Unovan Lilligant. The sepal around its neck is also smaller. Hisuian Lilligant's arms are green, with its forearms being a lighter green. They are much longer and thinner than those of Unovan Lilligant. It also has long, powerful legs, and they are white with a dark pink gradient at the calves. Its feet are golden and cover part of its legs, and they seem to resemble {{wp|dance shoe}}s or {{wp|snow boot}}s.

Hisuian Lilligant is suspected to have its legs developed as a result of living in the snowy mountains of [[Hisui]]; they allow it to jump very high and gracefully. The scent in its flower crown heartens those in proximity. Its attacks take form of ballet-like moves, almost like it's dancing during battle.

A special Hisuian Lilligant is worshiped in [[Hisui]] due to her being descended from one of the 10 ancient Pokémon who received a blessing from Arceus. In particular, she is one of the [[Noble Pokémon]] who resides in [[Crimson Mirelands]], watched over by the [[warden]] [[Arezu]].

Hisuian Lilligant is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Victory Dance}}.

===Evolution===
Lilligant evolves from {{p|Petilil}}.

In [[Hisui]], Lilligant has a [[regional form]] that evolves from Petilil.

==Trivia==
* Lilligant has the highest base Speed increase from evolving out of all {{T|Grass}} type Pokémon.
* Unovan Lilligant shares its {{pkmn|category|category}} with {{p|Gossifleur}}. They are both known as the Flowering Pokémon.
* Unovan Lilligant and its pre-Evolution were designed by [[Atsuko Nishida]].<ref name=CFPPage2>[https://funs-project.com/poplab/007/index_2.html Fun's Project interview with Atsuko Nishida (Page 2)]</ref><ref name=ND204>''Nintendo Dream'' Vol. 204, April 2011 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110704155314/http://shellspider.blog101.fc2.com/blog-entry-502.html Shellspider's blog (Japanese)], [http://lavacutcontent.com/ken-sugimori-nintendo-dream-2/ Translation by Dr. Lava])</ref>
* According to [[Ken Sugimori]], {{p|Petilil}} and Lilligant were going to have a third evolutionary member.<ref name=ND204/>
* Lilligant and {{p|Whimsicott}} can be seen as counterparts. They share a base stat total of 480, are part of two-stage evolutionary lines, and evolve using a [[Sun Stone]]. Additionally, Lilligant is exclusive to {{game|Black and White|s|Pokémon White}}, {{game3|Black and White|White 2|s 2}}, {{pkmn|Sun and Moon|Moon}}, and {{pkmn|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|Ultra Moon}}, while Whimsicott is exclusive to Pokémon Black, Black 2, Sun, and Ultra Sun.
* Lilligant is the only Pokémon with {{a|Own Tempo}} to naturally learn {{m|Petal Dance}}, and such is the only Pokémon who can use this move without getting {{status|confused}} without copying the move from another Pokémon.

===Origin===
Lilligant is based on a {{wp|lily}}. Atsuko Nishida mentioned in an interview that she came up with Lilligant while looking at lilies in her home.<ref name=CFPPage2/> Furthermore, Lilligant's design was intended to give the impression of an "extravagant princess".<ref name=ND204/> Its crown and dress may be derived from {{wp|1750–1775 in Western fashion#Women's fashion|Western high-class women's fashion during 1750–1775}}. It could also be based on a ballroom dancer since its lower body resembles a {{wp|ball gown}}, and several of the moves that it learns by leveling up are dance moves.

The Hisuian form of Lilligant may be inspired by the fact that ''{{wp|Allium}}'' used to be placed in {{wp|Liliaceae}} or the lily family. Its leaf-shaped arms and the white to pink gradient on its legs may be based on ''{{wp|Allium victorialis}}'' (or specifically ''{{wp|Allium ochotense|A. ochotense}}'' according to some authorities), a wild onion of ethnobotanical importance to the {{wp|Ainu people}}. The plant is usually served with the bulb of ''{{wp|Cardiocrinum cordatum}}'', a floral plant in the lily family, in Ainu cuisine and folk medicine. Hisuian Lilligant's appearance and movements may be based on a {{wp|ballerina}}, a {{wp|rhythmic gymnastics|rhythmic gymnast}}, or a {{wp|figure skating|figure skater}}, while its [[signature move]] {{m|Victory Dance}} could also be a wordplay on ''victorialis'' ({{wp|New Latin}} for victorious).

====Name origin====
Lilligant may be a combination of ''lily'' and ''elegant''.

Dredear may be a combination of ''dress'', ''dear'', ''lady'', and ''{{wp|Dianthus}}''.
