'''Murkrow''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ヤミカラス''' ''Yamikarasu'') is a dual-type {{2t|Dark|Flying}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation II]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s into {{p|Honchkrow}} when exposed to a [[Dusk Stone]].

==Biology==
Murkrow is an {{wp|Aves|avian}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with black feathers. Its crooked, yellow beak and the three, feathery tufts on its head resemble a witch's nose and hat respectively. The feathery crest is smaller on the female than on the male. It has semi-circular, red eyes with white sclerae and pupils and a spiky collar of feathers around its neck. The shaggy feathers on its tail resemble the end of a broom, and there is a thin, red band at the base of the tail. Its yellow feet have four toes, three facing forward and one backward.

Murkrow awakens at dusk and moves during the night. It has a fondness for anything sparkly, and it will go as far as fighting with other Pokémon, such as {{p|Meowth}} or {{p|Gabite}}, in order to gain their stashes. However, it is also known to give these sparkly objects to [[Trainer]]s that it is fond of. Whenever it is chased, it loses the attacker by leading it down dark mountain trails, and sometimes it does this to travelers as a mean-spirited prank. Its thieving and nocturnal nature has led it to become representative of misfortune. It was believed that saying, "Workrum, Workrum—bad luck, don't come," would serve as a protective incantation to drive away bad luck caused by seeing a Murkrow. It is possible to train a Murkrow to repeat words, [[Pokémon Gold and Silver Versions|as seen]] under [[Team Rocket]]'s ownership. Murkrow usually live in flocks (referred to as "murders") amongst {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Forest Pokémon|forests and swamps}}. Murkrow may also act as a servant of {{p|Honchkrow}}; with groups of at least 100 flying in at Honchkrow's call. There is a saying for Murkrow that goes, "Get home before the Murkrow fly." As mentioned in [[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]], Murkrow has been seen falling asleep before it can hide all of its shiny objects. It is believed the reason is due to Murkrow becoming exhausted from searching and hiding said objects. Murkrow has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: ''Preening Sleep'', ''Big-Yawn Sleep'', ''Gem-Gathering Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''.


===Evolution===
Murkrow evolves into {{p|Honchkrow}}.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Murkrow (TCG)}}

==In the TFG==
One Murkrow figure has been released.
* {{TFG|Next Quest}}: {{TFG ID|Next Quest|Murkrow|12}}

==Trivia==
* Murkrow shares its {{pkmn|category}} name with {{p|Sableye}}. They are both known as the Darkness Pokémon.
* Despite being a [[Generation II]] Pokémon, it was actually only available in [[Kanto]] in {{game2|Gold|Silver|Crystal}}. The same is true for {{p|Slugma}} and {{p|Houndour}}. Murkrow and Houndour can be obtained in [[Johto]] via the {{safari|Johto}} in {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}}.
* Murkrow can be seen as a parallel to {{p|Misdreavus}}. Both are {{cat|Generation II Pokémon}} that [[Evolution|evolve]] when exposed to a [[Dusk Stone]] and have evolved forms that were introduced in [[Generation IV]]. Murkrow is exclusive to {{game3|FireRed and LeafGreen|Pokémon FireRed|s}}, {{game3|Diamond and Pearl|Diamond|s}}, {{game3|Black and White|Black|s}}, and {{pkmn|Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl|Brilliant Diamond}}, while Misdreavus is exclusive to LeafGreen, Pearl, White, and Shining Pearl.
* Murkrow is the only Pokémon that evolves with a Dusk Stone that is not a {{type|Ghost}}.
* Murkrow is the [[List of Pokémon by weight|lightest]] {{type|Dark}} Pokémon.
**Among all Pokémon that are the lightest of their respective types, Murkrow is the heaviest.
* In the [[List of Pokémon by National Pokédex number|National Pokédex]], Murkrow is listed before Misdreavus, but Murkrow's Evolution, {{p|Honchkrow}}, is listed after Misdreavus's Evolution, {{p|Mismagius}}.
* In {{g|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon}}, Murkrow is programmed to be able to learn {{m|Punishment}} through {{pkmn|breeding}}, but no other Pokémon in the {{egg2|Flying}} can pass down Punishment as an [[Egg Move]] in those games. {{p|Vullaby}} and {{p|Mandibuzz}} are the only Flying Egg Group Pokémon that can learn Punishment, but they cannot pass down the move due to being female-only species.

===Origin===
Murkrow seems to be based on a {{wp|crow}}, more specifically the {{wp|carrion crow}}. Its crest can be taken to resemble a pointed hat, its beak a hooked nose, and its tail the bristles of a broom, giving it a resemblance to a {{wp|Witchcraft|witch}} in flight. It may also be inspired by witches' {{wp|familiar}}s, which often can be crows or ravens. Its crest also resembles that of the {{wp|black hawk-eagle}}. In regards to its [[Generation IV]] [[Evolution]], it can also be taken to resemble a gang member under a head Honchkrow. Its ability to mimic voices is referencing crows' and ravens' ability to imitate other sounds.

====Name origin====
Murkrow may be a combination of ''murky'' or ''murder'' (a group of crows) and ''{{wp|crow}}''.

Yamikarasu may be a combination of 闇 ''yami'' (darkness) and 烏 ''karasu'' (crow).
