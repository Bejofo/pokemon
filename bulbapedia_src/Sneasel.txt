'''Sneasel''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ニューラ''' ''Nyula'') is a dual-type {{2t|Dark|Ice}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation II]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s into {{p|Weavile}} when [[level]]ed up while holding a [[Razor Claw]] during the [[Time-based Evolution|night]].

In [[Hisui]], Sneasel has a dual-type {{2t|Fighting|Poison}} [[regional form]]. It evolves into {{p|Sneasler}} when [[level]]ed up while holding a Razor Claw during the day.

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for more details.)

==Biology==
Sneasel is a bipedal {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that resembles both a cat and a weasel. It is primarily bluish-black with three bright red feathers for its tail and a single one on its left ear. The ear feather is shorter on the female than on the male. The other ear is short and pointed, and it has narrow red eyes. On its forehead and chest are oval, yellow gem-like protrusions. It has red eyes with black eyelash-like markings on the edges. It has long limbs with two large, white retractable claws on its hands and feet. It is perfectly capable of using its claws to do substantial damage. Its claws are also used for climbing trees in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Forest Pokémon|boreal or sub-alpine forests}} where it lives. It can also bring out its claws to startle foes that attacked it.

Sneasel is a smart, sneaky, and notoriously vicious Pokémon, and blends well into the night in order to ambush their prey. Sneasel feeds on {{pkmn|Eggs}}, such as those of {{p|Pidgey}}, that it steals from unattended nests. It uses its claws to poke a hole in the Egg before slurping the contents out. It has been known to form pairs to hunt: one Sneasel will lure the parents away from their nest, while the other steals their Eggs. Although the Sneasel pair works together, they will also fight over their hunt among themselves. As a result of its Egg-based diet, Sneasel are despised by [[Pokémon Breeder (Trainer class)|Breeders]] to the point where they try to drive away or eradicate the former. Sneasel also preys on {{rf|Alolan}} {{p|Sandshrew}}, but the Sandshrew's skin is so hard that it can cause Sneasel's claws to snap off. As mentioned in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Sneasel has been observed sleeping peacefully on very rare occasions despite its savage personality. Additionally, it has been seen sleeping with its belly out and languidly washing its face.

Prior to [[Generation IV]], {{m|Beat Up}} was its [[signature move]], but other Pokémon could still inherit it via {{pkmn|breeding}}.

===Forms===
Sneasel has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Hisuian}} Sneasel.

In [[Hisui]], Sneasel has a similar appearance to its Johtonian counterpart. It has a white body with purple colorations on its face, chest, shoulders, and forelimbs. The feathers on its tail and ear are light purple; like Johtonian Sneasel, the ear feather is shorter on the female than on the male. It has rounder eyes than its Johtonian form, although it shares the latter's gem-like protrusions, as well as the large claws on its hands and feet. The claws are tipped with poison, and are purple on its forelimbs and white on its feet.

Hisuian Sneasel's sturdy and curved claws allow it to climb and travel through the walls of precipitous cliffs where it lives. The venom from the tips of its claws is capable of invading the nervous system of any prey it scratches. It has been observed that Hisuian Sneasel lacks the spitefulness of its Johtonian counterpart, and it has been theorized that differences in their environments account for the differing personalities. As a result, Hisuian Sneasel evolves into {{p|Sneasler}} instead of {{p|Weavile}}.

===Evolution===
Sneasel evolves into {{p|Weavile}}.

{{rf|Hisuian}} Sneasel evolves into {{p|Sneasler}}.

==Trivia==
[[File:Cats by Kino Takahashi.png|right|thumb|Sneasel in Galarian Meowth merchandise by [[Kino Takahashi]].]]
* Sneasel is one of fourteen {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that one could collect [[foreign Pokédex entries]] for in {{game|Diamond and Pearl|s}}.
* Sneasel can be seen as a counterpart to {{p|Gligar}}. Both of them have two [[type]]s which cause them to have a 4× [[Type#Type effectiveness|weakness]] to another type, have the same [[base stat]] total, evolve into Pokémon that were introduced in [[Generation IV]] ({{p|Weavile}} and {{p|Gliscor}}), and do so by leveling up at night while holding an [[Evolution item]] whose name includes the word ''razor'' ([[Razor Claw]] and [[Razor Fang]]). Additionally, both are available as [[Shadow Pokémon]] in [[Pokémon Colosseum]], and found in [[The Under Subway]].
* Sneasel has the highest base {{stat|Speed}} stat of all Pokémon that are capable of evolving.
* Despite Sneasel being possibly based on the ''kamaitachi'', which has the same Japanese name as {{m|Razor Wind}}, Sneasel cannot learn this move.
* Sneasel is the only Pokémon to have a [[gender difference]] in both its standard form and [[regional form]].
** Furthermore, Hisuan Sneasel is the only regional form to have gender differences.
* Sneasel is the only dual-type Pokémon to have a dual-type regional form that doesn't share either of its types.
* Sneasel is the only Pokémon with a Hisuian form to have its original form available in any capacity in [[Pokémon Legends: Arceus]].
* {{rf|Hisuian}} Sneasel and {{p|Sneasler|its Evolution}} were designed by [[Hitoshi Ariga]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/ariga_megamix/status/1493600999038021632 Tweet by ありがひとし/ArigaHitoshi (@ariga_megamix).] Posted on February 16, 2022.</ref>
* In [[Pokémon Legends: Arceus]]'s internal code, Hisuian Sneasel's Hidden Ability is {{a|Poison Touch}} instead of {{a|Pickpocket}}.
* Sneasel has been depicted with three variants in color. In {{game|Gold and Silver|s}}, Sneasel had a bronze coloration while its tail feathers were a dark cyan; while in [[Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness]], Sneasel had a light purple body. The third color variant is its current bluish black color which has been consistently depicted in the main series games from {{game|Crystal}} onwards.
* Johtonian Sneasel and its evolved form, Weavile, are the only {{DL|List of Pokémon by color|black}} {{type|Ice}} Pokémon.

===Origin===
Sneasel's design appears to be based on a cross between a {{wp|kamaitachi}} and a {{wp|cat}}. More specifically, its feline aspect may have been inspired by {{wp|cat-sìth}}, black cat fae often depicted in {{wp|swashbuckler|swashbuckling}} {{wp|Puss in Boots}} fashion in Japanese media.

Hisuian Sneasel might be based on versions of the ''kamaitachi'' that are said to inflict diseases on those who encounter it instead of cuts, which could explain its Poison type. One of these version is called ''yama-misaki'', spirits of people who had accidental deaths that can be found deep into the mountains and in some versions are associated with cliffs, reflecting Hisuian Sneasel's usual habitat.

====Name origin====
Sneasel may be a combination of ''sneaky'' and ''weasel''. It may also derive from ''sneeze'', an action associated with having a cold or being cold, or ''sneesl'' (Scots for ''to begin to rain or snow''), both in reference to its Ice type.

Nyula may be a combination of にゅー ''nyu'' (cat's purr), 鼬 ''yū'' (alternate reading of ''itachi'', weasel), and 拉 ''ra'' (to carry off). It may also involve 野良 ''nora'' (stray or feral).
