'''Fletchling''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ヤヤコマ''' ''Yayakoma'') is a dual-type {{2t|Normal|Flying}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation VI]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Fletchinder}} starting at [[level]] 17, which evolves into {{p|Talonflame}} starting at level 35.

==Biology==
Fletchling is a small, avian {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} similar in appearance to a {{wp|Japanese robin|robin}}. It has a reddish-orange head with a triangular yellow mark on the back of each eye. Its body and wings are gray, and there are white tips on the wings. It has a long, black tail with a white V-shaped marking near the tip. The tail ends in two points and has two feathers sticking out at the base, resembling the {{wp|fletching}} on the end of an arrow. Its legs, small beak, and eyes are black. The legs are thin and spindly, with two toes facing forward and one facing backward on each foot.

Fletchling is said to be very friendly and is well known for its beautiful songs, which are in fact sounds of warning. It communicates by using chirps and moving its tailfeathers to signal others of its kind. In spite of its typically peaceful disposition, it is relentless in battle and very territorial, attacking perceived threats mercilessly. Its body is warm and doubles in temperature when startled or excited. This increase in temperature spikes hormone production in its body. It can burn someone if they touch it with their bare hands. Fletchling live in both rural and urban areas, and once had massive territorial fights with {{p|Squawkabilly}} in the [[Paldea]] region.

Fletchling and its Evolutions are the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Gale Wings}} as an [[Ability]].

===Evolution===
Fletchling evolves into {{p|Fletchinder}}, which evolves into {{p|Talonflame}}.

[[File:Fletchling_3DS_trophy_SSB4.png|thumb|150px|Fletching trophy in ''Super Smash Bros. for 3DS'']]
Fletchling appears as a {{i|Poké Ball}} summon. It jumps around and {{m|peck}}s opponents. It can fly to reach nearby platforms or come back to the stage if needed.

Fletching also appears as a trophy in both versions of the game.

====Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''These Normal/Flying-type Pokémon are a popular choice with trainers, thanks to their beautiful voices and friendly personalities. They're found all over the cities of the Kalos region. They are quite territorial, however, and aren't afraid to use Peck on anyone who trespasses.''

'''PAL''': ''Fletchling, the Tiny Robin Pokémon. This Normal- and Flying- Pokémon is often seen in cities in the Kalos region. It's popular with trainers due to its friendly personality and beautiful voice. However, they can be very territorial, and if you bring one out in battle, it won't hesitate to use Peck on one of your opponents.''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Fletchling returns as a Pokémon summoned from the Poké Ball, retaining the same behavior from the previous game.

==Trivia==
* Fletchling is the only {{DL|Appendix:Fan terminology|Early-route Pokémon|regional bird Pokémon}} to have its primary type changed upon [[Evolution]].
* Fletchling was designed by [[Saya Tsuruta]].<ref>[[Pokémon Trading Card Game: Online Illustration Exhibition]]: Commentary by Saya Tsuruta on [[Fletchling (Unified Minds 179)]]</ref>

===Origin===
Fletchling seems to be based on a {{wp|Japanese robin}}. Its tail design and name might suggest that it was also based in part on an arrow.

====Name origin====
Fletchling may be a combination of ''{{wp|fletching}}'' (fin-shaped stabilizers on arrows, typically made from feathers) and ''{{wp|fledge|fledgling}}'' or ''{{wp|hatchling}}''.

Yayakoma may be a combination of 矢 ''ya'' (arrow), 稚児 ''yayako'' (baby), and 駒鳥 ''komadori'' ({{wp|Japanese robin}}).
