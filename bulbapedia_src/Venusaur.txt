'''Venusaur''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''フシギバナ''' ''Fushigibana'') is a dual-type {{2t|Grass|Poison}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Ivysaur}} starting at [[level]] 32. It is the final form of {{p|Bulbasaur}}.

Venusaur has two forms: '''Mega Venusaur''' and '''Gigantamax Venusaur'''. It can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Venusaur using the [[Venusaurite]], and can [[Gigantamax]] into Gigantamax Venusaur if it has the {{DL|Gigantamax|Gigantamax Factor}}. Gigantamax Venusaur was introduced in [[The Isle of Armor]].

Venusaur is the [[game mascot]] of {{game|Red and Green|s|Pokémon Green}} and its [[remake]] {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s|Pokémon LeafGreen}}, appearing on the box art of both games.

==Biology==
[[File:Erika Venusaur bulb closed PM.png|thumb|200px|left|Venusaur with its bulb closed]]
Venusaur is a squat, quadrupedal {{wp|amphibian}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with bumpy, blue-green skin. It has small, circular red eyes and a short, blunt snout. Its mouth is wide with two pointed teeth in the upper jaw and four in the lower jaw. On top of its head are small, pointed ears with reddish-pink insides. It has three clawed toes on each foot. The bud on its back has bloomed into a large pink, white-spotted flower. The flower is supported by a thick, brown trunk surrounded by green fronds. A female Venusaur has a {{wp|gynoecium}} in the center of its flower.

Venusaur uses its flower to catch the sun's rays to convert them into energy, which causes the flower to become more vibrant. The flower releases a soothing scent that attracts Pokémon and calms emotions. This scent becomes stronger after a rainy day.  Venusaur is at its strongest in the summertime when there is much more sunlight to absorb. As shown in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Venusaur releases a soothing fragrance while sleeping. Venusaur has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: ''Sunbathing Sleep'', ''Sturdy Sleep'', ''Vines-Out Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''. In the {{aniseries|OS}} episode ''[[EP051|Bulbasaur's Mysterious Garden]]'', Venusaur has demonstrated the ability to manipulate nature, release several vines from its back, and lead Evolution ceremonies for {{p|Bulbasaur}} and {{p|Ivysaur}}. This Pokémon is rarely found in the wild, but it has been known to inhabit {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|grasslands}}.

===Forms===
[[File:003Venusaur-Gigantamax 2.png|thumb|left|200px|Gigantamax Venusaur using {{m|G-Max Vine Lash}}]]
Venusaur has two forms: Mega Venusaur and [[Gigantamax]] Venusaur.

;Mega Venusaur
When [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolved]], the flower on Venusaur's back grows more prominent, and two smaller pink flowers bloom, one on its forehead and one on its rear. Its legs and back have become sturdier to support the extra weight of the flower.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160406143554/http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/pokemon/mega_pokemon/#Mega%20Venusaur Mega Venusaur | Official Website | Pokémon X and Pokémon Y]</ref> Additional leaves with woody stems, supported by vines, are also grown around the flower. Mega Venusaur also develops dark markings on its forehead below the new flower on its forehead.

;Gigantamax Venusaur
As Gigantamax Venusaur, it becomes larger with its flower blooming even further, covering its body. These flowers have a taller bud and extraordinarily thick, springy petals capable of shielding Gigantamax Venusaur. Its eyes have light green sclerae and orange irises. More foliage grows from under its flower, and the trunk supporting it becomes shorter. It has several light green markings located at its belly.

Gigantamax Venusaur attacks with its thick vines, which are powerful enough to topple down a 10-story building. Gigantamax Venusaur's flower can similarly spread enough pollen to resemble a volcanic eruption. Breathing in this pollen can cause uncontrollable sneezing, and inhaling large amounts can even cause fainting. However, this pollen also promotes plant growth in areas where it lands.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/expansionpass/pokemon/gigantamax-venusaur/ Gigantamax Venusaur | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref>

Gigantamax Venusaur is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of using the [[G-Max Move]] {{m|G-Max Vine Lash}}.

====Major appearances====
=====[[May's Venusaur]]=====
In ''[[DP078|Pruning a Passel of Pals!]]'', {{an|May}}'s Bulbasaur was revealed to have evolved all the way into a Venusaur during her absence from the series. She was briefly seen facing off against a {{pkmn|Coordinator}}'s {{p|Marill}} in the [[Contest Battle|Battle Stage]] of the [[Wallace Cup]].

=====Other=====
In ''[[EP051|Bulbasaur's Mysterious Garden]]'', a Venusaur was the leader of an Evolution ceremony for Bulbasaur. It appeared again in ''[[SM042|Alola, Kanto!]]'', during a flashback.

A Venusaur [[nickname]]d Bruteroot appeared in ''[[M01|Mewtwo Strikes Back]]'' and its remake ''[[M22|Mewtwo Strikes Back—Evolution]]'', under the ownership of [[Corey]]. It was taken away from her by one of {{OBP|Mewtwo|M01}}'s special [[Poké Ball]]s but was liberated by Ash along with the other confiscated Pokémon. Along with [[Ash's Charizard]] and [[Neesha]]'s {{p|Blastoise}}, they were the only confiscated Pokémon not to be cloned and they had the same marks that Bulbasaurtwo had, indicating that it was likely obtained by Mewtwo through different means than the ones used to clone. Its clone reappeared in ''[[Mewtwo Returns]]''. Corey's Venusaur also appeared in an alternate timeline of the main series that was introduced in ''[[M20|I Choose You!]]'', where it was seen battling [[Neesha]]'s {{p|Blastoise}}; it is unknown if it holds the same nickname in that timeline.

In ''[[EP112|Enter The Dragonite]]'', {{OBP|Drake|Orange League}}'s Venusaur was used in a battle against [[Ash's Tauros]], and it lost to Tauros' {{m|Take Down}} attack.

In ''[[EP185|The Light Fantastic]]'', a Venusaur was the longtime friend of [[Gan Gogh]]. He used it to battle Team Rocket.

When {{TRT}} was working at the {{jo|Battle Park}} in ''[[EP248|One Trick Phony!]]'', [[James]] used a Venusaur during a battle against [[Ash's Cyndaquil]] as part of an elaborate plan to capture {{AP|Pikachu}}.

In ''[[AG073|Grass Hysteria!]]'', a Venusaur was the leader of a group of {{type|Grass}} Pokémon living in the [[Forbidden Forest]].

In ''[[AG151|Weekend Warrior]]'', {{OBP|Jeremy|AG151}}'s Venusaur was used during the second half of the {{ka|Silver Town}} [[Pokémon Contest]]. Jeremy's Venusaur, which knew {{m|Frenzy Plant}}, came very close to defeating [[May's Combusken]], but the Young Fowl Pokémon came through and pulled off a come-from-behind victory.

[[Spenser]] has a Venusaur that first appeared in ''[[AG163|Cutting the Ties that Bind]]''. Spenser had Venusaur use {{m|Sweet Scent}} to drive away the furious {{p|Beedrill}}. Venusaur was the second Pokémon that the Palace Maven used in his battle with {{Ash}} at the [[Battle Palace]] in ''[[AG164|Ka Boom with a View!]]''. The Seed Pokémon won against {{AP|Heracross}}, but lost to his {{AP|Swellow}}. It reappeared in a flashback in ''[[AG165|King and Queen for a Day!]]''.

In ''[[XY017|A Rush of Ninja Wisdom!]]'', [[Nihei]]'s male Venusaur appeared in a fantasy. He made his physical debut in ''[[XY099|The Legend of the Ninja Hero!]]'' at [[Ninja Village]]. Nihei used Venusaur in a battle against [[Sanpei]] and his Greninja and won. In ''[[XY100|A Festival of Decisions!]]'', Venusaur was used to battle the ninja army's Pokémon and was able to defeat a {{p|Gengar}}.

In ''[[XYS04|Mega Evolution Special IV]]'', a {{pkmn|Trainer}}'s Mega Venusaur was one of the ten Mega-Evolved Pokémon that [[Alain]] and his {{TP|Alain|Charizard}} had to defeat. It was Alain's first opponent, putting up a tough match, but was eventually defeated.

In ''[[SM142|A Full Battle Bounty!]]'', {{an|Professor Kukui}}'s male Venusaur was the third Pokémon he used in his [[Full Battle]] against Ash. He went up against {{AP|Rowlet}}, defeating it before losing to {{AP|Torracat}}.

In ''[[JN003|Ivysaur's Mysterious Tower!]]'', multiple Venusaur evolved from Ivysaur after they traveled to a new {{OBP|Gym|GO}}, which was under construction in [[Vermilion City]], so they could absorb the sunlight needed for the Evolution process.

====Minor appearances====
In ''[[EP017|Island of the Giant Pokémon]]'', a giant robot Venusaur was at [[Pokémon Land]].

In ''[[EP020|The Ghost of Maiden's Peak]]'', a {{p|Gastly}} created an illusory Venusaur to frighten [[Ash's Bulbasaur]]. Gastly subsequently combined this Venusaur with an illusory {{p|Blastoise}} to create a {{DL|Variant Pokémon|Venustoise}}, which terrified both Squirtle and Bulbasaur to the point where they did not want to battle anymore.

Venusaur made its physical debut in ''[[EP043|The March of the Exeggutor Squad]]''.

In ''[[M02|The Power of One]]'', a Venusaur sensed the disturbance caused by [[Lawrence III]].

In ''[[EP108|Pokémon Double Trouble]]'', a Venusaur was working out in the [[Kumquat Gym]]. However, this scene was removed from the dub due to the appearance of {{p|Jynx}}.

In ''[[EP180|Houndoom's Special Delivery]]'', a Venusaur was seen in a field of flowers. It tried to use {{m|Sleep Powder}} on [[Misty's Togepi]], but a {{p|Houndoom}} blocked the attack, causing itself to fall {{status|sleep|asleep}}.

In ''[[EP187|Moving Pictures]]'', a Venusaur was seen in a [[Pokémon Center]].

Two Venusaur appeared in the opening sequence of ''[[M07|Destiny Deoxys]]''.

In ''[[AG135|Numero Uno Articuno]]'', a Venusaur was one of the Pokémon [[Noland]] offered for challengers to battle at the {{gdis|Battle Factory|III}}. However, Ash instead chose to battle {{TP|Noland|Articuno}}.

A Venusaur capable of Mega Evolving appeared in a fantasy in ''[[JN084|An Adventure of Mega Proportions!]]''.

A Trainer's Venusaur appeared in ''[[JN136|This Could be the Start of Something Big!]]''.

A Venusaur appeared in ''[[HZ085|The Pokémon Paradise of Laqua!]]'', among the Pokémon living in [[Laqua]].

Now, that's got to be intimidating!''

==Trivia==
* Venusaur shares its height (6'7"/2.0 m), weight (220.5&nbsp;lbs./100.0&nbsp;kg) and Egg Groups (Monster and Grass), with another {{type|Grass}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}, {{p|Tropius}}.
* Venusaur's evolutionary line is the only [[first partner Pokémon]] evolutionary line to have the {{t|Poison}} type.
** Venusaur's evolutionary line is also the only first partner Pokémon evolutionary line to have each member appear at least once in the [[Super Smash Bros. series]].
* Venusaur is among [[Ken Sugimori]]'s favorite Pokémon. However, it is also his least favorite Pokémon to draw due to its complex design.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20101230153442/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/interview/irbj/sp/index4.html</ref>
* Venusaur's number in the [[National Pokédex]] and the [[List of Pokémon by Fiore Browser number|Fiore Browser]] are the same: 003.
* Due to [[List of censored words in Generation V|the censor]] that prevents Pokémon with offensive [[nickname]]s being traded on the [[GTS]], a Venusaur with an English name could not be [[trade]]d on the GTS without a nickname in [[Generation V]].
* Venusaur shares its {{pkmn|category}} with its pre-evolved forms and {{p|Sunkern}}. They are all known as the Seed Pokémon.
* If the {{player}} chooses {{p|Charmander}} as their first partner Pokémon in {{game|Red and Blue|s}}, or locks themselves out of receiving {{p|Bulbasaur}} in {{game|Yellow}}, it is impossible to get Venusaur registered in the [[Pokédex]] without [[trade|trading]], as no NPC in said games uses a Venusaur except the rival if the player chose {{p|Squirtle}}. In {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}}, Cooltrainer Albert uses a Venusaur in Knockout Mode at the [[Trainer Tower]].
* Venusaur is the first Pokémon in [[National Pokédex]] order to have [[gender differences]].
* Venusaur is the only Pokémon to be a [[Game mascot|mascot]] for a {{game|Red and Green|s|Japan-exclusive}} [[core series|core game]].

===Merchandise===

* Venusaur appears in {{DL|Pokémon Battle Chess|Pokémon Battle Chess}}. It behaves like the rook piece in chess.

===Origin===
According to [[Ken Sugimori]] in a Japanese interview discussing the Pokémon franchise, Venusaur and its pre-Evolutions were inspired by {{wp|frog}}s.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20101230153442/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/interview/irbj/sp/index4.html Page 4 of interview with Game Freak, hosted on Nintendo's official website] (Japanese, archived)</ref> In particular, its short legs, stout appearance, ear-like protrusions on its head, and the {{a|Thick Fat}} Ability on Mega Venusaur, together make it resemble {{wp|Ceratophrys|horned frogs}}. Unlike Bulbasaur, Venusaur's "ears" have hollows, indicating that they are in fact ears and not glands, as seen in many species of frogs and toads. 

The flower on its back resembles the ''{{wp|Rafflesia arnoldii}}''.

====Name origin====
Venusaur may be a combination of ''Venus'' (referring to the {{wp|Venus flytrap}} plant) or ''venom'' and ''dinosaur''.

Fushigibana may be a combination of 不思議 ''fushigi'' (strange; mysterious) and 花 ''hana'' (flower).
