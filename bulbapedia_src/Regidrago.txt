'''Regidrago''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''レジドラゴ''' ''Regidorago'') is a {{type|Dragon}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced during [[Generation VIII]], in [[The Crown Tundra]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

It is a member of the [[legendary giants]] along with {{p|Regirock}}, {{p|Regice}}, {{p|Registeel}}, and {{p|Regieleki}}.

==Biology==
[[File:Gary Regidrago Dragon Energy.png|thumb|left|250px|Regidrago forming a mouth while using {{m|Dragon Energy}}]]
Regidrago is a spherical, golem-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. It has a dark red body made of crystallized dragon energy, with the energy being the densest at its central core. Its face has a pattern of seven blue dots that resembles the capital letter "Y". It has two red legs with black feet that are shaped like teeth. Its arms are black on the outside and dark red on the inside, and resemble a dragon's head; the right arm resembles a dragon's upper jaw, complete with horns and "eye sockets", while the left arm is shaped like a lower jaw. Two red spikes shaped like wings are located behind its back, although it doesn't use these to fly, as it is capable of floating in the air. Regidrago's body and the "eye sockets" on its right arm can glow pink when attacking.

According to legend, Regidrago was created by the [[Legendary Pokémon]] {{p|Regigigas}} using crystallized dragon energy. It used to be worshipped by [[Human|humans]], however, at some point, ancient people started fearing its power and sealed it away in the [[Split-Decision Ruins]]. Regigigas ran out of crystals after building Regidrago's head and it was sealed away by ancient people, who feared the destruction it would cause should it ever be completed.<ref name=SwShsite/> Due to its body composition, Regidrago is said to have the most powerful {{type|Dragon}} moves of all Pokémon,<ref name=SwShsite/> along with the power of every Dragon-type Pokémon. Regidrago can fire an attack made of intense dragon energy by combining its arms to form a mouth<ref name=SwShsite>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/expansionpass/pokemon/regidrago/ Newly discovered Legendary Pokémon Regidrago | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref>. There is an unproven academic theory that posits that Regidrago's arms originated from the head of an ancient dragon Pokémon. It can {{m|Dragon Energy|convert its life-force into power}}, attacking its opposers.

Regidrago is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Dragon Energy}}. It is also the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Dragon's Maw}} as an [[Ability]].

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
[[Pokémon UNITE]]: Regidrago appears as a wild Pokémon in the [[Mer Stadium|Full-Burst Battle! Dragon Dustup]] quickplay mode. Defeating it will make it advance towards one of the opposing team's goal zones while attacking opposing Pokémon on the way, scoring some points depending on its current HP and making said goal zone defenseless for a while upon reaching it. Its moves contain Dragon Energy, that can stun Pokémon in a straight shot and {{m|Crunch}} that can deal damage when it gets close.

==Trivia==
*Regidrago is the only member of the [[legendary giants]] that:
**Does not have a base {{stat|HP}} stat of 80.
**Does not have a base {{stat|Speed}} that is a multiple of 50.
**Cannot learn {{m|Lock-On}} and {{m|Zap Cannon}} by level up; instead it learns {{m|Laser Focus}} (in [[Generation VIII]]) or {{m|Focus Energy}} (in [[Generation IX]]) and {{m|Dragon Energy}}.
**Does not learn a move at level 24.
**Does not share a weakness with any of the other giants.
**Has its official romanized Japanese name differ from its English name.
**Does not have a symmetrical silhouette. 
*Along with {{p|Regieleki}}, Regidrago is the only [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in Generation VIII that is not prevented from being {{Shiny}} in {{g|Sword and Shield}}.
*Regidrago's base HP and Speed stats are the reverse of Regieleki's.
*Regidrago is the only pure Dragon-type Legendary Pokémon.
* When Regidrago {{Tera}}stallizes, the Tera Jewel appears on top of its right arm instead of on its head.

===Origin===
Regidrago appears to be based on a dragon head and a crystal ball or a pearl held by an {{wp|Asian dragon}}. Along with the other [[legendary giants]], Regidrago may also be based on the golems of Hebrew legend. The legends cast them as servants of higher powers and are said to have writing on their heads. When the writing is removed, the creature would be weakened, or even killed in some legends. Regidrago's face that consists of seven dots may be based on the {{wp|Braille alphabet}} which was used in the puzzle for encountering the legendary giants for the first time in the [[Sealed Chamber]].

The five legendary giants may also collectively be themed after historical epochs, with Regidrago representing the {{wp|Middle Ages}}, a period known for its legends of dragons. Alternatively, Regidrago may represent the {{wp|Mesozoic}}, the era when dinosaurs walked the Earth, also known as the Age of Reptiles. Regidrago being the remnants of an ancient dragon or crystallized dragon energy may be a vague reference to {{wp|fossil fuel}}s.

====Name origin====
Regidrago and Regidorago may be a combination of ''regis'' (Latin for royal) and ''dragon''.
