'''Marill''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''マリル''' ''Maril'') is a dual-type {{2t|Water|Fairy}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation II]]. Prior to [[Generation VI]], it [[:Category:Pokémon that have had their type changed|was]] a pure {{type|Water}} Pokémon.

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Azurill}} when [[friendship Evolution|leveled up with high friendship]] and evolves into {{p|Azumarill}} starting at [[level]] 18.

==Biology==
Marill is a small, blue, bipedal semi-aquatic {{wp|rodent}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. It has a nearly spherical shape with a white belly and it has round ears with red insides. These sensitive ears can detect distant sounds. Marill's arms and feet are short and possess no visible digits. There is a blue, bubble-like ball at the tip of its zigzagging black tail. The tail is flexible and configured to stretch, and the ball is full of oil that acts as a buoy to help keep Marill afloat. The ball at the tip of its tail can glow when Marill attacks. In the {{aniseries|AG}} episode ''[[AG032|Abandon Ship!]]'', Marill was shown to be able to bounce on its tail. In the [[TCG]], Marill is [[Marill (HeartGold & SoulSilver 74)|shown]] to rapidly spin its tail, seemingly readying for an attack.

Marill is able to swim in strong water currents without being slowed down by the water's resistance, due to its water-repellent fur. Marill feeds on aquatic plants in addition to fishing for food. When it dives, its tail can be seen bobbing on the water's surface. It will anchor its tail around a tree when fishing at the edge of a fast-moving stream. Marill never gets cold after swimming in cold water, due to its water-repellent fur drying up quickly the moment it leaves the water. It lives on the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Water's-edge Pokémon|water's edge}}.

Prior to [[Generation VI]], Marill and its evolutionary relatives are the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Huge Power}} as an [[Ability]].

''This Aqua Mouse Pokémon evolves into Azumarill. The round ball on the end of its tail acts like a flotation device, so it can float safely on the roughest of water conditions. It resides on [[Mt. Mortar]] in seclusion; few of the creatures are ever seen. Marill's cuteness has earned it a large and loyal fan base.''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Marill appears as a {{sbw|Spirits (characters)|Spirit}}.

==Trivia==
[[File:Spr 2d 179.png|thumb|Marill's sprite in the Nintendo Space World demo]]
* In an early design for Marill that was used in the [[Pokémon Gold and Silver Spaceworld '97 demo|Nintendo Space World 1997 demo of Pokémon Gold and Silver]], Marill had a pink body instead of blue, and lacked its jagged tail.
* For months prior to the release of {{game|Gold and Silver|s}}, Marill was often incorrectly referred to as "Pikablu" by fans due to its slight resemblance to {{p|Pikachu}}.
** It is even referred to as "Pikablu" on Topps' [[Pokémon the First Movie Trading Cards]].
* Marill is tied with {{p|Togepi}} and {{p|Azurill}} for having the lowest base {{stat|Attack}} of all {{type|Fairy}} Pokémon.
* Marill has higher catch rate than its pre-evolved form Azurill.
** In addition, Marill and Azurill both have the lowest base {{stat|Special Attack}} of all Fairy-type Pokémon.
* Because {{p|Azurill}}'s gender ratio does not match that of its evolved forms and its Evolution is not dependent on gender, being female 75% of the time while Marill and Azumarill are female only 50% of the time, female Azurill have a one in three chance of [[Evolution|evolving]] into a male Marill prior to [[Generation VI]]. Whether this will happen is determined by its [[personality value]], specifically the last byte. Azurill is the only Pokémon to do this.
* When they have the {{a|Sap Sipper}} Ability, Marill and Azumarill are the only non-{{type|Dragon}} Pokémon that resist or are immune to all three of the [[first partner Pokémon]] types ({{t|Grass}}, {{t|Fire}}, and {{t|Water}}).
* Marill's name was originally spelled '''Marril''', as shown in some merchandise for [[M01|the first movie]].

===Origin===
Marill may be based on a combination of a {{wp|mouse}} and a {{wp|beach ball}} or possibly a {{wp|personal flotation device}} or {{wp|lifebuoy}}. Its body and ears also resemble a {{wp|Properties of water|water molecule}}.

Additionally, Marill may be based on {{wp|water rat}}s, closely related species of {{wp|semiaquatic}} rodents of the superfamily {{wp|Muroidea}} that includes the {{wp|European water vole}}, the {{wp|rakali}} from {{wp|Australia (continent)|Australia}}, the {{wp|Nectomys|South American water rats}}, and the {{wp|Round-tailed muskrat|Florida water rat}}.

Based on Marill's name, {{Shiny}} color scheme, and tail, it may be also based on {{wp|marimo}}, free-floating, spherical balls of algae that are also known as lake balls or moss balls.

====Name origin====
Marill and Maril may be a combination of ''mar'' (Spanish and Portuguese for ''sea'') or 丸い ''marui'' (''round'' or ''circular'') or 鞠 ''mari'' (ball), 瑠璃 ''ruri'' ({{wp|lapis lazuli}}), and possibly ''rill'' (a small river or brook) and マリンブルー ''marine blue''.
