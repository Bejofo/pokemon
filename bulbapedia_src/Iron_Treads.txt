'''Iron Treads''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''テツノワダチ''' ''Tetsunowadachi'') is a dual-type {{2t|Ground|Steel}} [[Paradox Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation IX]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

It is said to be either a future relative of {{p|Donphan}} or a counterpart of it from a parallel timeline. It also has an ancient variant, {{p|Great Tusk}}.

==Biology==
[[File:990Iron Treads Dream 3.png|thumb|left|200px|Rolled-up Iron Treads]]
Iron Treads is a quadrupedal Pokémon with a spherical gray metallic body and a black underbelly. On its face are a pair of short black tusks and a black half-moon pixelated screen, which usually displays a pattern of a pair of angry red eyes; underneath them is a metal plate that can be retracted to reveal its mouth. Its most prominent physical feature is a segmented tread jutting out from its back, and extending to the front of its face. This tread is black and has bright red glowing patterns accenting it. Iron Treads also has long black plate-like earlobes, and metal plates covering its legs, which can be retracted to aid in its rolling attacks.

Iron Treads is said to have a cruel nature. It is capable of swiftly curling up its body and rolling like a wheel to attack. According to the [[Pokécology]] book, Iron Treads's tire-like armor is what allows it to rotate and move around. Iron Treads will additionally curl up into this form and rock itself back and forth when sleeping. The trails it leaves behind are described as similar to scorched earth.<ref>(November 8, 2022). "[https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/news/books/ The Scarlet Book and the Violet Book]." Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet Official Website</ref> It also reportedly fatally injured one of the explorers of the Area Zero Expedition team in the past. In an article from a September issue of {{DL|Magazines in the Pokémon world|Occulture}} magazine, it is said that there have been reports of Iron Treads in an arid corner of [[Paldea]]. It is said to resemble {{p|Donphan}}. Rumors suggest that Iron Treads is some kind of weapon using technology not of this world, though this is unproven. When it falls asleep, it turns itself off, curling itself into its wheel form and causing the red energy on its treads to turn black.

According to [[Professor Turo|AI Turo]], Iron Treads is a future Pokémon related to Donphan. However, according to a version of Professor Turo that appeared at the [[Crystal Pool]], Iron Treads is a counterpart of Donphan from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. Iron Treads was brought to the depths of [[Area Zero]] by a [[time machine]] built by Professor Turo ten years ago. Iron Treads was the first [[Paradox Pokémon]] to be discovered 200 years ago in Area Zero by the Area Zero Expedition team and recorded by [[Heath]] in his [[Violet Book]]. How it arrived there at the time, however, is unclear.

At some point, one individual escaped Area Zero and consumed [[Herba Mystica]]. This Iron Treads became the Quaking Earth Titan, one of the [[Titan Pokémon]] found in [[Paldea]]. It mainly resides near a hidden cave in [[Asado Desert]], where it feeds on [[Sour Herba Mystica]].

===NPC appearances===
* [[Pokémon Violet]]: Iron Treads, known as the Quaking Earth Titan, is a minor character and a boss encounter in the games. It became a [[Titan Pokémon]] after consuming some [[Herba Mystica]].
** The {{player}} and [[Arven]] eventually found it in [[Asado Desert]] to find the [[Sour Herba Mystica|Herba Mystica it guards]] and defeated it, forcing it to flee. After both took its Herba Mystica, Iron Treads became a normal-sized Pokémon once again. After this, it can be rematched in its original location, and will have the [[Mark|Titan Mark]] when captured.

Tetsunowadachi can be taken literally as 鉄の轍 ''tetsu no wadachi'' (iron treads).
