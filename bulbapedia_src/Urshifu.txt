'''Urshifu''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ウーラオス''' ''Wulaosu'') is a {{type|Fighting}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced during [[Generation VIII]], in [[The Isle of Armor]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Kubfu}} when shown the scroll in one of the [[Towers of Two Fists]] or when exposed to the [[Scroll of Darkness]] or the [[Scroll of Waters]].

It has two [[#Form data|separate forms]]. Its form is determined by how it is evolved from Kubfu.
* In its '''Single Strike Style''', it is dual-type {{2t|Fighting|Dark}}. Kubfu evolves into this form when shown the [[Scroll of Darkness]].
* In its '''Rapid Strike Style''', it is dual-type {{2t|Fighting|Water}}. Kubfu evolves into this form when shown the [[Scroll of Waters]].

(Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for more details.)

Urshifu has two [[Gigantamax]] forms, one for each Style. It can Gigantamax into '''Gigantamax Urshifu''' if it has the {{DL|Gigantamax|Gigantamax Factor}}.

Urshifu is the [[game mascot]] of [[The Isle of Armor]], appearing on the boxarts of the {{g|Sword and Shield Expansion Pass}}<!-- per discussion on talk page, please do not add the words "in its Single Strike Style" here -->.

==Biology==
Urshifu is a large, bipedal {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} resembling a humanoid black bear with a wushu motif. It has a muscular build with long legs and long arms with large paws and claws for striking. Its body and head are covered in gray, black, and white fur, minus the yellow muzzle. The front of Urshifu's pelt slightly resembles a traditional frog buttoned/braid buttoned hanging off ends on both front and back. The fur on Urshifu's head is spikier and flares into a flowing white and black headband. The backs of Urshifu's hands, its knuckles, and the tops of its feet are also white-colored.

Urshifu's fighting style and personality are determined by how it trained as a {{p|Kubfu}} and which one of the [[Scroll of Darkness|special]] [[Scroll of Waters|scrolls]] it reads from one of the [[Towers of Two Fists]]. Urshifu is the evolved form of the "{{p|Kubfu|secret armor}}" of the [[Isle of Armor]]'s [[Master Dojo]], and reaches its full potential through either the path of darkness or the path of waters. It is also known to enjoy eating [[honey]], particularly [[Max Honey]] found in [[Honeycalm Island]]. Wild Urshifu live in mountainous areas of a region far away from the [[Galar Route 9|Galar]] [[region]], training its legs and moves by racing across sheer cliffs. 

Urshifu is the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Unseen Fist}} as its [[Ability]].

===Forms===
Urshifu has two forms, Single Strike Style and Rapid Strike Style, each with unique [[Gigantamax]] forms. The two Styles appear nearly identical to each other, with the main visual differences being the look of the fur on top of its head, and the posing of both of its fists and legs.

;Single Strike Style
Appearance-wise, the fur on top of Single Strike Style Urshifu's head and on its legs flows up, while its headband flares upward and backward.  The two styles also have different default poses: Single Strike Style Urshifu has its front fist raised, back fist lowered, and both feet planted.

Single Strike Style Urshifu prefers battling without holding back, and often employs one-hit KO strategies. If enraged, it will mercilessly attack the opponent until utterly crushed. Its movements are direct and involve rushing in a straight line. When it is a certain distance away from an opponent, it quickly leaps in to unleash {{m|Wicked Blow|a powerful blow}}.<ref name=UrshifuSite>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/expansionpass/pokemon/urshifu/ Urshifu | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref>

Single Strike Style Urshifu is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Wicked Blow}}.

;Rapid Strike Style
Appearance-wise, the fur on top of Rapid Strike Style Urshifu's head and on its legs flows down, while its headband flares forward and outward. Rapid Strike Style Urshifu has its back fist raised, front fist lowered, and front foot lifted off the ground.

Rapid Strike Style Urshifu prefers calmly observing the opponents and their strengths while dodging. Its movements and attacks have been compared to a river, flowing but unyielding. It uses flowing movements to ward off an opponent's attack before overwhelming them with {{m|Surging Strikes|rapid strikes}}.<ref name="UrshifuSite" />

Rapid Strike Style Urshifu is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Surging Strikes}}. 

;Gigantamax Single Strike Style
When Single Strike Style Urshifu [[Gigantamax]]es, the patterns on its fur become significantly accentuated, its headband lengthens, and its eyes and mouth take on a white glow. In general, parts of its fur that used to be gray are now white, and parts that used to be black are now red. In addition, Urshifu's leg fur and headband become spikier.

Gigantamax Single Strike Style Urshifu has been called "the very embodiment of rage" and "a divine emissary that banishes evil spirits with its fury."<ref name="GmaxUrshifuSite">[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/expansionpass/pokemon/gigantamax-urshifu/ Gigantamax Urshifu | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref> It is believed that Gigantamax Single Strike Style Urshifu can rid the world of its malevolence through its terrifying expression and shouting. The shockwaves released from its fists can blow away [[Dynamax]]ed Pokémon with just one hit.

Gigantamax Single Strike Style Urshifu is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of using the [[G-Max Move]] {{m|G-Max One Blow}}.

; Gigantamax Rapid Strike Style
When Rapid Strike Style Urshifu [[Gigantamax]]es, the patterns on its fur become significantly accentuated, its headband lengthens, and its eyes and mouth take on a white glow. In general, parts of its fur that used to be gray are now white, and parts that used to be black are now blue. In addition, Urshifu's leg fur and headband become rounder and less spiky.

Gigantamax Rapid Strike Style Urshifu maintains a perfect one-legged stance in a calm, unflinching manner. Opponents who face it may either feel greatly agitated or experience a sense of relief as if freed from evil spirits.<ref name="GmaxUrshifuSite" /> Gigantamax Rapid Strike Style Urshifu could supposedly destroy those with evil in their hearts by simply glaring at them.

Gigantamax Rapid Strike Style Urshifu is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of using the [[G-Max Move]] {{m|G-Max Rapid Flow}}.

===NPC appearances ===
*'''[[Pokémon Sword and Shield]]: [[The Isle of Armor]]: {{DL|Mustard|Gives away|Urshifu}}''' is a major character in the [[Pokémon Sword and Shield Expansion Pass|DLC]]. As a {{p|Kubfu}}, it serves as the "Secret Armor" of the [[Master Dojo]] and is given to the player by [[Mustard]] after passing his three trials. It is later evolved into Single Strike Style or a Rapid Strike Style Urshifu after they defeat Mustard and his own Kubfu at the final floor of the [[Tower of Darkness]] or the [[Tower of Waters]], by examining the [[Scroll of Darkness]] or the [[Scroll of Waters]]. The player later unlocks Urshifu's [[Gigantamax]] potential and has the chance to use it against Mustard's own Urshifu in the final battle against him.

==Trivia==
*Urshifu and its pre-Evolution were designed by [[Yusuke Ohmura]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/yusuke_omura/status/1280804410176622593 Tweet about designing Kubfu and Urshifu]</ref>
*Urshifu is the only [[Legendary Pokémon]] that has a [[Gigantamax]] form, and consequently the only Legendary Pokémon that can use a [[G-Max Move]].
** It is also the only Pokémon with more than one Gigantamax form, and consequently the only Pokémon with more than one G-Max Move.
**It is also the only Pokémon with a Gigantamax Form whose {{Shiny}} form is unavailable, not counting {{p|Melmetal}}, as Melmetal has been made legitimately available in Shiny form, albeit without the Gigantamax Factor, which it cannot gain from {{DL|Master Dojo|Max Soup}}.

===Origin===
Urshifu may be based on an {{wp|Asian black bear}} and a ''{{wp|Wushu (sport)|wushu}}'' fighter. Its two forms may reference various styles of Chinese martial arts.

Single Strike Style Urshifu may have been based on {{wp|Bajiquan}}, a highly assaultive style featuring precise, powerful and direct strikes. This can give meaning to Single Strike Style Urshifu's signature move, Wicked Blow; which always lands in a critical hit and described to be a singular, strong punch. The posture of Single Strike Urshifu in its official artwork may be based on the ''shàngbù dǐngzhǒu'' (Chinese: 上步頂肘 / 上步顶肘) stance of Bajiquan, where the practicer takes a step forward and protrudes an elbow towards the opponent. The Single Strike Style may also be a reference to ''Ikken Hissatsu'' (一拳必殺), a term commonly associated with karate meaning "to annihilate in one blow" or "one hit, one kill."

Rapid Strike Style Urshifu and its signature move, Surging Strikes, may have been based on {{wp|Tai chi|Taijiquan}}, which is based around flowing movements, balance, dodging, deflecting, and tactile surging movements of "push hands." Its {{t|Water}} typing may also be a reference to the water parable in Taoism, which is popularized by the "be like water" quote by {{wp|Bruce Lee}}. The posture of Rapid Strike Urshifu in its official artwork may be based on the "golden rooster stands on one leg" posture of the Taijiquan forms.

Both Urshifu forms may represent each side of the martial art concept of "hard and soft" or "external and internal," with the Single Strike Style representing the "hard" or "external" side, while the Rapid Strike Style represents the "soft" or "internal" side.

Urshifu's [[Gigantamax]] forms may be inspired by {{wp|fierce deities}}, transformed Buddhas with terrifying appearances yet noble hearts, that judge and punish the spirits of the dead, and additionally, quell evil. Alternatively, they might have been influenced by {{wp|Nio}}, Agyō and Ungyō, a pair of viciously powerful {{wp|Buddhist deities}} that ward off evil spirits and protect good spirits, as Urshifu is also capable of doing both. Typically, statues depicting Agyō will have its mouth open as a sign of violent aggression, while Ungyō will have its mouth closed to represent latent strength. Gigantamax Urshifu's forms seem to reverse this, as Rapid Strike Style's mouth is closed and it attacks its foes relentlessly, while Single Strike Style's mouth is open and it confidently delivers a single punch to a weak point. Additionally, the statues are often colored red and blue, though the color is not a prominent trait of either, as they can each be red or blue, and sometimes both.

====Name origin====
Urshifu may be a combination of ''ursus'' (Latin for bear) and ''{{wp|shifu}}'' (Chinese for master). It may also involve ''{{wp|kung fu}}''.

Wulaosu may be a combination of ''{{wp|wushu}}'' (Chinese martial arts), 老師 / 老师 ''lǎoshī'' (Chinese for teacher), and possibly ウラー ''urā'' (hurrah, battle cry) and 押忍 ''osu'' (interjection used in Japanese martial arts).
