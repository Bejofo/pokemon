'''Scizor''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ハッサム''' ''Hassam'') is a dual-type {{2t|Bug|Steel}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation II]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Scyther}} when [[Trade Evolution|traded]] while holding a [[Metal Coat]]. It is one of Scyther's final forms, the other being {{p|Kleavor}}.

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for more details.)

Scizor can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Scizor''' using the [[Scizorite]].

==Biology==
[[File:Scizor no wings anime.png|thumb|left|250px|Scizor with its wings retracted]]
[[File:Sugimori Scizor AG.jpg|thumb|250px|{{aniseries|AG}} reference sheet]]
Scizor is a bipedal, {{wp|insecta|insectoid}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a red, metallic exoskeleton. It has gray, [[EP270|retractable]] forewings and hind wings with simple, curved venation. Its rounded head has three blunt horns extending above its forehead and eyes with dark yellow irises. Scizor's thin, black neck connects to a black, teardrop-shaped patch on its thorax. Scizor has broad shoulders and thin, segmented arms ending in large, round pincers, which comprise a third of Scizor's body weight. Scizor has a large, rounded abdomen with three black, chevron-shaped stripes extending from its waist down its front; female Scizor has larger abdomens than male Scizor. Scizor's legs are defined by large hip joints, thin thighs, and wide calves, and its feet end in a clawed toe on each side. Its arms appear similar to pincers of animals from {{wp|crustacean}} group like {{wp|crabs}} and the presence of markings resembling eyes gives the illusion of additional heads.

Scizor's slender body belies tremendous offensive power. Its body and muscles are made of metal that is as hard as steel, with pincers strong enough to crush any hard object. They can be opened and closed like jaws and are patterned with black eyespots with yellow "pupils". It will raise its pincers and wave them around to scare off predators or foes, giving it the appearance of having three heads. When it identifies an enemy, Scizor will use its pincers to beat up the opponent to the point there is nothing but scrap left afterwards. Scizor is normally incapable of flight, instead it quickly flaps its wings to regulate its body temperature to prevent itself from becoming too hot and melting, although it still can hover and glide for short distances, as shown in the {{pkmn|games}} and {{pkmn|animated series}}. Scizor is rarely found in the wild, though it can be found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|grasslands}}.

===Forms===
Scizor can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Scizor. 

Mega Scizor's pincers lengthen and develop serrations. The lower half of the pincers turn white and gain three-pointed spikes on the underside. The barbs on Mega Scizor's pincers can stab through concrete, and opponents caught in them cannot escape.<ref>http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/pokemon/mega_pokemon/#Scizor</ref> Its eyespots, along with its actual eyes, are now blue; the former additionally gains a black rim. Additional pieces of black armoring appear on various areas of its body: a three-pointed crest on its forehead and striated coverings on its shoulders and thighs. Mega Scizor's legs are less detailed and resemble large, tapered spikes with white tips. 

While Mega Scizor is formidable, it cannot maintain this form for extended periods, as it is overflown with excess energy from its Mega Evolution and is unable to regulate its body temperature properly. After too long, its body starts to melt, losing the strength to wield its heavy pincers. Mega Scizor's pincers can rip anything they grab to shreds, although it prefers to beat things up instead of grasping them.

===Evolution===
Scizor evolves from {{p|Scyther}}. It is one of Scyther's final forms. In the [[Hisui]] region, {{p|Kleavor}} is Scyther's other final form.

When released from a {{i|Poké Ball}}, Scizor will charge forward while flailing its claws, then leap high into the air and fall off the screen. Its attack pattern is similar to [[Marill (Pokémon)#Super Smash Bros. Melee|Marill]].

====Trophy information====
''This evolved form of {{p|Scyther}} has arms ending in large pincers with distinctive eye-spot markings. It's unable to fly very far with its wings, but it can affect its body temperature by flapping them at high speeds. Its sleek look has made Scizor quite popular among collectors.''

===[[Super Smash Bros. for Wii U]]===
Scizor makes a cameo appearance in the {{st|Kalos Pokémon League}}. When the stage transitions to the {{DL|Pokémon League (Kalos)|Ironworks Chamber}}, it can be seen in the background along with {{p|Steelix}}, {{p|Klinklang}}, and {{p|Honedge}}.

====Trophy information====
'''NA:''' ''Is that a three-headed monster?! No, wait... the left and right heads are actually claws! Creepy. Most creatures that have face-like patterns use them defensively to give themselves a chance to flee. Scizor throws that idea away and uses them to scare foes while it attacks!''

'''PAL:''' ''It may look like this Pokémon has three heads, but that's just what it wants you to think. Look closer and you'll see that two of them are actually claws. Most creatures with face-like markings use them to scare predators to give themselves a chance to run away, but Scizor seems more likely to attack while its foe is stunned!''

===[[Pokkén Tournament]]===

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Scizor returns as a {{i|Poké Ball}} item as it did in Super Smash Bros. Melee. It retains its movement and actions from prior games, using {{m|Metal Claw}} to fly at and slash opponents in its way with great speed. It then jumps off the screen. Its appearance on Kalos Pokémon League also returns. It also appears as a {{sbw|Spirits (characters)|Spirit}}.

===[[Pokémon UNITE]]===
{{main|Scizor (UNITE)}}
Scizor is playable through obtaining a Unite License. It is a melee all-rounder that starts as Scyther, which evolves into Scizor only if Bullet Punch is chosen at level 5. If Dual Wingbeat is chosen, Scyther will remain.

==Trivia==
* Scizor shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Kingler}}: They are both known as the Pincer Pokémon. However, Scizor was known as the Scissors Pokémon in [[Generation II]] and has been called the Scissor Pokémon in ''[[Pokémon the Series]]''.
* Scizor is the only {{type|Steel}} Pokémon to have {{DL|List of Pokémon by shape|Pokémon with two or more pairs of wings|two or more pairs of wings}}.
* Despite having different base stats, Scizor, {{p|Kleavor}}, and {{p|Scyther}} all have a base stat total of 500. As such, Scizor and Kleavor are the only Pokémon to not have their base stat total changed upon evolving.
* Mega Scizor is tied with {{me|Pinsir}}, Mega {{p|Heracross}}, and {{p|Genesect}} for the highest base stat total of all {{type|Bug}} Pokémon.
* Scizor can be seen as a parallel to {{p|Steelix}}:
** Both have pre-evolved forms from [[Generation I]] and were introduced in [[Generation II]].
** Both evolve via trading with a [[Metal Coat]].
** After evolving, both lose one of their pre-evolved form's [[type]]s and gain a {{t|Steel}} type.
** Both gain a [[Mega Evolution]] in [[Generation VI]].
** Both lose 40 points of base {{stat|Speed}} upon evolving.

===Origin===
Scizor may draw inspiration from {{wp|mantis}}es or {{wp|Climaciella|wasp mantidflies}}. Its arms appear similar to pincers of animals from {{wp|crustacean}} group like {{wp|crabs}} and due to the eye-like markings on them, they look like additional heads.

The additions on Mega Scizor's body may be based on {{wp|samurai}} armor.

====Name origin====
Scizor may be a corruption of ''{{wp|scissors|scissor}}'', or a combination of ''scissor'' and ''{{wp|razor}}''.

Hassam may be a corruption of 剪む ''hasamu'' (to clip or snip).
