'''Grubbin''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''アゴジムシ''' ''Agojimushi'') is a {{type|Bug}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation VII]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Charjabug}} starting at [[level]] 20, which evolves into {{p|Vikavolt}} when [[level]]ed up in a [[special magnetic field]] or when exposed to a [[Thunder Stone]].

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for these details.)

==Biology==
Grubbin is a small, insectoid {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. It has a white body with three nubs on either side resembling simple legs. There are two yellow spots on its side. Its head is dominated by two large, yellow mandibles with reddish-orange tips. The rest of its head is brown and has a reddish-orange structure with a yellow rim on top. It has large, black eyes with white pupils.

Grubbin typically lives underground. It uses its jaw as a weapon, a tool for burrowing, and for extracting sap from trees. Additionally, it can create sticky threads, which it shoots from its mouth and uses to swing around as though on suspension wires. It also uses these threads to stop opponents from moving, so it can then grab them in its mandibles, which are strong enough to snap thick tree branches. Even its natural enemies, such as {{p|Rookidee}} and {{p|Hoothoot}}, would rather run away than risk getting caught in its mandibles. It loves electricity and can be found near power plants. They can also be found near {{type|Electric}} Pokémon, as a means of avoiding attacks from bird-like Pokémon.<ref>[http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/grubbin/ Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Grubbin]</ref> As mentioned in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Grubbin uses its mandibles to makes nests underground. It has been observed sleeping in the dirt. It is believed that the dirt it sleeps in is possibly fluffy and comfortable.

===Evolution===
Grubbin evolves into {{p|Charjabug}}, which evolves into {{p|Vikavolt}}.

==Trivia==
* Grubbin, along with its evolved forms, were designed by [[Hitoshi Ariga]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/ariga_megamix/status/804500572967555072 Tweet by ありがひとし/ArigaHitoshi (@ariga_megamix).] Posted on December 2, 2016.</ref>
* Grubbin shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Blipbug}}. They are both known as the Larva Pokémon.
** Both Grubbin and Blipbug are also the only pure {{type|Bug}} Pokémon of their respective [[generation]].

===Origin===
Grubbin appears to be based on a {{wp|larva}}l {{wp|beetle}}, also known as a grub. It also bears resemblance to a common two-pronged electrical plug, which is further backed by the fact that it gains the {{t|Electric}} type upon evolving into Charjabug.

====Name origin====
Grubbin may be a combination of ''grub'' and ''grubbing'' (to scavenge or dig). Given its resemblance to an electrical plug, it may also be a play on the phrase "plug in".

Agojimushi may be a combination of 顎 ''ago'' (jaw) and 地虫 ''jimushi'' (grub).
