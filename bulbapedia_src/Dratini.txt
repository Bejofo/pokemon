'''Dratini''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ミニリュウ''' ''Miniryu'') is a {{type|Dragon}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Dragonair}} starting at [[level]] 30, which evolves into {{p|Dragonite}} starting at level 55.

==Biology==
[[File:Dratini molting.png|thumb|left|250px|A Dratini shedding its skin]]
Dratini is a {{wp|reptilian}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a blue serpentine body and a white underside. It has white, three-pronged fins on the sides of its head and a white bump on its forehead, which is its horn growing. Above its round, white snout are oval, purple eyes.

Dratini's life energy is constantly building so it is always growing, and can reach lengths of over six feet (2 meters). As it grows, it sheds its skin regularly; it hides behind a rapid waterfall during the process to protect itself, since the new skin is soft in texture. The shed skin can be tanned and used to create luxury boots. Dratini has been referred as the "Mirage Pokémon", because its existence was originally thought to be nothing more than a myth. Dratini was first discovered by a fisherman who spent 10 hours attempting to capture it. A small colony has also been found underwater, further confirming its existence. Dratini live {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Water's-edge Pokémon|near or in bodies of water}} with a rapid flow, such as the pools at the bottom of waterfalls. It lives a quiet life underwater, eating any food that sinks down to the bottom.

As mentioned in {{g|Sleep}}, Dratini's sleeping habits used to be a mystery due to how rare it was.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref> However, in recent years, Dratini's sleep styles have been discovered and well documented. This is due to trainers who have obtained Dratini and observed its sleeping habits. The four different sleep styles discovered are called ''Coiled Sleep'', ''Wriggly Sleep'', ''Uncoiled Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''.

In [[Generation II]], Dratini and its evolved forms were the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Outrage}}, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via {{pkmn|breeding}}.

===Evolution===
Dratini evolves into {{p|Dragonair}}, which evolves into {{p|Dragonite}}.

===Main series===
====Major appearances====
=====[[Clair's Dratini]]=====
Dratini made its physical English [[dub]] debut in ''[[EP251|Beauty is Skin Deep]]'', under the ownership of [[Clair]]. {{TRT}} wanted to steal it from her, but failed. It evolved into a Dragonair at the end of the episode.

=====Other=====

Dratini debuted in the [[banned episode]] [[EP035]], under the protection of the [[Kaiser|warden]] of the {{safari|Kanto}}. By the end of the episode, it turned out that the Dratini the warden met 30 years earlier had evolved into a Dragonair, and was now raising its own child Dratini.

In ''[[JN090|Showdown at the Gates of Warp!]]'', due to {{OBP|Dialga|recurring}} and {{OBP|Palkia|recurring}}'s influence, [[Ash's Dragonite]] [[devolution|devolved]] into a Dragonair and then into a Dratini. It was later reverted in the same episode.

====Minor appearances====
A Dratini appeared in one of {{TRT}}'s fantasies in ''[[EP037|Ditto's Mysterious Mansion]]''.

A Dratini appeared in ''[[PK09|Snorlax Snowman]]''.

A {{pkmn|Performer}}'s Dratini appeared in a video in ''[[XY080|Performing with Fiery Charm!]]''.

==In the manga==
[[File:Dratini PM.png|thumb|200px|Dratini in [[Pokémon Pocket Monsters]]]]
===Pokémon Adventures===
{{main|Clair's Dratini}}
{{main|Lance's Dratini}}
Dratini debuted in ''[[PS036|Drat That Dratini!]]'' in [[Viridian Forest]]. It had been attacking {{adv|Yellow}} but was calmed by {{adv|Red}}. It later appeared again in a flashback of Yellow's in ''[[PS083|Bang the Drum, Slowbro]]''.

[[Lance]]'s Dragonite was once a Dratini, as shown in a flashback in ''[[PS090|The Legend]]''. It was also revealed to be a Pokémon harmed by human industrialization. This motivated Lance to formulate his plot to destroy humanity many years later.

[[Clair]]'s Dragonair was once a Dratini, as shown in a flashback in ''[[PS168|The Last Battle II]]''.

In ''[[PS179|The Last Battle XIII]]'', a Dratini was sent to participate in the fight in [[Ilex Forest]].

In ''[[PS331|The Final Battle IV]]'', a Dratini helped {{adv|Emerald}} with his disabilities.

===Pokémon + Nobunaga's Ambition ~ Ranse's Color Picture Scroll ~===
A Dratini appeared in [[PNA6]], under the ownership of [[Ranmaru]].

===Pokémon Pocket Monsters===
A Dratini appeared in [[Lance's Dragonite]]'s fantasy in ''[[PM038|The Final Battle!!]]'' when it was telling a false story about how it met Lance.

A Dratini appeared in ''[[PM059|Good-Bye, Pikachu?!]]'', where it took a liking to {{PPM|Red's Pikachu|Pikachu}}. When {{PPM|Giovanni}} showed up with {{TP|Giovanni|Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan}}, Pikachu decided to protect it. Dratini then evolved into a Dragonair when it noticed that Pikachu got injured by Giovanni's {{p|Jolteon}} and {{p|Electabuzz}}. It evolved again into Dragonite when {{TP|Red|Clefairy}} pulled its tail.

===Pokémon Zensho===
In [[PZ06]], {{Zensho|Satoshi}} found a Dratini while [[fishing]] in the {{safari|Kanto}}. Soon afterwards, he [[trade]]d it to a {{tc|Fisher}}man in exchange for several {{type|Water}} Pokémon and the [[Baoba|Safari Zone Warden]]'s [[Gold Teeth|missing dentures]].

==In the TCG==
{{main|Dratini (TCG)}}

==In the TFG==
One Dratini figure has been released:
* {{TFG|Next Quest}}: {{TFG ID|Next Quest|Dratini|9}}

==Trivia==
* In early English-language promotional material for [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue]], Dratini was referred to as "Dragoon". Although this word can mean a European military unit that is transported on horseback but fights on foot, the name was probably selected as a combination of ''dragon'' and ''lagoon''.
* In [[Generation I]] and [[Generation II]], Dratini and Dragonair can learn {{m|Hyper Beam}} via leveling up, but not via [[TM]]. This was fixed in {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}}.
* Dratini and its evolved forms share their {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Horsea}}, its evolved forms, {{p|Salamence}}, and [[Regional form|Kalosian]] {{p|Goodra}}. They are all known as the Dragon Pokémon.
* Dratini was [[List of references to Pokémon in science|the inspiration for the naming]] of ''Hedruris dratini'', a species of parasitic {{wp|nematode}}.<ref>[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-helminthology/article/new-species-of-hedruris-nematoda-hedruridae-from-freshwater-turtles-its-life-cycle-and-biogeographic-distribution-of-the-genus/4E8BB55B37F233B5EBBDD818528D8A72 A new species of Hedruris (Nematoda: Hedruridae) from freshwater turtles, its life cycle and biogeographic distribution of the genus]</ref><ref>[https://twitter.com/JHelminthology/status/1210384215461642245 Tweet from @JHelminthology]</ref>

===Origin===
Dratini appears to be based on {{wp|sea serpent}}s or ''ryu'', traditional {{wp|Japanese dragon}}s or {{wp|Chinese dragon}}s who bring good luck. Its constant growth is similar to that of snakes, who grow as long as they live. Additionally, its reclusive nature, aquatic habitat, and the fact that, for a long time, it was considered a myth are reminiscent of the {{wp|Loch Ness Monster}}.

====Name origin====
Dratini may be a combination of ''{{wp|dragon}}'' and ''teeny'', ''tiny'', or ''mini''.

Miniryu may be a combination of ''miniature'' and 竜 ''ryū'' (dragon).
