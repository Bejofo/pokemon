'''Alakazam''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''フーディン''' ''Foodin'') is a {{type|Psychic}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Kadabra}} when [[Trade Evolution|traded]] or when exposed to a [[Linking Cord]]. It is the final form of {{p|Abra}}.

(Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for more details.)

Alakazam can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Alakazam''' using the [[Alakazite]].

==Biology==
Alakazam is a slightly {{wp|humanoid}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a large mustache. A female Alakazam has a significantly shorter mustache than a male. It has a long, thin snout, narrow eyes, ear-like spikes extending from the top of its head, and an additional spike protruding from each cheek. Covering its yellow, skeletal body are brown armor-like sections over its chest, shoulders, forearms, and knees. There are three toes on each foot, each of which has a white claw. Two of the toes face forward, while one faces backward. It wields a silver spoon in each hand, which act as amplifiers for its psychic abilities. The spoons are created using its psychic powers, and it may give one to someone it trusts. According to its [[Pokémon Ultra Moon]] Pokédex entry, anything eaten with the spoon becomes delicious.

Alakazam is able to use all forms of psychic abilities, including telekinesis and {{m|Shadow Ball|blasts of offensive energy}}. The overflow of its psychic powers can cause headaches to those nearby. These powers are used to move its body, as opposed to its weak muscles. It also uses its psychic powers to hold up its head, which is too heavy to be supported by its neck. Due to its continually growing brain, its head becomes larger with age. It is said to have an excellent memory and can {{wp|Eidetic memory|remember everything that it has experienced}} since hatching as an {{p|Abra}}, to the time of its death, and has an IQ that exceeds 5,000. It is found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Urban Pokémon|urban areas}}.

Alakazam and its pre-evolved form, {{p|Kadabra}}, are the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Kinesis}}.

===Forms===
Alakazam can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Alakazam.

As Mega Alakazam, its mustache turns white and becomes longer and bushier. It also grows a long, white beard. The armor-like sections become bulkier, and its upper body section becomes slightly shorter to reveal its thin stomach. The ear-like spikes become slightly shorter, and a larger spike forms on top of its head. Additionally, it gains an oval, red organ in the center of its forehead. The organ is said to emit psychic power.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160406143554/http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/pokemon/mega_pokemon/#Mega%20Alakazam | Mega Alakazam | Official Site | Pokémon X and Pokémon Y]</ref> Its lower legs become longer and slimmer, and its feet become skinnier and resemble talons. It gains three additional spoons, for a total of five that it levitates in the air. 

At the cost of its already-low muscular strength, Mega Alakazam's power is entirely converted to pure psychic energy. Mega Alakazam is constantly floating thanks to its psychic powers. It can read the course of a person's entire life with a single glance. Mega Alakazam's red organ allows it to foresee every move an opponent makes and everything else. Its precognition is powerful enough to make an attack completely miss Mega Alakazam.

{{main|Alakazam (TCG)}}

==Trivia==
* Alakazam could be seen as a counterpart to {{p|Machamp}}. They are both the last stage of a three-part evolutionary line, they reach their final stage by [[Trade|trading]], level up at a Medium Slow rate, and they both have a 75% male gender ratio. Also, Alakazam excels at the {{Stat|Special Attack}} stat, while Machamp excels at {{stat|Attack}}. Their evolutionary lines are also next to each other in the National Pokédex. Moreover, a girl in [[Oreburgh City]] will [[List of in-game trades#Diamond Pearl and Platinum|trade]] her Abra for a Machop. Additionally, their base friendship is the same at 70, and all Pokémon in both of their respective evolutionary lines are in the Human-Like Egg Group. Finally, while Alakazam has a Mega Evolution, Machamp has a [[Gigantamax]] form.
** Alakazam could also be seen as a counterpart to {{p|Gengar}}. They are both the last stage of a three-part evolutionary line, which can only be achieved by trading, both have Mega Evolutions, Gengar is weak against Psychic moves and Alakazam is weak against Ghost moves, so they are weak and at the same time strong against each other. They have the same length, and both get smaller when they Mega Evolve. Their base friendship is also the same, with 70. In ''[[EP072|The Ancient Puzzle of Pokémopolis]]'', there are a Gengar and an Alakazam put against each other. Since Generation VI, they both have a base stat total of 500. Both are weak to Dark-type Moves. They also have the same stat structure throughout their Evolutions, always having high Speed and Special Attack, and being very low in Physical Defense and still relatively low in Special Defense, HP, and Physical Attack.
* Alakazam was the only Pokémon whose [[Base stats|base stat total]] does not increase by exactly 100 points upon [[Mega Evolution]], gaining instead only 90 points overall. This only applied to it in [[Generation VI]] because Mega Alakazam received another 10 points in its Special Defense in [[Generation VII]].
** Because some form of Alakazam had its {{stat|Special Defense}} raised in both Generation VI and Generation VII, Alakazam is the only Pokémon whose base stats changed more than once after [[Generation II]].
* Alakazam has the lowest average [[performance]] of any fully evolved Pokémon.
* In {{2v2|Red|Blue}}, an Alakazam sent out by an opponent while the player's Pokémon has low health will have the cry of a {{p|Gastly}}.
* In {{2v2|HeartGold|SoulSilver}}, Alakazam is the same height as {{ga|Ethan}}.

===Origin===
Alakazam appears to be based on a {{wp|Magician (fantasy)|magician}} and also a {{wp|Spoon bending|spoon bender}}. It also shares similarities to {{wp|foxes}}, animals mythologically tied to magic. The combination of human body, horns, ties to magic, and five-pointed star-shaped head similar to {{wp|pentagram}} make it similar to {{wp|Baphomet}}.  As it created the spoons with its psychic powers, it may be based on the practice of {{wp|alchemy}}, an early science that sought to synthesize metals with magic. Its horns, talons, and long mustache are also reminiscent of {{wp|Chinese dragon}}s, which similarly are considered miraculous beings.

Mega Alakazam appears to be based on a {{wp|sorcerer}} or {{wp|wizard}}, or possibly {{wp|sadhu}}s with psychic powers.

====Name origin====
Alakazam's name is derived from ''alakazam'', an incantation used in {{wp|magic (illusion)|stage magic}} similar to ''{{wp|abracadabra}}''.

Foodin may be named after ''{{wp|Harry Houdini}}'', a famed illusionist and escape artist.
