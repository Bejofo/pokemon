'''Golem''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ゴローニャ''' ''Golonya'') is a dual-type {{2t|Rock|Ground}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Graveler}} when [[Trade Evolution|traded]] or when exposed to a [[Linking Cord]]. It is the final form of {{p|Geodude}}.

In [[Alola]], Golem has a dual-type {{2t|Rock|Electric}} [[regional form]]. It evolves from {{rf|Alolan}} Graveler when traded. It is the final form of Alolan Geodude. These Golem can also be found in [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]]. 

(Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for more details.)

==Biology==
Golem is a bipedal tortoise-like {{wp|boulder}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a spherical body covered by a shell of plated, green rocks. Its body is {{a|Sturdy|so hard}} that even dynamite cannot scratch it. Its head protrudes from the center of the shell. The head has a flat snout with two pointed teeth in the lower jaw and red eyes. It has short arms that have three claws and two legs with feet that have four claws in front and one in back. The head and limbs are light brown. 

Golem grows bigger by shedding its skin once a year. The discarded shell immediately hardens when exposed to air, crumbling away and returning to the soil. Farmers are known to collect Golem's shells. Golem's soil is spread across fields to promote crop growth. However, it stops shedding with age and moss grows over its shell. As shown in the [[Bandai Pokémon Carddass Cards]], Golem's shell is hollow, despite it looking like it is not.

As shown in ''[[EP036|The Bridge Bike Gang]]'', Golem can withdraw its head and limbs into its shell and roll at high speeds. It is dangerous when doing this, as it is unable to see and may crash into or run over anything in its path. To prevent it from rolling into the homes of people downhill, grooves are dug into the sides of the mountains to divert the rolling Golem's course. It is seldom seen in the wild, but may rarely be sighted in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Mountain Pokémon|mountainous}} regions. Golem are known to detonate their own body. It uses this explosive force to jump from mountain to mountain. As mentioned in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Golem is known to occasionally sleep upside down.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref> It is believed that Golem rocks itself into a deep slumber, similar to a cradle. However, there's a chance a sleeping Golem may roll into anyone nearby it, hence why it is best to stay clear of Golem while it sleeps.

===Forms===
Golem has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Alolan}} Golem.

In the [[Alola]] region, Golem has shorter forearms with two claws. The feet have only two claws as well. Its face attracts iron sand, creating the appearance of a mustache, eyebrows, and a large black beard. Jutting out of the top of its body are two large, black rocks with a smaller rock in between, forming the shape of a cannon. On the inner edge of the larger rocks are three golden dots. 

The cannon prevents them from easily rolling into a ball like its Kantonian variant. Alolan Golem has a grumpy and stubborn personality. Should anyone make Alolan Golem upset, it will roar with a voice similar to thunder, discharging electricity from its body at the same time. Alolan Golem is capable of firing the small rock by using magnetism. The rock will be electrically charged, creating shocks across the whole area of impact.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170919102848/http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/alolan-golem | Alolan Golem (Archived)]</ref> Numbness and fainting can occur with even a glancing blow. If rocks are not available, it will fire nearby {{p|Geodude}} instead. They can also be found in the [[Canyon Biome]] of [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]], where Alola's island life is simulated.

Alolan Golem and its pre-evolved forms are the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Galvanize}} as an [[Ability]].

===Evolution===
Golem evolves from {{p|Graveler}} and is the final form of {{p|Geodude}}.

{{rf|Alolan}} Golem has a dual-type {{2t|Rock|Electric}} [[regional form]]. It evolves from Alolan Graveler and is the final form of Alolan Geodude.

One Golem figure has been released.

* {{TFG|Next Quest}}: {{TFG ID|Next Quest|Golem|16}}

==In the TCG==
{{main|Golem (TCG)}}

==Trivia==
* In {{game2|Red|Blue|Yellow}}, Golem is the only Pokémon that cannot ever be seen without [[Trade|trading]].
** A hint to its existence can be found in the English versions of these games, where an [[Non-player character|NPC]] at the [[Celadon Department Store]] receives his friend's {{p|Graveler}} via trade and mentions it [[Evolution|evolving]]. In the Japanese version, the NPC speaks of his new {{p|Haunter}} evolving into a {{p|Gengar}} instead.
***However, since Golem can be obtained in Japanese Blue by trading Kadabra for Graveler in an in game trade at Cinnabar Lab, this does not hold true for the Japanese Gen 1 games.
** Either {{p|Electabuzz}} or {{p|Magmar}} (depending on the version), {{p|Kabutops}} or {{p|Omastar}} (depending on which [[Fossil]] the player chose) and {{p|Venusaur}} (if the player started with {{p|Charmander}} in Red and Blue or locked themselves out of {{p|Bulbasaur}} in Yellow) can be other Pokémon that cannot ever be seen, but only Golem is definitely missable.
** The remakes, {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}}, have a [[Ruin Maniac]] in [[Ruin Valley]] with a Golem, making it no longer impossible to see without trading.
* Golem's evolutionary line shares similarities with {{p|Gigalith}}'s evolutionary line. Both of them are {{type|Rock}}; have {{a|Sturdy}} as one of their {{Abilities}}; learn {{m|Stealth Rock}}, {{m|Smack Down}}, {{m|Explosion}}, {{m|Stone Edge}}, and {{m|Rock Blast}} by level-up; first evolve at level 25; and then reach the final evolutionary stage by [[trade|trading]].
* Golem's evolutionary line is the only three-stage evolutionary line in which all members have a [[regional form]].
* Alolan Golem has the highest base {{stat|Defense}} stat of all {{type|Electric}} Pokémon.
* Alolan Golem and its evolutionary relatives were designed by [[Hitoshi Ariga]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/ariga_megamix/status/804500572967555072 Tweet by ありがひとし/ArigaHitoshi (@ariga_megamix).] Posted on December 2, 2016.</ref>
* {{p|Burmy}}, {{p|Wormadam}}, {{p|Mothim}}, {{p|Geodude}}, {{p|Graveler}} and Golem are the only Pokémon in all five [[List of Pokémon by Hisui Pokédex number|Hisui Pokédex]] sublistings.
* In [[Generation IX]], Alolan Golem is unable to learn {{m|High Horsepower}} via [[TM]], while its pre-Evolutions can.

===Design variations===
{{main|Pokémon controversies#Four-fingered hands|Pokémon controversies → Four-fingered hands}}

===Origin===
Golem, as the name suggests, may be based on a {{wp|golem}}, an earth type {{wp|elemental}} creature, more specifically on representations in modern {{wp|role-playing game}}s, which usually are {{wp|ogre}}-like creatures whose bodies are covered in, or made of, stones. It could also have been inspired by the tsuchikorobi, a Japanese {{wp|yōkai}} known as the 'tumbling monster', for its habit of rolling over travelers and crushing them, as Golem does.

It might also be based on {{wp|tortoise}}s, which are believed to hold the world on their backs in many myths, including the {{wp|Hindu mythology|Hindu}}, {{wp|Chinese mythology|Chinese}}, and {{wp|Mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American mythologies}}. Its "shell" may represent the {{wp|Plate tectonics|tectonic plates}} of Earth. It also resembles {{wp|Concretion#Septarian_concretions|septarian nodules}}, also known as "turtle stones."

Alolan Golem, like its predecessors, seems to have structures made of {{wp|Piezoelectricity#Materials|piezoelectric crystals}} or {{wp|magnetite}}, a subset of iron ore known for its black crystalline appearance and magnetic properties. The black structure on its back may be derived from an {{wp|electroshock weapon}} or a {{wp|railgun}}. This iron ore takes shape of a Golem's {{wp|beard}} and {{wp|eyebrows}}.

====Name origin====
Golem is literally ''golem''.

Golonya may be a combination of ゴロンゴロン ''goron-goron'' (onomatopoeia of rolling rocks) and ''montagna'' (Italian for ''mountain'').
