'''Slowbro''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ヤドラン''' ''Yadoran'') is a dual-type {{2t|Water|Psychic}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s from {{p|Slowpoke}} starting at [[level]] 37. It is one of Slowpoke's final forms, the other being {{p|Slowking}}.

Slowbro can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Slowbro''' using the [[Slowbronite]].

In [[Galar]], Slowbro has a dual-type {{2t|Poison|Psychic}} [[regional form]], introduced in {{g|Sword and Shield}}'s 1.2.0 patch. It evolves from {{rf|Galarian}} Slowpoke when exposed to a [[Galarica Cuff]]. It is one of Galarian Slowpoke's final forms, the other being Galarian Slowking. These Slowbro can also be found in [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]].

==Biology==
Slowbro is a bipedal, pink {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a tan, striped belly and a rounded, tan muzzle. It has large, vacant eyes, curled ears, and two small pointed teeth protruding from its upper jaw. It has three clawed fingers on its hands and two clawed toes on its feet. There is a {{p|Shellder}} attached to its tail. This Shellder has a gray, spiral shell with darker gray spots and small, triangular eyes near the base. There are several spikes across the surface of the Shellder, and it holds onto Slowbro with many sharp teeth. Shellder developed its spiral form in an effort to suck more sweetness out of Slowbro's tail. If its tail or the Shellder attached to it is broken off, Slowbro will [[Devolution|revert]] to its unevolved form, {{p|Slowpoke}}.

Slowbro has lost the capability to feel pain due to the Shellder's poison. While typically lazy and unintelligent, Slowbro apparently becomes inspired when the Shellder bites down on its tail. While it is capable of unleashing powerful psychic attacks, Slowbro is typically rather peaceful and usually prefers not to fight. Because it can no longer fish using its tail, it instead swims to catch its prey and allows the Shellder to feed on its leftover scraps. Slowbro tends to live near {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Water's-edge Pokémon|ponds, lakes, and seashores}}. As mentioned in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Slowbro usually sleeps at the same time as the Shellder biting its tail. On occasion, Slowbro sleeps even when Shellder is still awake.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref>

===Forms===
Slowbro has a [[regional form]], {{rf|Galarian}} Slowbro, and can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Slowbro.

;Galarian Slowbro
In [[Galar]], Slowbro's appearance differs due to Shellder biting its arm instead of its tail, causing a chemical reaction between the Shellder's poison and the consumed [[Galarica Twig|Galarica]] spices within the Slowpoke's body.<ref name=SwShsite /> The Shellder attached to its arm resembles the Shellder tail of its Kantonian counterpart, but is smaller, with a purple tip shaped like a stinger, and lacking visible pupils. Galarian Slowbro itself has a slight color difference compared to its counterpart, being pinker, with purple accents on its head, arms, and tail.

Galarian Slowbro is considered highly dangerous for its tendency to indiscriminately attack its surroundings, the reason for which is due to its Shellder sometimes unconsciously biting down hard on its arm. Another reason is that Shellder feels bliss when biting hard enough to absorb Galarian Slowbro's poison. However, Shellder will occasionally faint from the seeping poison, and Galarian Slowbro occasionally lashes out due to the itching caused by said poison. While normally zoned out, when facing a strong opponent its body becomes stimulated, and it will sport a sharper expression. Galarian Slowbro attacks by grabbing at its Shellder's tongue, causing the Shellder to fire poisonous liquids from its tip. It attacks at speeds rivaling the quickest of known reflexes.<ref name=SwShsite>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/expansionpass/pokemon/galarian-slowbro/ Galarian Slowbro | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref> They can also be found in the [[Coastal Biome]] of [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]], where Galar's regional life is simulated.

Galarian Slowbro is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Shell Side Arm}}. It is also the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Quick Draw}} as an [[Ability]].

;Mega Slowbro
As Mega Slowbro, it becomes engulfed by the Shellder so that only its head, arms, and white-tipped tail are visible. Its head pokes out of the Shellder's mouth and is surrounded by the Shellder's enlarged teeth. The Shellder has holes on its sides and an opening at its tip, allowing Mega Slowbro's arms and tail to stick out. Mega Slowbro balances on its tail due to its legs being engulfed. 

It can move by bouncing, using its tail as a spring.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150207095015/http://www.pokemonrubysapphire.com/en-us/pokemon/new-mega-evolutions/mega-slowbro Mega Slowbro]</ref> The spikes on the Shellder are now reduced to four on the bottom section of its body and the dark spare dots are only visible on its middle section. Mega Slowbro's energy has gathered into Shellder, which has increased its hardness. This allows it to act as {{a|Shell Armor|armor so hard}} that nothing can scratch it. The Slowbro inside is virtually unchanged, but it gains some power and motivation from Shellder's digestive fluids.

{{main|Slowbro (UNITE)}}

{{-}}

==Trivia==
* Despite it being a commonly known and accepted fact that {{p|Shellder}} triggers its [[Evolution]], mentioned in most of its [[Pokédex entry|Pokédex entries]], Slowbro's Evolution from Slowpoke has nothing to do with Shellder in the [[core series]], unlike how the Evolution of {{p|Mantyke}} requires a {{p|Remoraid}}.
{{bulbanews|Mega Audino and Slowbro revealed}}
* Mega Slowbro was first accidentally revealed on the official Korean Pokémon website on August 12, 2014, two days prior to its official release by [[Junichi Masuda]].
* [[Mega Evolution|Mega]] Slowbro is tied with {{p|Cloyster}} for the highest base {{stat|Defense}} stat of all {{type|Water}} Pokémon.
** Slowbro's tail has an attached Shellder — the pre-evolved form of Cloyster — which grows to engulf it during Mega Evolution. This may have been an intended parallel.
** Mega Slowbro also has the highest base {{stat|Defense}} stat of all {{type|Psychic}} Pokémon.
* Slowbro's Pokédex entries state that if the Shellder is removed, it will revert to a Slowpoke. This is a rare example of [[devolution]] being mentioned in the games.
* Slowbro and {{p|Raichu}} are the only Pokémon to have both a Mega Evolution and a regional form.
** In {{g|GO}}, which features both, {{rf|Galarian}} Slowbro cannot Mega Evolve.
* Slowbro, its Galarian form, and their evolutionary relatives are the only Psychic-type Pokémon in the {{egg3|Monster}}.
* Galarian Slowbro and its evolutionary relative, Galarian {{p|Slowking}}, are the only {{DL|List of Pokémon by color|pink}} {{type|Poison}} Pokémon.

===Origin===
{{bulbanews|On the Origin of Species: Slowpoke, Slowbro and Slowking}}
Slowbro's physical appearance may be loosely based on {{wp|hippopotamus}}es, {{wp|giant otter}}s, and {{wp|giant salamander}}s. Slowbro's shell and lifestyle may also be based on {{wp|hermit crab}}s, further supported by its {{pkmn|category}} as the Hermit Crab Pokémon.  It also shares similarities with the mythical {{wp|sazae-oni}}, a magical sea demon of Japanese folklore distinguished by its {{wp|Turbo sazae|spiny turban snail shell}}.

Mega Slowbro's upright and balanced stance may draw inspiration from an early ''{{wp|beigoma}}'', a Japanese spinning top originally made from a sea snail shell (notably the {{wp|Babylonia japonica|Japanese ivory shell}}) stuffed with sand or clay.

Galarian Slowbro's {{type|Poison}} might draw inspiration from {{wp|cone snail}}s, which have cone-shaped shells and are highly venomous. The shell's position on Slowbro's arm and use for ranged attacks resembles depictions of arm cannons in fiction.

====Name origin====
Slowbro may be a combination of ''slow'' and ''bro'' (short for ''brother''). 

Yadoran may involve 宿借り ''yadokari'' ({{wp|hermit crab}}), 宿主 ''yadonushi'' (parasitic host), and 鈍 ''don'' (dull). According to {{wp|Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian}} singer-songwriter {{wp|Jadranka Stojaković}}, Yadoran was named after her first name (transliterated as ヤドランカ ''Yadoranka'' in Japanese). Stojaković had worked for {{wp|Konami}} during her residence in Japan, and a former colleague of hers who later joined [[Game Freak]] brought her name to mind while naming Yadoran.<ref>[https://radiosarajevo.ba/metromahala/lica/jadranka-stojakovic-vratila-sam-se-definitivno/54320 Jadranka Stojaković: Vratila sam se definitivno / Radio Sarajevo] ''in Bosnian''</ref>
