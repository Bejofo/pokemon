'''Giratina''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ギラティナ''' ''Giratina'') is a dual-type {{2t|Ghost|Dragon}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation IV]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Giratina transforms from its standard [[#Form data|form]], called its '''Altered Forme''', into a second form, called its '''Origin Forme''', while either holding a [[Griseous Orb]] ([[Generation IV]] to [[Generation VIII]]), a [[Griseous Core]] (Generation VIII onward), or while in its home, the [[Distortion World]].

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Form data|Game data&rarr;Form data]] for these details.)

Giratina's Origin Forme was officially revealed in early February 2008.

Giratina is the [[game mascot]] of {{game|Platinum}}, appearing on the boxart in its Origin Forme.

Along with {{p|Dialga}} and {{p|Palkia}}, it is one of the [[Pokémon of myth]], representing {{wp|antimatter}}.

==Biology==
[[File:487Giratina XY anime.png|thumb|left|200px|Altered Forme Giratina's wings shaped into claws]]
Giratina is a large gray draconic {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with three gold half-rings on each side of its long neck. Its head has a gold crown-like object surrounding it with two large horns pointing sideways. A thick black stripe runs vertically along its front with five red horizontal stripes. In its Altered Forme, it has two large black ghostly wings with three red tips on each that can resemble claws. These wings can change shape as if made of a liquid or gas. Its six legs are thick and have golden claws. Two golden half-circles similar to those on its neck are on each side of each leg, resembling shackles. It has a tail with two band-like markings.

According to the [[Sinnoh myths|myths and legends]] of the [[Hisui]]/[[Sinnoh]] [[region]], in the beginning of existence, the [[Mythical Pokémon]] {{p|Arceus}} created the [[Pokémon egg|eggs]] in which the Pokémon of antimatter–Giratina, the Pokémon of time–{{p|Dialga}}, and the Pokémon of space–{{p|Palkia}}, hatched from, all three in their {{form|Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina|Origin Formes}}. After the [[Pokémon universe]] was created, due to Giratina's violent nature, Arceus banished it to the [[Distortion World]], a world that lies on the reverse side of the [[Pokémon world]]. Since then, Giratina carried a strong grudge against its creator Arceus and was willing to stand against it with the help of a [[human]] named [[Volo]], but after being defeated by a [[Player character|human from another time]] and fleeing, it would change its ways to protect the {{pkmn|universe}} from threats such as [[Cyrus]], who had a similar goal to its former partner.

Giratina is highly aggressive and territorial, likely other reasons for its banishment. It has been reported to appear in ancient [[Death in the Pokémon world#Burial grounds|cemeteries]]. Giratina has the power to tear holes in reality, sometimes even creating a [[space-time distortion|space-time rift]], being so big and powerful that it can even throw both Dialga and Palkia into a frenzy. This rift might also spread smaller [[space-time distortion]]s all over the region it was created in, creating [[Alpha Pokémon]] and releasing bolts of lightning that throw [[noble Pokémon]] into a frenzy. It is also capable of {{m|Shadow Force|cloaking itself in darkness as it attacks}}. It generally moves by levitating itself in the air, as opposed to walking on its six legs. Giratina is said to be equal in strength to its siblings Dialga and Palkia. 

Giratina is said to have observed the real world silently while in its home dimension. It remains in its Altered Forme while outside of its home [[dimension]]. Unlike in the games, [[Pokémon movie]]s depict Giratina only opening portals through reflective surfaces. Giratina also had many different titles throughout the years: "the banished Pokémon", "Arceus's shadow", "the Pokémon of Shadows", and "the being on the other side of our world". 

Giratina is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Shadow Force}} by leveling up.

===Forms===
[[File:487Giratina Origin Forme Dream 3.png|thumb|200px|Origin Forme Giratina's plate mask opened]]
Giratina can change between its Altered Forme and Origin Forme.

Compared to Palkia and Dialga, both of which resemble Arceus in their Origin Formes, Giratina's Origin Forme takes on a serpentine look. Its legs are reduced to golden-tipped spikes, and four additional golden spikes appear near the edge of its tail. While in Origin Forme, the six gold half-rings can grip objects. The back points of each half-ring have a black ghostly tendril with a red spike at its tip. The horns on its head are now facing the back. The sides of the golden "crown" cover its mouth and separate vertically like an insect's mandible when it opens its mouth. The black vertical stripe is broken into pieces and runs down its body.

The Origin Forme of Giratina is said to be Giratina's true form, capable of traveling through and controlling dimensions besides those of time and space. Giratina can only be in its Origin Forme when in its home, the [[Distortion World]], or when holding either a [[Griseous Orb]] or [[Griseous Core]]. Giratina can also maintain its Origin Forme in the real world without items should it get a sufficient amount of power, enough to potentially be equal to Arceus. Giratina is at its full power when in the Origin Forme, and is always levitated in this state. When in its Origin Forme, it can pass through dimensions at will, although it will turn back to its Altered Forme due to the gravity change from the Distortion World. Giratina has the power to turn itself into a shadow and to merge the Distortion World with the [[Pokémon world]], as seen during the events of [[Spear Pillar]]. However, this has the dangerous side effect of distorting it to the risk of being destroyed. In [[Pokémon Adventures]], Giratina was shown to be capable of using the terrain of the Distortion World to encase and trap its targets.

===NPC appearances===
* {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}}: Giratina is the guardian of the [[Seven Treasures|Rock Horn]].
* [[Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon]]: An illusion of Giratina is used by {{p|Solosis}} and {{p|Litwick}} when battling the children of [[Serene Village]] inside [[Ancient Barrow]]. The real Giratina appears as the guardian of the [[Looplet|Grass Looplet]] in the [[Grass Continent]]'s [[Zero Isle]].
* [[Pokémon Legends: Arceus]]: [[Turnback Cave#Special encounters|Giratina]] is one of the major antagonists and boss of the game. It is one of {{ga|Arceus}}'s creations alongside {{p|Dialga}} and {{p|Palkia}}. In anger for being banished to the [[Distortion World]] by Arceus, it partnered up with a [[human]] named [[Volo]] and tore open a [[Space-time distortion|rift in space-time]] above [[Mount Coronet]] to try and force Arceus out of hiding.

* In [[Generation IV]] only, when Giratina is in its {{form|Giratina|Origin Forme}} due to holding the [[Griseous Orb]], it cannot have its [[Ability]] changed by any means (such as {{m|Skill Swap}} or {{m|Worry Seed}}). Giratina's Ability can still be copied (by {{a|Trace}} or {{m|Role Play}}) or suppressed by {{m|Gastro Acid}}. This effect is unrelated with the Ability itself. Giratina can still have its Ability changed when it is in {{form|Giratina|Altered Forme}}.

===Form data===
Along with the other members of the [[Pokémon of myth]], Giratina has the ability to switch to a second form: Origin Forme. However, Giratina is unique in that its standard form is called Altered Forme.

Giratina's Altered Forme debuted in {{game|Diamond and Pearl|s}}, while its Origin Forme was introduced in {{game|Platinum}}. From Platinum to {{pkmn|Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl}}, it transforms into its Origin Forme while holding a [[Griseous Orb]]. In Platinum, it also transforms into its Origin Forme while in the [[Distortion World]]. In {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, it changes between its forms when exposed to a [[Griseous Core]]. In {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, Giratina transforms into its Origin Forme while holding a Griseous Core. If it is deposited in {{g|HOME}}, it will revert to its Altered Forme.

In {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky}}, Giratina will appear in its Origin Forme while in the version-exclusive dungeons. In {{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}}, Giratina will cycle through Formes after being used in a dungeon.

{{Evobox/Formes
|name1=Giratina
|sprite1=0487Giratina
|forme1=Altered Forme
|loc1=Default form
|type1-1=Ghost
|type2-1=Dragon
|sprite2=0487Giratina-Origin
|forme2=Origin Forme
|loc2={{color2|000|Distortion World}} or {{color2|000|Held item|holding}} a {{color2|000|Griseous Core}}
|item1=Griseous Core
|itemfile1=Bag Griseous Core SV Sprite.png
|itemsize1=40px
}}

The forms differ in their [[base stats]]: Giratina's Origin Forme has its {{stat|Defense}} and {{stat|Special Defense}} switched with its {{stat|Attack}} and {{stat|Special Attack}} (its base stat total is unchanged). In Legends: Arceus, its [[signature move]], {{m|Shadow Force}}, has modified base power and accuracy when used by its Origin Forme, as well as a unique animation.

In Explorers of Sky, as the Pokémon's stats are calculated differently, the forms instead apply stat stage modifiers, with Altered Forme receiving -2 to its Attack and Special Attack, and +2 to its Defense and Special Defense, with those being swapped for Origin Forme. However, in the Japanese version only, the Defense stat modifiers are instead erroneously applied to the target Giratina is facing, making Altered Forme weaker than intended and Origin Forme stronger than intended.

[[File:Giratina Origin Forme anime.png|thumb|250px|Origin Forme Giratina in {{aniseries|PTS}}]]
====Major appearances====
=====[[Giratina (movie)]]=====
Giratina debuted in ''[[M11|Giratina and the Sky Warrior]]'', where it sought revenge against {{mov|Dialga}} for the damage it caused to its home, the [[Reverse World]], during its {{pkmn|battle}} with {{mov|Palkia}} in ''[[M10|The Rise of Darkrai]]''. [[Zero]] later attempted to copy Giratina's powers so he could conquer the Reverse World. Throughout the {{pkmn|movie}}, Giratina would take on its Origin Forme whenever it is in the Reverse World, and its Altered Forme whenever it is in the real world.

In ''[[M12|Arceus and the Jewel of Life]]'', Giratina was shown for the first time with both the other members of [[Pokémon of myth|its trio]]. It resumed its attack on Dialga, but was finally calmed down through the intervention of {{Ash}} and [[Sheena]]. It later joined forces with Dialga and Palkia to fight {{OBP|Arceus|M12}}.

=====Other=====
In ''[[M18|Hoopa and the Clash of Ages]]'', Giratina was one of six [[Legendary Pokémon]] summoned and hypnotized by the shadow {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Hoopa|Hoopa Unbound}} as its reinforcements. It and its teammates engaged in a battle against the {{p|Latios}}, {{p|Latias}}, and {{Shiny}} {{p|Rayquaza}} summoned to protect the real {{an|Hoopa}} in [[Dahara City]]. Eventually, after the shadow Hoopa was sealed in a [[Prison Bottle]], the hypnosis on Giratina and the other Legendary Pokémon was lifted, and Giratina departed for its home. It appeared in both of its formes.

====Minor appearances====
Giratina made its animated series debut in ''[[DP148|Try for the Family Stone!]]'' as an illusion that was created by {{OBP|Mitchell|DP148}}'s {{p|Murkrow}}.

In ''[[DP173|Dealing With a Fierce Double Ditto Drama!]]'', {{MTR}}'s [[boss fantasy]] featured Giratina.

===Pokémon Generations===
[[File:Giratina Altered Forme PG.png|thumb|left|250px|Altered Forme Giratina in [[Pokémon Generations]]]]
[[File:Giratina Origin Forme PG.png|thumb|250px|Origin Forme Giratina in Pokémon Generations]]
In ''[[PG11|The New World]]'', Giratina interfered with [[Cyrus]]'s plan to destroy the world and recreate it. It first emerged from the [[Distortion World]] to free {{p|Dialga}} and {{p|Palkia}} from the [[Red Chain]]. Then, it took Cyrus with it back to its homeworld. It was last seen in its {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Giratina|Origin Forme}}, observing Cyrus as he regained consciousness, realized he was in the Distortion World, and accepted it as the new world he sought.

===GOTCHA!===
A Giratina briefly appeared in its Origin Forme as a silhouette in [[GOTCHA!]].

==Other appearances==
===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U]]===
[[File:Giratina SSB4.png|220px|thumb|left|Giratina in Super Smash Bros. for 3DS]]
Altered Forme Giratina appears as a {{i|Poké Ball}} summon. It uses {{m|Dragon Breath}} to cause a whirlwind. It also causes damage on contact.

Altered Forme Giratina also appears as a trophy in both versions of the game.

====Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''This {{t|Ghost}}/{{type|Dragon}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} is a resident of the [[Distortion World]]. When it is given a [[Griseous Orb]], it'll change into its Origin Forme. Its {{m|Dragon Breath}} attack can catch fighters in a powerful, damaging tornado. If you're on the receiving end, be careful it doesn't carry you right off the stage''

[[File:Giratina SSBU.png|thumb|250px|Giratina in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]
'''PAL''': ''Also called the Renegade Pokémon, Giratina lives in a [[dimension]] known as the Distortion World. It has two forms, and will only be seen in its Origin Forme in our world if it's holding a Griseous Orb. Its Dragon Breath attack creates a powerful tornado that not only damages you, but can carry you off the stage!''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Giratina returns as a Poké Ball summon, retaining its behavior from the previous game. Giratina cannot be summoned on Balloon Fight, Brinstar, Corneria, Dream Land GB, Golden Plains, Green Hill Zone, Jungle Japes, Living Room, Mute City SNES, Reset Bomb Forest, Suzaku Castle, Tomodachi Life, Tortimer Island, WarioWare Inc., or Yoshi's Island. It also appears as two {{sbw|Spirits}}, one in its Altered Forme, which can be enhanced into its Origin Forme.

==Trivia==
[[File:Origin Forme Giratina Encounter Pt.png|thumb|Origin Forme Giratina in the [[Distortion World]] in {{game|Platinum}}]]
[[File:Altered Forme Giratina Encounter Pt.png|thumb|Altered Forme Giratina at [[Turnback Cave]] in Pokémon Platinum]]
* Giratina has many differences from the other members of [[Pokémon of myth|its trio]]:
** In {{v2|Platinum}}, it has its own unique battle music, can change forms between {{form|Giratina|Altered Forme and Origin Forme}}, and has two different menu sprites.
** It is the only member without any double resistances.
** Its {{stat|HP}} is its highest [[stat]] rather than {{stat|Special Attack}}.
** It does not have a [[Pokémon of myth orbs|Pokémon of myth orb]] in {{game|Diamond and Pearl|s}} (the [[Griseous Orb]] was introduced in Pokémon Platinum).
** It is met at level 70 in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl while the other members are met at [[level]] 47. This is reversed in Pokémon Platinum.
** It is separated from the other members of its group in the [[Pokédex]] by {{p|Heatran}} and {{p|Regigigas}}.
** It is the only member without a 100% [[Recruitment|recruit rate]] in the {{g|Mystery Dungeon}} series.
** It is the only member whose box art differs from its official art released with Diamond and Pearl.
* Giratina's encounter in the [[Distortion World]] in Pokémon Platinum has several distinctions from other {{pkmn|battle}}s:
** At the start of the battle, it uniquely descends from the top of the screen, and is accompanied by the unique message "The Distortion World's Giratina appeared!". It is still a [[wild Pokémon]] despite the unique message.
** No platform is displayed beneath Giratina, and it does not have a shadow until it uses {{m|Shadow Force}} or breaks out of a [[Poké Ball]].
* Giratina is tied with {{p|Lunala}}, {{form|Necrozma|Dawn Wings}} {{p|Necrozma}}, and {{form|Calyrex|Shadow Rider}} {{p|Calyrex}} for the highest base stat total of all {{type|Ghost}} Pokémon.
** Giratina is tied with {{p|Drifblim}} for the highest base {{stat|HP}} stat of all Ghost-type Pokémon.
* Giratina is the only Legendary Pokémon that can be obtained in all five of the Generation IV [[core series]] handheld games.
* In {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}}, the second frame of Giratina's Altered Forme sprite was changed, but the static sprite remained the same.
** This sprite is also present in Pokémon Platinum's data, but is unused.
* In {{2v2|Black|White|2}}, [[Fantina]] has an Origin Forme Giratina without a Griseous Orb in [[The Battle Between Legendary Pokémon]].
* Altered Forme Giratina is the [[List of Pokémon by weight|heaviest]] Ghost-type Pokémon and the only {{type|Dragon}} Pokémon {{DL|List of Pokémon by shape|Pokémon with tentacles or a multiped body|with a multiped body}}.
** Origin Forme Giratina is both the [[List of Pokémon by height|tallest]] Ghost-type Pokémon and the tallest {{cat|Generation IV Pokémon}}.
* In {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, {{Shiny}} Giratina in its Origin Forme causes a game crash when using {{m|Shadow Force}}. This bug has yet to be fixed.
* The symbols for the {{TCG|Platinum}} expansion [[File:SetSymbolPlatinum.png|30px]] and the {{TCG|Lost Origin}} expansion [[File:SetSymbolLost Origin.png|30px]] resemble Giratina's Origin Forme, seen from the front.

===Origin===
According to [[Junichi Masuda]] and [[Takeshi Kawachimaru]], Giratina and the [[Distortion World]] are personifications of {{wp|antimatter}}.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120924075934/http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/694081/junichi-masuda-takeshi-kawachimaru-talk-pokemon-platinum-particle-physics-bridges-and-more/ Junichi Masuda & Takeshi Kawachimaru Talk 'Pokemon Platinum', Particle Physics, Bridges, And More! - G4tv.com (archived)]</ref>

Giratina may also draw inspiration from {{wp|fallen angel}}s, celestial beings that rebelled against God and were excommunicated to Hell — analogous to Giratina being exiled by {{p|Arceus}} to another [[dimension]] due to its belligerent nature. Furthermore, it might allude to {{wp|Samael}}, who is the ruler of the 5th Heaven and has grim and destructive duties whilst being a member of a heavenly host. 

In its Altered Forme, Giratina resembles a {{wp|European dragon}} or {{wp|sauropod}}. It also shares similarities with some ''{{wp|kaiju}}'' depictions in popular media. Its wings may be based on a bat's, and its body has an insect-like six-legged feature.

Origin Forme Giratina's serpentine body may be based on a {{wp|Chinese dragon}}, an {{wp|Amphiptere}}, or an ''{{wp|Ōmukade|Oomukade}}'', a giant centipede with dragon-like features, said to prey on dragon and be as large as a mountain. It may also be based on a {{wp|Seraph}}, a class of angels known for its six wings and, in some depictions, a serpentine body. Similarly, it also shares some similarities with other serpents or dragon-like creatures in Abrahamic religions, such as the {{wp|Serpents in the Bible#Ancient serpent|ancient serpent}} or the {{wp|Leviathan}}. The design of its six wings may be based on a {{wp|scorpion}}'s stinger or {{wp|spider}} legs.

Additionally, Its {{t|Ghost}} [[type]] may parallel its counterparts' type: {{p|Palkia}} is part {{type|Water}}, and {{p|Dialga}} is part {{type|Steel}} — all three may reference the three primary {{wp|State of matter|states of matter}}; gas, liquid, and solid.

====Name origin====
Giratina may be derived from ''platina'' (Spanish for ''platinum''). It may also involve ''guilty'', ''{{wp|guillotine}}'', ギラリ ''girari'' (onomatopoeia for glaring), and possibly ''girasol'' (a type of {{wp|opal}}).
