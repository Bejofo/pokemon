'''Basculegion'''  ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''イダイトウ''' ''Idaitou'') is a dual-type {{2t|Water|Ghost}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced during [[Generation VIII]], in {{g|Legends: Arceus}}.

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from [[Basculin (Pokémon)#Form data|White-Striped]] {{p|Basculin}} when [[level]]ed up after losing at least 294 [[HP]] from [[Recoil|recoil damage]] without fainting.

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for these details.)

==Biology==
Basculegion is a large, green, fish-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. It has a jagged mouth with pointed teeth. Its spine is aligned with a dark gray line, with colored stripes that flank it on either side and extend around its gills, along with spots scattered across its body. These accents are red in male Basculegion, and light blue in female Basculegion. Their eyes also match the appropriate color, and they look fierce on males and drowsy or sad on females. It has a pair of white pectoral fins, a three-spiked dorsal fin, and a two-spiked ventral fin. Additional smoke-like features cover Basculegion's face in a manner resembling {{wp|Barbel (anatomy)|barbels}}; female Basculegion sport shorter ones and lack the two small fins that the males have on their chin, instead having more blue markings around their lips and eyes.

Basculegion's [[Evolution]] is achieved by a White-Striped Basculin being possessed by the souls of other Basculin in its school who did not survive their harsh journey swimming upstream. These souls wrap around Basculegion's body, particularly along its rear half. They are colored red on male Basculegion, said to be caused by the souls' rage; and light blue on female Basculegion, whose paleness resulted from the sadness within the souls. When it senses danger, Basculegion will turn hostile and attack along with its souls until the enemy is defeated. The souls within Basculegion are said to have a will of their own and provide Basculegion with the power needed to swim on without tiring.<ref>[https://legends.arceus.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon/basculegion/ Basculegion | Pokémon Legends: Arceus Official Website]</ref>The souls enable Basculegion to navigate even the most turbulent rapids with ease. Male Basculegion are known for their powerful jumps, while female Basculegion can conjure and control terrifying illusions against its opponents. Basculegion is said to have no equal in the rivers of the [[Hisui]] region. In the present day, it's only known to be found in [[Kitakami]]'s [[Timeless Woods]] along with its pre-evolved form.

A special male Basculegion is worshiped in [[Hisui]] due to being a descendant of one of the 10 ancient Pokémon who received a blessing from {{p|Arceus}}. In particular, it is one of the {{hi|Ride Pokémon}} who resides in [[Cobalt Coastlands]], watched over by the [[warden]] [[Iscan]]. This special male Basculegion is known to assist humans. This ride Basculegion can dash and can leap over anything by jumping up twice.

===Evolution===
Basculegion evolves from White-Striped {{p|Basculin}}.

===Evolution data===
Basculegion evolves from [[Basculin (Pokémon)#Form data|White-Striped]] {{p|Basculin}} when leveled up after losing at least 294 [[HP]] from [[Recoil|recoil damage]]. This can be spread across multiple battles and is not affected by the use of recovery items. [[Fainting]] will reset progress.

In {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, White-Striped Basculin does not need to level up after losing at least 294 HP from recoil damage in order to evolve.

{{main|Basculegion (TCG)}}

==Trivia==
* Basculegion is the only {{type|Ghost}} {{DL|List of Pokémon by shape|Pokémon with fins}}, and the only Ghost-type Pokémon in the {{egg3|Water 2}}.
* Basculegion:
** Is the only Pokémon with all five vowels in its English name.
** Is tied with {{p|Slither Wing}} and {{p|Poltchageist}} for the greatest number of unique characters in its English name, with 11 (including spaces).
** Has the longest English Pokémon name that is an {{wp|isogram}}.
* In {{g|Legends: Arceus}}'s internal data, Basculegion's primary Ability is {{a|Rattled}} instead of {{a|Swift Swim}}.
* In {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, White-Striped Basculin and Basculegion are not classified as [[regional form]]s for the purposes of {{pkmn|breeding}}, meaning that neither species would be required to hold an [[Everstone]] to produce White-Striped Basculin offspring.
** Furthermore, prior to the Version 2.0.1 update, Basculegion was unable to learn {{m|Endure}}, {{m|Swift}}, and {{m|Zen Headbutt}} via [[TM]], while its pre-Evolution could; however, this has since been fixed.

===Origin===
Basculegion may be based on {{wp|salmon}} and related species of the {{wp|Salmonidae}} family. Specifically, it may be based on the {{wp|Sakhalin taimen}} (nicknamed the "phantom fish" in Japan), a large, endangered species that lives in rivers in Hokkaidō. It also appears in {{wp|Ainu people|Ainu}} folklore as a giant, powerful creature that could devour deer or boars. Like its pre-Evolution, Basculegion also shares some similarities with the {{wp|largemouth bass}}, as well as other predatory fish such as the {{wp|snakehead}} and the {{wp|goliath tiger fish}}.

Basculegion's {{t|Ghost|Ghost|}} type and Pokédex entries may also be a reference to the rapid physical {{wp|Salmon_run#Deterioration|deterioration salmon suffer after spawning}}. While most salmon quickly die, some are able to remain alive for longer periods while their bodies rot away. When this happens, these salmon are colloquially referred to as "zombie salmon."

The male and female colorations of Basculegion may be inspired by the nuptial coloration of some salmon species, such as the {{wp|sockeye salmon|sockeye}} or the {{wp|coho salmon|coho}}, during mating season. While both male and female salmon change colors during this period, the males usually become redder and more vibrant, while the females are paler in comparison.

Basculegion's lower jaw and pectoral fins may also be inspired by an {{wp|Itaomacip}}, an enlarged boat with side plates built by the Ainu people for seafaring and trading purposes. In real life, the Ainu created an extensive maritime network surrounding the {{wp|Sea of Okhotsk}} with this vessel. This could also have inspired Basculegion's role as a {{hi|Ride Pokémon}} on water in Hisui.

The amount of recoil damage required for White-Striped Basculin to take to evolve into Basculegion, 294 {{stat|HP}}, could be {{wp|Japanese wordplay#Goroawase|goroawase}} for {{j|憎し}} ''nikushi'', archaic Japanese for hatred.

====Name origin====
Basculegion may be a combination of ''{{p|Basculin}}'' and ''legion'' (an army or a vast amount of people) or ''{{wp|Legion (demons)|Legion}}'' (a Biblical demon or group of demons).

Idaitou may be a combination of {{j|偉大}} ''idai'' (great), {{j|哀悼}} ''aitou'' (mourning), and {{j|イトウ}} ''itou'' (Sakhalin taimen).
