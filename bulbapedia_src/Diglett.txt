'''Diglett''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ディグダ''' ''Digda'') is a {{type|Ground}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s into {{p|Dugtrio}} starting at [[level]] 26.

In [[Alola]], Diglett has a dual-type {{2t|Ground|Steel}} [[regional form]]. It evolves into {{rf|Alolan}} Dugtrio starting at level 26.

It is [[Ecologically similar Pokémon|ecologically similar]] to {{p|Wiglett}}; however, the two are separate species.

==Biology==
Diglett is a tiny, brown {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that seems to be perpetually buried within the earth, leaving only its head visible. Its small stature makes it both the [[List of Pokémon by weight|lightest]] and [[List of Pokémon by height|shortest]] {{type|Ground}}. It has beady black eyes and a large, round, pink nose. A Diglett in [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team]] mentions that it has feet, though their size and appearance are unknown. It spends much of its time underground and has very thin skin. If Diglett is exposed to sunlight, its blood will heat up and cause it to grow weak.

Diglett lives in tunnels and {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Cave Pokémon|caves}} under the earth, where it feeds on tree roots and vegetables. It is known to live in burrows left behind by {{p|Onix}}. It also sometimes lives in burrows near forests and has even [[PK04|been shown]] to live inside of trees. Diglett digs regularly through the earth at a shallow depth, leaving perfectly tilled soil in its wake. Some farmers welcome Diglett because it tills their fields and its droppings enrich the soil, but others consider it a pest for eating their vegetables. As mentioned in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Diglett is known to sleep underground during the night. Seeing a Diglett asleep above ground is considered to be good luck.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref>

In [[Generation II]], Diglett and its evolved form, {{p|Dugtrio}}, were the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Fissure}}.

===Forms===
Diglett has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Alolan}} Diglett.

In [[Alola]], Diglett has developed three fine gold whiskers on its head from living in soil with high iron content and volcanic environment. These whiskers function as sensors and allow it to monitor its surroundings without coming above ground, though it will still occasionally poke its head out to see outside. The whiskers can also be used for communication, wobbling around to relay mood or emotion. They stand straight up for anger, swing around for happiness, and droop for sadness.<ref>[https://www.Pokémon-sunmoon.com/en-us/Pokémon/alolan-diglett/ Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Alolan Diglett]</ref> 

Needing to be able to dig through Alola's volcanic rock, Alolan Diglett is notably stronger than its non-Alolan counterparts. In Alola, their tunneling activity has resulted in creating cultivated soil. This cultivated soil is good enough for agriculture. The people in the Alola region are said to be very grateful for the actions of Alolan Diglett. However, they are still very small, tying with {{p|Klefki}} and {{p|Meltan}} as the shortest {{type|Steel}}. They can also be found in the [[Coastal Biome]] of [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]], where Alola's island life is simulated.

Alolan Diglett and its Evolution are the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Tangling Hair}} as an [[Ability]].

Despite Diglett having a strong resemblance to {{p|Wiglett}} from the [[Paldea]] region, the two Pokémon species are not biologically related, having entirely separate diets and habitats.<ref>[https://wpes.pokemon.co.jp/en/ World Pokémon Ecological Society]</ref> Their resemblance to each other is said to be a coincidental result of adaptations to their respective environments.<ref>[https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon/wiglett/ Pokémon Scarlet and Violet site | Wiglett]</ref>

===Evolution===
Diglett evolves into {{p|Dugtrio}}.

{{rf|Alolan}} Diglett evolves into Alolan Dugtrio.

===NPC appearances===
* {{g|Sword and Shield}} - [[The Isle of Armor]]: There is a side quest where the player is tasked with finding 150 Alolan Diglett scattered throughout the [[Isle of Armor]].
* {{g|Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl}}: Diglett and {{p|Dugtrio}} can be found roaming the halls of the [[Grand Underground]]. When 40 Diglett (or Dugtrio, which counts as 3) have been found, all players in the same Grand Underground session will receive a variety of bonuses for a period of 4 minutes. These include raising the odds of finding a [[Shiny Pokémon]] in a Pokémon Hideaway from 1/4096 to 1/2048, and forcing all Stone Boxes found when mining to become Pretty Stone Boxes.
* {{g|Pinball}}: Numerous Diglett appear in a bonus stage accessible from the Red Table, where the aim is to knock all the Diglett out. Once achieved a {{p|Dugtrio}} appears which must be knocked out. More Diglett appear on the Red Table itself and earn the player points upon being hit.
* [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team]]: The third story mission of the game is to rescue a Diglett from [[Mt. Steel]]. Afterwards, Diglett can be found near [[Pelipper Post Office]]. Diglett's hero is its father, {{p|Dugtrio}}, who it thinks can do anything.
* [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness]]: Diglett is one of the members of [[Wigglytuff's Guild|Wigglytuff Guild]]. His primary role is sentry duty, to examine visitors' footprints and say what Pokémon they are. Like in the first game, Diglett also has a father who it thinks can swim in the sea.
* [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX]]: A group of Diglett will accidentally burrow their way to the player's home from the Pelipper Post Office. As an apology, the player is given free access to use the tunnel to immediately go to the post office directly from their home.

{{main|Diglett (TCG)}}

==Trivia==
* Diglett and its evolved form share their {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Drilbur}}. They are all known as the Mole Pokémon.
* At the [[Heahea City]] Game Freak office in {{g|Sun and Moon}}, [[Shigeki Morimoto]] states that he made up Diglett when he was a little kid.
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Diglett was originally to use its Japanese name, "Digda", as its English name. This name was retained in the German localization of the games.
* Diglett and {{rf|Alolan}} Diglett have the lowest base {{stat|HP}} and {{stat|Defense}} stats of all {{type|Ground}} Pokémon.
** Alolan Diglett has the lowest base HP and Defense stats of all {{type|Steel}} Pokémon.
** Prior to [[Generation III]], Diglett had the lowest base HP stat of all Pokémon.
* In ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'', {{Gary}} claims Diglett is able to pull its head underground faster than the speed of light. In the English dub, this is changed to simply ''at'' the speed of light.
* Diglett is listed in [[Pokémon Stadium]] as having {{m|Acid}} as a valid move, despite not being able to learn the move.<ref>[https://tcrf.net/index.php?title=Pok%C3%A9mon_Stadium_(International)&oldid=337303#Unused_Event_Move Pokémon Stadium (International) - The Cutting Room Floor]</ref>
* Despite being the only species seen within the halls of the [[Grand Underground]] in [[Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl]], Diglett and Dugtrio cannot actually be caught or traditionally encountered in any of the Pokémon Hideaways.

===Design quirks===
[[File:Diglett feet reference PMD.png|frame|Diglett mentioning having feet in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon]]
* In [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team]] and their [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX|remake]], after the first [[Mt. Steel]] mission, Diglett mentions having feet. It is mentioned again as being one of the seven mysteries of Pokémon in a letter, alongside {{p|Arbok}}'s pattern changes and the inside of {{p|Forretress}}'s shell.
**Its ability to learn moves like {{m|Scratch}}, {{m|Hone Claws}} and {{m|Slash}} imply it has claws on its hands and feet. This also applies to its Alolan counterpart who can learn {{m|Metal Claw}}.
* Due to being embedded in the ground, Diglett and {{p|Dugtrio}} have special interactions with certain mechanics in the [[Pokémon games]].
** In {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}}, if Diglett is the {{player}}'s [[Walking Pokémon|partner Pokémon]], and the player goes to the [[Pokémon Center]], Diglett jumps to its [[Poké Ball]] to be healed.
** In the [[Pokéathlon]], Diglett and Dugtrio are unable to jump. In Hurdle Dash, they dig under hurdles instead of jumping them, in Lamp Jump they cannot move, and in Disc Catch they can only move but not jump to catch the discs.
** Since [[Generation V]], when Diglett and Dugtrio are sent out, they merely fade onto the screen instead of dropping down like all other Pokémon.<!--even those that fly or levitate go down-->
** In the [[Poké Transfer]], Diglett and Dugtrio run between bushes rather than jump.
** On the "Compare" screen of {{g|X and Y}}'s Pokédex, if the player taps the menu sprite of Diglett, Dugtrio, or {{me|Gengar}}, the Flying-type Pokémon will give up and disperse before even trying to lift it.
** Diglett, Dugtrio, {{p|Sandygast}}, {{p|Palossand}}, and {{me|Gengar}} are immune to {{m|Telekinesis}}. However, a Pokémon {{m|transform}}ed into one of these can be affected by Telekinesis.
** If a [[Z-Move]] animation, such as {{m|Supersonic Skystrike}}, results in showing Diglett or Dugtrio in the air, it is shown embedded in a floating chunk of ground.
** Hurricane will not lift Diglett or Dugtrio off the ground in the [[Generation VI]] animation like it does with other Pokémon.
** Since version 0.177.1 (Android)/1.143.1 (iOS) of {{g|GO}}, Diglett will not float in the air when it is evolved into Dugtrio, unlike other Pokémon.<ref>(June 17, 2020). "[https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/havuzx/now_diglett_evolves_respectfully_on_the_ground/ Now Diglett evolves respectfully on the ground!]" Reddit (r/TheSilphRoad).</ref>

===Origin===
Diglett appears to be based on an artificial {{wp|mole (animal)|mole}} used in the {{wp|Whac-A-Mole}} arcade games. This is referenced by its full health phrase in [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team]], "''Please don't whack me on the head!''".

Alolan Diglett's hair may be based on {{wp|Pele's hair}}, a thin {{wp|volcanic glass}} formed near {{wp|Hawaii}}an {{wp|volcano}}es. The darker soil surrounding its body may be a reference to {{wp|black sand}}, which is found on beaches near volcanoes. Its {{t|Steel}} type may be a reference to another kind of magnetic black sand found in {{wp|placer deposit}}s.

====Name origin====
Diglett may be a combination of ''dig'' and the suffix ''-let'' (indicating small size).

Digda may be derived from ''dig''.
