'''Meltan''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''メルタン''' ''Meltan'') is a {{type|Steel}} [[Mythical Pokémon]] introduced during [[Generation VII]]. It first appeared in {{g|GO}} and later made its [[core series]] debut in {{LGPE}}.

In Pokémon GO, it [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Melmetal}} by using 400 Meltan {{GO|Candy}}. It cannot evolve in the core series games.

Its appearance was first teased during the September Pokémon GO [[Community Day]] on September 22, 2018, and it was officially revealed on September 25, 2018.

==Biology==
Meltan is a small {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a silvery body of liquid metal. Its head is hard and resembles a golden {{wp|Nut (hardware)|hexagonal nut}}, with a small black sphere floating inside. This sphere serves as its eye. It has a red tail that resembles an electrical wire with two tiny protrusions at the end. According to official concept arts, Meltan's liquid body is made of {{wp|gallium}}, and it can cry gallium tears. Its arms can stretch to be longer or shorter.<ref name=Guide>''[[Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! & Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee!: Official Trainer's Guide & Pokédex]]'', p. 361</ref> Meltan is one of the smallest Pokémon, tying with {{rf|Alolan}} {{p|Diglett}} and {{p|Klefki}} as the [[List of Pokémon by height|shortest]] {{type|Steel}} Pokémon.

Meltan's body can corrode various metals, which it feeds on by absorbing them. The absorbed metals are circulated within Meltan's body to generate electricity, which it uses as an energy source. Meltan can also use this electricity to attack by firing it from its eye.<ref>[https://pokemonletsgo.pokemon.com/en-us/new-pokemon/ Pokémon Let's Go site | New Pokémon]</ref> According to [[Professor Willow]], Meltan has been described in ancient texts in the same place the [[Mystery Box]] was found. The Mystery Box was created by {{p|Melmetal}}'s followers to store away the Meltan created after its death, until one day, they could create a new Melmetal. At the end of a Melmetal's life span, it'll rust and fall apart, however its shards will eventually be reborn as Meltan. It is known to live in groups, until the day comes where one strong Meltan absorbs the rest of the group to evolve.

As seen in the {{aniseries|SM}} episode ''[[SM111|Show Me the Metal!]]'', the hexagonal nut on Meltan's body can be removed. It has also been seen working in packs. Meltan can spin its head, creating a sound that calls others of its kind. Its head-spinning can also be used as a sign of affection. In ''[[SM112|Got Meltan?]]'', it's revealed that it can be tamed if fed metal-like treats. In ''[[SM124|Living on the Cutting Edge!]]'', Meltan is shown multiplying in numbers overtime.

===Major appearances===
====[[Ash's Melmetal|Ash's Meltan]]====
{{Ash}} encountered a Meltan that arrived on [[Melemele Island]] with its fellow Meltan in ''[[SM111|Show Me the Metal!]]''. Ash eventually {{pkmn2|caught}} it in [[SM112|the next episode]] after it befriended {{AP|Rowlet}}, who helped it recover its hex nut head. It later evolved into Melmetal in ''[[SM138|Final Rivals!]]'' by combining with its fellow Meltan shortly before the [[Manalo Conference]] finals.

====Meltan (recurring)====
Multiple Meltan have made a number of appearances in {{aniseries|SM}}. For a time being, they lived in the [[Ultra Guardians]]' base in the [[Pokémon School]], where they assisted [[Lusamine's Clefable]] in exchange for food and continued to multiply. They eventually combined with Ash's Meltan to evolve into Melmetal in ''[[SM138|Final Rivals!]]''.

==Trivia==
* Meltan has several unique attributes:
** It is the only Pokémon capable of Evolution that cannot be evolved in the [[core series]] games. Because of this, it is not affected by [[Eviolite]].
** It is the only Pokémon with the [[Ability]] {{a|Magnet Pull}} that cannot also have {{a|Sturdy}}.
** It is the only [[Mythical Pokémon]] that is capable of [[Evolution]].
* Meltan and its evolved form share several unique attributes:
** They are the only Pokémon in {{LGPE}} to not be introduced in [[Generation I]].
** They are the only Pokémon in Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! whose [[List of Pokémon by Kanto Pokédex number|Kanto Pokédex number]] (152) is not the same as its [[List of Pokémon by National Pokédex number|National Pokédex number]] (808). While [[Kanto]] [[Pokédex]] numbers are normally used throughout the game, the [[stats judge|judge]] screen displays National Pokédex numbers, which is evident for Meltan and Melmetal.
** They are the only Pokémon officially introduced in [[Generation VII]] that are not in the [[Alola]] Pokédex.
** They are the only Pokémon in the National Pokédex of Pokémon GO and {{g|HOME}} ([[Nintendo Switch]] only) to not be listed in a region section. Instead, they are put into "Unidentified" and "Unknown Origins", respectively.
** They are the only Mythical Pokémon that can be [[trade]]d or placed in a {{GO|Gym}} as a defender in Pokémon GO.
* Meltan is the smallest Mythical Pokémon.
** It also has the lowest base stat total of all Mythical Pokémon.
* Meltan is the first Mythical Pokémon caught by a {{Ash|main character}} in the {{pkmn|animated series}}.
* In the animated series, {{an|Professor Oak}} is the person who gives Meltan its species name.
* According to [[Junichi Masuda]], Meltan and its Evolution were created for Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! out of a "desire to build a bridge between players of the core Pokémon series and players of Pokémon GO", to make both groups happy.<ref name=Guide />
* In a 2018 GameSpot interview, Junichi Masuda mentioned that Meltan was designed by a [[Game Freak]] staff member "who was also a fan of the original games and played them as a kid", with setting directions from Masuda. The finished designs and assets were then given to [[Niantic]] in order to plan and launch the debut event.<ref name="GameSpot LGPE">[https://web.archive.org/web/20181020175530/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-lets-go-pikachu-eevee-update-pokemon-yellow-fo/1100-6462538/ GameSpot: How Let's Go Pikachu / Eevee Update Pokemon Yellow For A New Generation]</ref>
** Two people were credited as "Pokémon Character Designers" in Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!: [[Misaki Hashimoto]] and [[Hironobu Yoshida]]. However, Yoshida has worked on the Pokémon games since {{game|Yellow}}, implying that it was Hashimoto that designed Meltan.

===Origin===
Meltan is based on a hexagonal {{wp|Nut (hardware)|nut}},<ref name="GameSpot LGPE"/> and its tail resembles an exposed wire. Its lower body is based on {{wp|gallium}},<ref name=Guide /> a metallic element with a relatively low melting point of about 86&nbsp;°F (30&nbsp;°C). Gallium is used to make {{wp|semiconductor}}s, and can easily "attack" other metals, such as {{wp|aluminium}} and {{wp|tin}}, to form {{wp|alloy}}s that are either very brittle or liquid at room temperature. These may be referenced with Meltan's liquid body, electric affinity, and ability to absorb metals.

Meltan may also be inspired by {{wp|Mercury (element)|mercury}}, a metallic element that is liquid at room temperature. Much like gallium, mercury can also conduct electricity, as well as react with many other metals to form alloys known as {{wp|Amalgam (chemistry)|amalgams}}.

====Name origin====
Meltan may be a combination of ''melt'', ''metal'', and たん ''-tan'' (diminutive Japanese suffix). It may also be derived from ''molten''.
