'''Walking Wake''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ウネルミナモ''' ''Uneruminamo'') is a dual-type {{2t|Water|Dragon}} [[Paradox Pokémon]] 
introduced during [[Generation IX]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

It is said to be either an ancient relative of {{p|Suicune}} or a counterpart of it from a parallel timeline.

It was revealed alongside {{p|Iron Leaves}} during the [[Pokémon Presents]] that aired on February 27, 2023, and debuted that same day in [[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet]]'s Version 1.2.0 update.

==Biology==
Walking Wake is a large, bipedal, theropod dinosaur {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with white, diamond-shaped markings. It has a long, white snout with one horn underneath the chin. The horizontal eyes are red, with yellow sclerae with red skin surrounding them. Its face and underside are also white as well. It has a thick, large purple mane covering its arms and back. The mane resembles the {{wp|aurora borealis}} with six tips of spiky hair being red and orange. It has two small light blue forelimbs, with three white-clawed digits each, and one diamond marking. Walking Wake has two powerful light blue hind legs with six feathers, and three white claws each. It has a large, hexagonal, cerulean blue crest on its forehead with two bent prongs on either side of the base. It has a blue horn between the snout and crest. It has two long, white tails with seven small spikes each. The tails also have eight blue spikes marking on the tops of two tails each.

Walking Wake is said to possess a ferocious temperament. It resembles a sketch made by a member of the Area Zero Expedition in the [[Scarlet Book]], and its name was derived from an aquatic monster described within the book. Walking Wake is able to walk on the surface of water and walks bipedally on its hind legs.<ref>[https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon/walking_wake/ Pokémon Scarlet and Violet official site]</ref> It possesses powerful control over water, and can generate {{m|Hydro Steam|superheated water to scorch its opponents}}. According to an illustration in Occulture, Walking Wake is believed to represent a super-ancient relative of {{p|Suicune}} from the past.

According to [[Professor Sada|AI Sada]], Walking Wake is an ancient Pokémon related to Suicune. However, according to a version of Professor Sada that appeared at the [[Crystal Pool]], Walking Wake is a counterpart of Suicune from another timeline. It is a highly mysterious species and its true origin is unknown. Walking Wake was brought to the depths of [[Area Zero]] by a [[time machine]] built by Professor Sada ten years ago. 200 years ago, [[Heath]] also encountered Walking Wake, as seen in the Scarlet Book, though it is unclear how it arrived there at the time.

Walking Wake is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Hydro Steam}}.

==Trivia==
[[File:Scarlet Book Legendary-Beast.png|200px|thumb|Sketch resembling Walking Wake in the Scarlet Book]]
* Before the official reveal of Walking Wake, a sketch of an imaginary Pokémon similar to it appeared in the [[Scarlet Book]] in {{g|Scarlet}} as an amalgam of the [[Legendary beasts]] ({{p|Raikou}}, {{p|Entei}}, and {{p|Suicune}}).
* Walking Wake and {{p|Iron Leaves}} can be considered counterparts of one another.
** They are both {{pkmn2|event}}-exclusive [[Paradox Pokémon]] with [[signature move]]s that can be caught only once per save file. 
** They are both based on a [[Legendary Pokémon]] that is a member of a [[Legendary trio]]. Despite being based on Legendary Pokémon, they are both not considered Legendary Pokémon themselves.
** They are the first Paradox Pokémon that can be encountered in a [[Tera Raid Battle]] and were both revealed and released simultaneously in the same [[Poké Portal News]] event and software update.
**They were both teased in the [[Scarlet Book]]{{sup/9|S}}/[[Violet Book]]{{sup/9|V}}, though neither of them appear in any editions of {{DL|Magazines in the Pokémon world|Occulture}} magazine.
** Prior to the release of [[The Indigo Disk]], their Pokédex entries in {{g|HOME}} were both only three words long and shared between Scarlet and Violet, but have been since replaced. Walking Wake's placeholder entry said "Ecology under research."
* Walking Wake, Iron Leaves, and {{p|Pecharunt}} are the only Pokémon that can be registered but are not required for the completion of the Blueberry Pokédex.

===Origin===
Walking Wake is based on {{p|Suicune}}. Its bipedal reptilian appearance is based on {{wp|theropod}} dinosaurs and possibly the {{wp|basilisk lizard}} — the latter also has the ability to run on water. It may also be based on the {{wp|Qilin}}, which appears to be one of Suicune's original inspirations.

Being more specific on Walking Wake's theropod features and Water typing, it could be based on a number of genera. It shares physical attributes with smaller theropods such as the ''{{wp|Coelophysis}}'' genus, also called to a lesser degree ''Rioarribasaurus'', from ''Río arriba'' (''upriver'' in Spanish), or the ''{{wp|Dilong}}'' genus, whose name translates to "emperor dragon". ''Coelophysis'' lived in the {{wp|Triassic}} period, characterized by a dry and hot climate, although with frequent flash floods in the areas with more rainfall, which may be referenced in its Water typing. As Walking Wake is much larger than the real-life ''Coelophysis'' and many other theropod dinosaur Pokémon, it may also be based on larger theropods such as ''{{wp|Giganotosaurus}}'', ''{{wp|Dryptosaurus}}'', or ''{{wp|Carcharodontosaurus}}'', which are commonly depicted with spines along its back similar to those seen on Walking Wake; the latter's name translates to "shark-toothed lizard", which corresponds to Walking Wake's Water/Dragon typing.

====Name origin====
Walking Wake is literally ''walking wake''. A {{wp|Wake (physics)|wake}} is a movement of water created by a moving object.

Uneruminamo can be taken literally as うねる水面 ''uneru minamo'' (undulating water's surface).
