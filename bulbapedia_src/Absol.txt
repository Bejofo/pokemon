'''Absol''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''アブソル''' ''Absol'') is a {{type|Dark}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation III]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Absol can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Absol''' using the [[Absolite]].

==Biology==
[[File:Astrid Absol Megahorn.png|left|200px|thumb|Absol expanding its horn]]
Absol is a quadrupedal, mammalian {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a primarily white feline-like body with some dark blue coloration. It has a ruff around its neck and chest and a tuft on the top of its head adorned with a single blue-black oval. Between the dark fur, the curvature of the white fur on its head, and the positioning of its horn, Absol's face vaguely resembles a wu wei symbol. It has a humanoid face with almond-shaped, red eyes, a scythe-like tail, and a scythe-shaped horn on the side of its head. Its broad feet are equipped with three claws each, and dewclaw-like spikes protrude from the heels of its hind legs and the elbows of its front legs. It walks with a pacing gait like that of a bear.

Absol lives in the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Mountain Pokémon|mountains}} far from civilization, and it rarely ventures down from its alpine home. Using its horn, Absol is able to sense even subtle changes in the sky and the land to predict when a disaster will occur and will try to warn people when one is approaching. In addition to its divination powers, Absol's horn can be {{m|Megahorn|extended and used in battle}}. Absol is also known to protect fields from natural disasters as well. This often has the unfortunate effect of Absol itself being blamed for the disaster, notably by the elderly. The hatred for Absol was started years ago by superstitions surrounding about it. Despite this, others are interested in its ability to predict disaster. Absol has been referred to as a ''bringer of doom''. Absol can move as swiftly as the wind. Absol is said to have a lifespan of up to 100 years. As mentioned in the [[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]], the powers of Absol's horn remains active even when it sleeps. Due to this, Absol can strongly detect danger even when not awake.

===Forms===
Absol can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Absol.

As Mega Absol, its fur is longer overall, and the increased energy coursing through its body makes the fur at the back of its mane stand on end so that it appears to have wings.<ref>http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/pokemon/mega_pokemon/</ref> The spikes on its heels and elbows grow larger, and the fur in these areas becomes longer as well. Its sickle-shaped horn widens, while an additional, smaller horn appears on the opposite side of its head. Its tail now has a more saw-like shape, and the oval marking on its forehead is now a rounded triangle.

Mega Absol emits a fearsome aura that has been known to kill fainthearted people from shock. It directs this aura at its opponents by beating its "wings", which are not capable of flight. However, Absol apparently detests assuming this form, as it normally dislikes fighting in the first place.

===Main series===
====Major appearances====
=====[[Goh's Absol]]=====
In ''[[JN064|Absol Absolved!]]'', [[Goh]] caught an Absol to save it from being hit by an eruption of boiling water on [[Mt. Chimney]]. It has since made further appearances in {{aniseries|JN}}.

=====Other=====
Absol debuted in ''[[M06|Jirachi: Wish Maker]]'', where it showed up to take {{OBP|Jirachi|M06}} back to [[Forina]]. However, Absol wasn't evil as {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} were initially led to believe, and it helped Jirachi once it returned to Forina.

Absol made its animated series debut in ''[[AG107|Absol-ute Disaster]]''. The people of a town were blaming Absol for all of the bad things that were happening to their town during the past month. Ash, his friends, and {{OBP|Nicky|AG107}} went out to verify the accusations. They found out that Absol was actually warning the town about a flood.

In ''[[AG167|What I Did for Love!]]'', {{OBP|Mollie|AG167}} used an Absol during the second round of the [[Gardenia Town]] [[Pokémon Contest]]. It battled [[Brock's Marshtomp]] and lost.

In ''[[AG180|May, We Harley Drew'd Ya!]]'', [[Drew]] revealed he {{pkmn2|caught}} and trained an Absol for the [[Kanto Grand Festival]]. It was first used in the [[Appeal|Appeals Round]]. In ''[[AG182|Thinning the Hoard!]]'' and ''[[AG182|Channeling the Battle Zone!]]'', it and {{p|Flygon}} were used during a [[Double Battle|two-on-two]] [[Contest Battle]] against {{an|May}}, who used {{TP|May|Combusken}} and {{TP|May|Squirtle}}. In the end, Drew lost too many points, resulting in May advancing to the next round.

In the original timeline of ''[[M12|Arceus and the Jewel of Life]]'', a {{m|Hypnosis|hypnotized}} [[Damos]] commanded four Absol to attack {{OBP|Arceus|M12}} with {{m|Shock Wave}}. When Ash and {{ashfr}} traveled to the past to prevent this, [[Marcus]], the one responsible for hypnotizing Damos, managed to use the Absol again to attack Arceus.

In ''[[XYS01|Mega Evolution Special I]]'', [[Astrid]] used an Absol that can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Absol against [[Alain]] and {{TP|Alain|Charizard}}, but it was defeated. In ''[[M17|Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction]]'', it was used in a battle against {{Ash}} and his {{AP|Hawlucha}}, which resulted in Absol winning. In ''[[XY126|Valuable Experience for All!]]'', it had a rematch with {{p|Hawlucha}} during the [[Lumiose Conference]], which resulted in a loss for Absol.

In ''[[XY028|The Bonds of Evolution!]]'', {{OBP|Magnus|XY028}} used an Absol to battle [[Diantha]] and her {{TP|Diantha|Gardevoir}}, but it was soon defeated by Gardevoir's {{m|Moonblast}}.

In ''[[SM053|Rescuing the Unwilling!]]'' and ''[[SM054|10,000,000 Reasons to Fight!]]'', a {{DL|Ultra Beasts (anime)|Nihilego}}-possessed {{an|Lusamine}} ordered her Absol to attack Ash and {{ashcl}}. {{an|Gladion}} stayed to battle Absol with his Pokémon before Nihilego was defeated.

====Minor appearances====
In ''[[DP020|Mutiny in the Bounty]]'', [[J]] and [[J's henchmen|her henchmen]] captured an Absol after [[Ash's Pikachu]], [[Melodi]]'s {{p|Gardevoir}}, and {{TRT}}'s {{MTR}} got stolen. Absol was eventually returned to its rightful owner after Ash, Team Rocket, and Melodi reunited with their Pokémon and some of J's minions were arrested.

An Absol appeared in ''[[M07|Destiny Deoxys]]''.

An Absol appeared in ''[[M11|Giratina and the Sky Warrior]]''.

In ''[[JN019|A Talent for Imitation!]]'', the [[Pokédex]] image of an Absol was displayed.

Three Absol appeared in a picture in ''[[JN064|Absol Absolved!]]''.

** In {{2v2|Black|White}}, Absol can be found at the [[Giant Chasm]], a place where disasters are said to befall Trainers, and {{rt|13|Unova}}, 13 being known as an unlucky number. {{game3|Black and White|Two years later|s 2}}, the Giant Chasm is where Team Plasma makes their stand.

===Origin===
{{Bulbanews|On the Origin of Species: Absol}}
Absol may be based on the {{wp|Bai Ze}} (白澤) of {{wp|Chinese mythology}}, whose name literally translates to "white marsh." It is generally described as a white beast, distinguished by having one or two horns on its head. Considered to be an intelligent beast, Bai Ze is gifted with the ability to understand human speech and the knowledge on the forms and habits of 11,520 types of supernatural creatures in the world. In legend, Bai Ze shared its knowledge to the Yellow Emperor, which was subsequently compiled in a book called ''Bai Ze Tu''. Few of its supposed fragments survive today. In Japan, it is known as the ''hakutaku'' (白沢) and is said to resemble a cat or lion. In a related legend, a similar creature known as the ''kutabe'' predicted that a plague would sweep through the {{wp|Toyama Prefecture}} of Japan. It is also sometimes said to have an extra eye on their head or back, which may be represented by the oval that appears on Absol's forehead.

Absol's head may be modeled after a ''{{wp|Taijitu}}'' symbol. Absol's humanized face and feline appearance may also be a homage to the {{wp|sphinx}}. Its ruff resembling long human hair and a male lion's mane and the white fur on the top of its head loosely resembling the headpiece of an Egyptian sphinx also suggests this. Its scythe-shaped tail and horn resemblance the Western personified depiction of {{wp|Death (personification)|Death}}, who is related to destiny and disaster. It may have also been inspired by the {{wp|black cat}} superstition. Its feline appearance and the fact that it is usually seen in mountains resemble the natural behavior of felines such as the {{wp|snow leopard}} and the {{wp|cougar}}.

Mega Absol's wings and elongated fur give it the appearance of an {{wp|angel}}, with its wings also being reminiscent of Greek portrayals of sphinxes and furthering the connection to sphinxes noted above. It also resembles a {{wp|lamassu}}, an Assyrian creature with a human's head, wings, and sometimes with the body of a lion. The lamassu was a protective spirit, much like how Absol attempts to warn people of danger.

====Name origin====
Absol may be derived from ''absolute'' or ''{{wp|absolution}}'' (setting free from guilt), as well as 危ない ''abunai'' (dangerous) and possibly 物騒 ''bussō'' (dangerous) or 恐る ''osoru'' (to fear). It may also be a combination of the Latin prefix ''ab-'' (away from) and ''sol'' (Latin for sun).
