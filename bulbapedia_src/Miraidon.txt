'''Miraidon''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ミライドン''' ''Miraidon'') is a dual-type {{2t|Electric|Dragon}} [[Legendary Pokémon|Legendary]] [[Paradox Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation IX]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

It is said to be either a future relative of {{p|Cyclizar}} or a counterpart of it from a parallel timeline. It also has an ancient variant, {{p|Koraidon}}.

Miraidon is the [[game mascot]] of {{pkmn|Scarlet and Violet|Pokémon Violet}}, appearing on the game's box art in its Ultimate Mode. In the [[Violet Book]], it is also known as the "'''Iron Serpent'''" (Japanese: '''テツノオロチ''' ''Tetsuno'orochi''). Along with {{p|Koraidon}}, it is considered part of the [[Paradox duo]] by fans.

==Biology==
[[File:Miraidon tongue Adventures.png|thumb|left|180px|Miraidon's robotic tongue]]
Miraidon is a large, robotic, {{wp|reptile|reptilian}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a primarily metallic, violet body. Its face, neck, abdomen, tail, and knee joints are silver, while its claws are white. A distinctive feature of Miraidon is the {{wp|gular skin|gular sac}} on its throat, which changes appearance across its various forms. Its head features a small, dark purple {{wp|Casque (anatomy)|casque}} reminiscent of a motorcycle windshield and circular, purple cheek markings. Miraidon's eyes resemble an {{wp|LED display}}, with black sclerae and pupils and pixelated irises that can change pattern to simulate blinking. Each eye is bordered by two connected silver plates that resemble eyelids, from which long blue and yellow plasma-like antennae extend, resembling eyebrows. Miraidon's shoulders are equipped with backward-curving, handlebar-like structures. A black, {{wp|Fender (vehicle)|fender}}-like structure is positioned on its lower back just above the base of its tail. Each of Miraidon's feet has three claws, with the central one marked by a vertical black line. Both its tail and gular sac have grooved surfaces, resembling {{wp|tire tread}}s. In the [[Pokémon Adventures]] manga, Miraidon is shown to possess a robotic tongue that visually resembles its gular sac.

Despite its mechanical appearance, Miraidon displays behavior that suggests an advanced level of intelligence and perceptiveness. It carefully evaluates a person's character using keen insight before deciding to accompany them. Miraidon's calm and enigmatic nature makes it difficult to discern its thoughts or emotions, with subtle hints only visible in its eyes. Miraidon also exhibits biological traits such as the ability to consume food, specifically [[Herba Mystica]] [[sandwich]]es, to regain strength and power, allowing it to access its transformations after being weakened. Due to the smell of Herba Mystica smell on them, Miraidon can track down [[Titan Pokémon]].

Miraidon can achieve high speeds and unleash powerful, electrically charged attacks, utilizing the {{a|Hadron Engine|advanced engine}} within its body to amplify its abilities, especially when surrounded by {{m|Electric Terrain}}. In battle, Miraidon can also {{m|Electro Drift|race at ultrafast speeds}} to pierce its targets with futuristic electricity. It shares similarities with {{p|Cyclizar}}, a contemporary Pokémon, though Miraidon is notably more powerful and aggressive.

The origins of Miraidon in the present day trace back to a [[time machine]] constructed by [[Professor Turo]], which brought two specimens to [[Area Zero]] a decade ago. These two individuals displayed contrasting temperaments: {{ga|Miraidon|one}} was friendly and curious, while the [[Area Zero#Area Zero Depths|other]] was aggressive and territorial. 200 years ago, [[Heath]] also encountered a Miraidon as seen in the [[Violet Book]], though it is unclear how it arrived in Area Zero at the time. According to [[AI Turo]], it is a futuristic relative of Cyclizar, though a version of Turo that appeared at the [[Crystal Pool]] suggests it may come from an alternate timeline. It was formerly referred to as the "Iron Serpent" in the Violet Book, with its current name, Miraidon, attributed to Professor Turo, potentially due to a {{wp|bootstrap paradox}}.
[[File:Miraidon attacks anime.png|thumb|250px|Ultimate Mode Miraidon shooting electricity from its hind legs, functioning as cannons]]
Miraidon has five different {{form|Form-like transformations|transformations}} it can change between as it traverses varying terrain and adapts to different situations. In "Ultimate Mode", Miraidon's body becomes charged with purplish-yellow energy. Its gular sac inflates and glows with a bluish-white light, while its antennae flare with electricity, taking on the appearance of lightning bolts. The middle and tip of its tail also emit this energy. Miraidon's back legs fold into its thighs, forming jet engine-like structures that enable it to hover and fly. Its legs also double as electrical cannons in this form. Its irises display a unique combination of light blue outer rings and yellow inner rings. Areas on its cheeks, arms, handlebars, and thighs are filled with light purple energy. When Miraidon enters sleep, it deactivates, causing its glowing features to turn silver. In battle, Miraidon floats to maintain a strategic position, applying pressure to grounded foes while predicting their movements and striking at their weak points. It uses electricity generated within its body to charge its claws, fangs, and tail, with one strike from its charged tail said to knock out even the most resilient opponents.<ref>[https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon/miraidon/ Miraidon — Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet | Official Website]</ref> Miraidon can unleash lightning from its mouth, neck, or hind legs, powerful enough to scorch the land. According to [[Arven]], this is considered Miraidon's true form. In "Low-Power Mode", Miraidon adopts a quadrupedal stance. It lacks the intense purplish-yellow energy seen in Ultimate Mode, resulting in a monochromatic silver appearance on its gular sac, antennae, and tail similar to when entering sleep in that transformation. Its irises remain light blue, and areas on its cheeks, antennae, handlebars, and thighs retain subtle light purple energy. Miraidon assumes this form when weakened or not engaged in battle. In all travel forms, Miraidon's tail stays tucked in, and its back legs remain folded, exposing its jet engines for propulsion. In "Drive Mode", energy is channeled to its tail and throat, creating wheel-like rings that enable high-speed movement and cliff climbing. In "Aquatic Mode", the rings expand to help Miraidon float and propel itself in water, using either the rotation of the rings or its jet engines. In "Glide Mode", its antennae extend to spread an energy membrane, allowing it to glide or fly through the air.<ref name=SVsite>[https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/news/legendary_pokemon/ Legendary Pokémon — Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet | Official Website]</ref><ref>[https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/news/flying/ Unlock the Power to Fly with Koraidon or Miraidon! - Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet | Official Website]</ref>

Miraidon is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Electro Drift}}. It is also the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Hadron Engine}} as an [[Ability]].

Miraidon debuted in ''[[PASV01|Speeding! Paldea's Prince of Speed!!]]'' as [[Violet Lang|Violet]]'s ride. In ''[[PASV02|Discover! The Quaking Earth Titan!!]]'', Violet revealed to [[Arven]] that he had encountered Miraidon as it crashed down on a beach near [[Cabo Poco]] and started following him after eating his [[sandwich]]. [[Professor Turo]] had then contacted him, informing him that Miraidon had previously been in his possession, and told Violet that its current depowered state could be remedied with the help of the [[Herba Mystica]], inspiring Violet to find them in order to unlock Miraidon's full potential. It debuted in its Drive Mode, with its other forms being unlocked and appearing later on.

==Trivia==
* Miraidon and {{p|Koraidon}} are the only [[Paradox Pokémon]]:
** Whose names follow regular Pokémon naming conventions.
*** To not have different names between languages.
** To each have their own unique Abilities.
* Miraidon is the tallest Paradox Pokémon in the Paldea Pokédex and the only known future Paradox Pokémon to be taller than both its {{p|Cyclizar|present-day}} and {{p|Koraidon|ancient}} relatives.
** It is also the only future Paradox Pokémon not to have the word "Iron" in its name. However, its previous name according to the Violet Book is "Iron Serpent".
** Miraidon is also the only {{type|Dragon}} Paradox Pokémon to be a Future Pokémon rather than an Ancient Pokémon.
* Miraidon has the highest base {{stat|Special Defense}} stat of all {{type|Electric}} Pokémon.
* Of all Pokémon, Miraidon and Koraidon have the highest number of forms that are obtainable in some capacity yet unusable in battle, as they each use three forms solely for travel and are obtained in their fourth 'low-power' forms, yet can only battle in their 'high-power' forms.
** Curiously, the forms are fully usable in battle when hacked into the game, albeit with various glitches and oddities.<ref>[https://tcrf.net/Pok%C3%A9mon_Scarlet_and_Violet#Dex_Entries Miraidon & Koraidon's Ride forms on The Cutting Room Floor]</ref>
*** In its unused Pokédex entry, the Ride forms of Miraidon are smaller than its Ultimate Mode, at 9'2" / 2.7m tall.
** {{p|Rotom}} has five forms that are unusable in battle ([[Rotom Pokédex|Pokédex]], [[Rotom Phone|Phone]], [[Rotom Bike|Bike]], [[Rotomi]], [[Drone Rotom|Drone]]), but Rotomi and Drone Rotom are completely unobtainable.
* The modes of Miraidon in Japanese and Korean use borrowed words from English, showing modernity, while the builds of {{p|Koraidon}} in the same languages use {{wp|Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese}} and {{wp|Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean}} words respectively, showing tradition and the past.
* In [[Generation IX]], prior to the Version 2.0.1 update of {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, Miraidon was able to learn {{m|Power Gem}} at level 49. After updating the game, it can only learn it via [[TM]].
* Despite being able to swim and fly with the player on its back, Miraidon cannot learn {{m|Surf}} or {{m|Fly}}. It shares this trait with its counterpart {{p|Koraidon}}.
* Miraidon is the subject of the [[Toyota Miraidon Project]], which sought to recreate the Pokémon as a mobile model.

===Origin===
Miraidon's appearance may be based on a robotic serpentine dragon and various lizards, such as the {{wp|anole}} or the genera ''{{wp|Sitana}}'' and ''{{wp|Sarada (lizard)|Sarada}}''—the latter two are collectively known as fan-throated lizards. Its  robotic look might also be a reference to how futuristic cultures are often depicted with the overuse of machines and robots, as opposed to Koraidon's traditional look. Some elements of its design may be based on parts of various {{wp|motor vehicle|motorized vehicle}}s (such as a {{wp|sport bike}} and other super bikes designed with maneuverability in mind for city streets and highways), with its {{wp|Casque (anatomy)|casque}} resembling a motorcycle windshield, its shoulders being similar to handlebars, its rear looking like the backrest of a vehicle seat, its throat and tail resembling wheels when active, and its legs resembling {{wp|jet engine|jet engines}} or {{wp|exhaust pipes}}. Miraidon's ability to rearrange itself when changing between forms may be inspired by {{wp|transforming robots}}. Miraidon's color scheme, along with the name of the game it debuts in, possibly stemmed from violet being on the opposite side of the visible spectrum of light from red (a prominent color associated with Pokémon Scarlet and Koraidon) as well as violet occasionally being associated with space (which is often considered the "final frontier", tying to Miraidon's hypothetical future motifs). Building on to this, it could be based on the concept of {{wp|Redshift#Blueshift|blueshifting}}, which is the phenomenon of things that move towards the observer (i.e things that are yet to come, in the future) appear blueish in color, which would make Miraidon a blueshifted version of the green Cyclizar.

Given its serpentine body and its {{t|Electric}} [[type]], it may take inspiration from {{wp|Sugaar}} in {{wp|Basque mythology}}. Originally venerated as the god of storms and thunder in pre-Christian Basque beliefs, Sugaar takes the form of a serpent and embodies lightning.

Additionally, due to its color scheme, its status as a [[Paradox Pokémon]], and it being the mascot of [[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet|Pokémon Violet]], it could be based on Ultraviolet, a color that exists beyond the human visible light spectrum. It can't be seen, but it's still there, much like the confusing and contradictory origins of the Paradox Pokémon.

====Name origin====
Miraidon may be a combination of 未来 ''mirai'' (future), ライド ''raido'' (ride), and ''dragon'', ''don'' (Spanish for lord), or ''-don'' (common suffix in dinosaur names derived from the Ancient Greek word for tooth).

Miraidon's name may have been intentionally designed to sound phonetically like ''me ride on'', referencing how the player rides around the Paldea region on it.

Its alternate name, Iron Serpent, is literally ''iron serpent''.

Tetsuno'orochi, its alternate name in Japanese, can be taken literally as 鉄の大蛇 ''tetsu no orochi'' (iron serpent).

In the [[Area Zero journals]], [[Professor Turo]] mentions having named Miraidon. Due to a {{wp|bootstrap paradox}} involving a version of Professor Turo [[time travel]]ing from the past, it is possible that the player in [[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet|Pokémon Violet]] may be responsible for indirectly coining Miraidon's name.
