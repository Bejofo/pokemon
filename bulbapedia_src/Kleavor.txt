'''Kleavor''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''バサギリ''' ''Basagiri'') is a dual-type {{2t|Bug|Rock}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced during [[Generation VIII]], in {{g|Legends: Arceus}}.

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Scyther}} when exposed to a [[Black Augurite]]. It is one of Scyther's final forms, the other being {{p|Scizor}}.

==Biology==
Kleavor is a {{wp|Mantis|mantis-like}} insect {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a craggy {{wp|exoskeleton}} featuring a rock-like composition. Its predominantly beige and white body is adorned with numerous black rocky protrusions, including a ring of angular rocks on each of its shoulders, a mask of rock lining its brows down to its jawline, two sharp toe claws on each foot, and a single black shard of rock atop the crown of its head. The large wings present on Scyther's back seem to have atrophied into {{wp|Vestigiality|vestigial features}} on Kleavor. Most notably, each of Kleavor's two spindly front limbs ends in large axe-like appendages made of heavy, {{a|Sharpness|extremely sharp}} black rock, capable of causing severe damage to even the hardiest of foes. Kleavor swings these appendages to carve and chop down trees, marking its territory.<ref name=LAsite>[https://legends.arceus.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon/kleavor/ Kleavor | Pokémon Legends: Arceus Official Website]</ref> It also uses these heavy stone axes to finish off prey.

Kleavor is an Evolution of {{p|Scyther}} caused by [[Black Augurite]]s, which are said to originate from volcanic regions in [[Hisui]] but are now extremely rare. The stones that adorn Kleavor's body often get chipped during fierce fights; larger chips are a sign that it is experienced in battle. Stone shards that fell off Kleavor during the battle were known to have been collected and used by the settlers of Hisui to craft tools.<ref name=LAsite/> Kleavor is known to be very hostile, and it is best avoided if ever encountered in the wild. Kleavor's nature is described as being rough, crude, and violent. 

Kleavor is implied to be at the brink of extinction in the present day, only known to be found in [[Blueberry Academy]], located somewhere in Unova's ocean, specifically in its [[Terarium]]'s [[Canyon Biome]].

A special Kleavor is worshiped by the Hisui people as he is descended from one of the ten ancient Pokémon blessed by {{p|Arceus}}. In particular, he is one of the [[Noble Pokémon]] who resides in [[Obsidian Fieldlands]] watched by the [[warden]] [[Lian]].

Kleavor is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Stone Axe}}.

===Evolution===
Kleavor evolves from Scyther in [[Hisui]]. It is one of Scyther's final forms, the other being {{p|Scizor}}. Kleavor only evolves from Scyther in the Hisui region.

===Main series===
[[File:Lucius Kleavor.png|thumb|250px|Kleavor in {{aniseries|HZ}}]]
====Major appearances====
=====[[Lucius's Kleavor]]=====
A Kleavor first appeared in a fantasy in ''[[HZ025|Rivals in the Dark of Night!]]'', where it's revealed that it was one of [[Lucius]]'s Pokémon and one of the [[Six Heroes]]. It physically debuted at the very end of ''[[HZ068|Into a New Sky! The Brave Olivine!]]'', albeit heavily shadowed, where it was spotted by [[Perrin]]. It properly appeared to Liko and her friends in ''[[HZ073|Kleavor the Solitary Warrior]]''.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Kleavor (TCG)}}
==Trivia==
* Despite having different base stats, Kleavor, {{p|Scizor}}, and {{p|Scyther}} all have a base stat total of 500. As such, Kleavor and Scizor are the only Pokémon to not have their base stat total change upon [[Evolution|evolving]].
* Kleavor, along with {{p|Wyrdeer}} and {{p|Ursaluna}}, are the first [[List of cross-generational evolutionary lines|cross-generational Evolutions]] that evolve from the original form rather than the regional form to be introduced since {{p|Sylveon}} in [[Generation VI]].
** Coincidentally, their pre-Evolutions cannot evolve into them outside of their [[Pokémon Legends: Arceus|debut game]]. In Kleavor's case, this is due to the absence of the [[Black Augurite]], though unlike the other two, Kleavor can be caught in the [[Canyon Biome]], while the other two require transferring their respective pre-Evolutions ({{p|Stantler}} and {{p|Ursaring}}) to the said game using [[Pokémon HOME]], evolving them there, and sending them back to be able to obtain them with the Scarlet and Violet origin mark.
* Kleavor is the only {{type|Rock}} {{DL|List of Pokémon by shape|Pokémon with two or more pairs of wings}}.
* Kleavor is the only Pokémon introduced in {{g|Legends: Arceus}} that can have the [[Galar]] [[origin mark|symbol]] or [[Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|Let's Go mark]], due to Scyther being able to have them.
* In the internal code of Legends: Arceus, Kleavor's Hidden Ability is {{a|Steadfast}} instead of {{a|Sharpness}}.
* Prior to Version 1.2.0 of {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, Kleavor's base Attack stat was decreased by 5 points to 130, and its Special Defense stat was increased by 5 to 75. This change was undone when Kleavor became available in those games. Similar occurences happened to Hisuian {{p|Zorua}} and Hisuian {{p|Zoroark}}.
** Prior to Version 2.0.1, Kleavor was unable to learn {{m|Rain Dance}} via [[TM]], while its pre-Evolution could.

===Origin===
Kleavor may be based on a {{wp|Mantis|praying mantis}}. Due to its coloration, it may be based on a {{wp|dead leaf mantis}} in particular. Its stones appear to be based on {{wp|obsidian}}, a volcanic glass with a deep black color that produces sharp edges when fractured. The shard on its head resembles a stylized {{wp|chonmage}}, a topknot hairstyle worn by samurai and sumo wrestlers, or a 髻 ''jì'', a Chinese topknot that was worn by men.

Kleavor's overall design, especially its stone axe forelegs, may be inspired by the idiom 蟷螂の斧 ''tōrō no ono'' (lit. mantis's axe), a figurative expression that connotes a courageous but doomed resistance. In Japanese, the alternate name for the mantis is 斧虫 ''onomushi'', literally meaning "axe bug".

====Name origin====
Kleavor seems to be a corruption of ''cleaver'', or a combination of ''cleaver'' and ''razor''. It may also involve ''{{wp|ore}}'' (a natural and valuable rock).

Basagiri may be a combination of バッサリ ''bassari'' (with a single stroke), ばさら ''basara'' (acting without restraint; a term used during medieval Japan describing the disregard for the higher ranks), a corruption of ''berserker'', 鉞 ''masakari'' ({{wp|broadaxe}}), and カマキリ ''kamakiri'' (mantis).
