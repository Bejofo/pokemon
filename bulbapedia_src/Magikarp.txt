'''Magikarp''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''コイキング''' ''Koiking'') is a {{type|Water}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s into {{p|Gyarados}} starting at [[level]] 20.

==Biology==
[[File:Magikarp Jump Pattern 30.png|thumb|left|200px|The "Blue Raindrops" variety of Magikarp]]
Magikarp is a {{wp|fish|piscine}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with large, heavy reddish-orange scales. It has large, vacant eyes and pink lips. Its {{wp|fish fin|pectoral}} and tail fins are white. On its back is a stiff, three-peaked yellow fin, resembling a crown; there is an identical fin on its underside. It also has long {{wp|barbel (anatomy)|barbels}}. The barbels are white on a female and pale-yellow on a male. A long-lived Magikarp is able to utilize its immense splashing power to leap high enough to scale mountains. It also has a strong enough immune system to survive in the most polluted of waters. However, it is usually overlooked by Trainers because of its perceived weakness: even in the heat of battle, it will do nothing but flop around. It is believed that the ancestors of Magikarp were actually much stronger than modern Magikarp, and this led scientists to research this species.

Magikarp is found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Water's-edge Pokémon|many bodies of water}}, such as lakes, rivers, and ponds. However, due to its weak swimming ability, it usually lives downstream of the water's flow. In [[Generation I]], {{m|Splash}} was its [[signature move]]. It is often seen using Splash to leap out of the water, which makes it an easy target for predators such as {{p|Pidgeotto}} and {{p|Pidgeot}}. {{p|Frillish}} is also known to prey on Magikarp.

In [[Hoppy Town]], there are at least [[Variant Pokémon#Magikarp|31 unique pattern varieties]] of Magikarp, with their scales coming in colors such as gray, black, white, purple, pink, violet, apricot, and brown. These patterns can be classified by groups, depending on how the Magikarp looks while it is still small; a specific pattern arises when it becomes bigger. Which patterns can be caught depend on the type of Old Rod; the better the rod, the more groups of patterns can be fished. The people in Hoppy Town train their Magikarp to jump the highest in order to compete in a series of [[League]]s to win prizes.

===Evolution===
Magikarp evolves into {{p|Gyarados}}.

==Trivia==
[[File:Magikarp Red Battle Chess.png|thumb|Magikarp in Pokémon Battle Chess]]
* In the [[Generation I]] games, Magikarp, {{p|Slowpoke}}, and {{p|Rhyhorn}} are the only Pokémon to have their [[List of Pokémon icons in Generations I and II|icon]] changed upon [[Evolution]].
* Magikarp and {{p|Gyarados}} are the only {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that can be obtained without a [[trade]], [[transfer]], or {{pkmn2|event}} in every [[core series]] game.
* Magikarp, Gyarados, and {{p|Regigigas}} are the three Pokémon that can be encountered in the {{pkmn2|wild}} at the lowest and highest levels. In {{game|Platinum}}, Magikarp can be found at levels ranging from level 1 to 100 in the [[Resort Area]], and in {{B2W2}}, it can be found at the same levels in the [[Nature Preserve]]; both require a [[Super Rod]].
** Furthermore, Magikarp can be encountered at level 100 in the rightmost lake of [[Fellhorn Gorge]] in [[Kitakami]].
* Magikarp and its evolved form require the fewest [[Egg cycle]]s to hatch, with five.
** Magikarp and its evolved form are also the only Pokémon with a [[List of Pokémon by breeding attributes|unique base Egg cycle]].
* Magikarp was the first Pokémon featured in [[Professor Oak's Pokémon Lecture]] in [[EP061]].
* Magikarp and its evolved form's [[Egg Group]] combination ({{egg|Water 2}} and {{egg|Dragon}}) is unique.
* Magikarp is one of fourteen Pokémon that one could collect [[foreign Pokédex entries]] for in {{game|Diamond and Pearl|s}}.
* Magikarp shares several notable similarities to {{p|Feebas}}:
** Its level-up moves are exactly the same as those of Feebas.
*** However, Feebas can learn multiple moves from [[TM]]s and [[HM]]s, hatch from an Egg with [[Egg Move]]s, and learn new moves via Move Tutors, making it slightly more useful in battle.
** Magikarp shares its {{pkmn|category}} name with Feebas. They are both known as the Fish Pokémon.
** Magikarp and Feebas have almost identical stats. However, Magikarp has a higher {{stat|Special Attack}} and {{stat|Defense}}, while Feebas has a higher {{stat|Attack}} and {{stat|Special Defense}}. Both Attack and Defense stats for Magikarp and Feebas are reversed.
** They share the largest base stat total increase of all Pokémon when they evolve: 340 (from 200 to 540).
** They both change appearances drastically after Evolution, evolving into serpentine, dragon-like Pokémon.
* Magikarp has the lowest base {{stat|Attack}} stat of all {{type|Water}} Pokémon.
** Magikarp is also tied with {{p|Caterpie}}, {{p|Weedle}}, {{p|Igglybuff}}, {{p|Carvanha}}, {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Attack Forme}} {{p|Deoxys}}, and {{p|Stonjourner}} for having the lowest base {{stat|Special Defense}} stat of all Pokémon.
* Magikarp is the only Pokémon which can be found in every [[Pokémon Snap]] course except [[Rainbow Cloud]], which features only {{p|Mew}}.
* Together with {{p|Pichu}}, {{p|Rattata}}, {{p|Ninjask}}, {{p|Goldeen}}, and {{p|Seedot}}, Magikarp is the easiest Pokémon to catch in {{vg|Pokémon Ranger}}, with only one loop necessary.
* Magikarp is the only Pokémon in [[Pokémon Conquest]] that uses a move that it does not share a type with, as it uses {{m|Splash}}.
* On July 28, 2016, and May 12, 2017, [[The Pokémon Company]] and [[The Pokémon Company International]] respectively posted a Magikarp-themed music video onto their YouTube channels, titled [[the Magikarp Song]].
* Magikarp appears in {{DL|Pokémon Battle Chess|Pokémon Battle Chess}}. It doesn't behave like any traditional piece in chess. When damaged, it reveals Gyarados.
* Although Magikarp is stated by multiple Pokédex entries to be "the weakest Pokémon", there are several Pokémon with lower [[base stats|base stat totals]], such as {{p|Sunkern}}, or with access to fewer viable moves, such as {{p|Unown}} only being able to learn {{m|Hidden Power}}, and {{p|Cosmog}} and {{p|Cosmoem}} being unable to learn any damaging moves at all.

===Origin===
{{Bulbanews|On the Origin of Species: Magikarp}}
Magikarp appears to be based on the {{wp|Asian carp}}, which are easily frightened by disturbances in water and can jump 8–10 feet (2.5–3 m.) in the air. Its Shiny coloration may be a visual pun on a {{wp|goldfish}}. The golden dorsal fin of Magikarp may be based on a crown which likely originate from the pun on the Japanese word for goldfish 金魚 ''Kingyo''. Magikarp's permanently open mouth may be a reference to ''{{wp|koinobori}}'', a carp-shaped {{wp|windsock}} traditionally flown to celebrate {{wp|Children's Day (Japan)|Children's Day}} in Japan.

Magikarp's Evolution into Gyarados may be based on a legend about how carp that leaped over the {{wp|Longmen (mythology)|Dragon Gate}} would become dragons. Several waterfalls and cataracts in China are believed to be the location of the Dragon Gate. This legend is an allegory of the drive and efforts needed to overcome obstacles. This may have inspired an element in {{g|Snap}} where, after certain steps are taken, a Magikarp can splash its way into a waterfall where it evolves, as well as in {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, as there is a waterfall in the Fabled Springs area of the [[Coronet Highlands]] where a school of Magikarp can be found at the plunge pool of the waterfall, while a small population of Gyarados can be found at the edge of the waterfall.

====Name origin====
Magikarp may be a combination of ''magic'' (referring to its drastic power increase upon evolving into Gyarados or to magical goldfishes) and ''{{wp|carp}}''.

Koiking may be a combination of 鯉 ''{{wp|koi}}'' (carp) and ''king'', which may come from 金魚 ''Kingyo'' (goldfish).
