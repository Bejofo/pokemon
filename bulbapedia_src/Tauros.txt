'''Tauros''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ケンタロス''' ''Kentauros'') is a {{type|Normal}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, but it is considered to be a counterpart of {{p|Miltank}}.

In [[Paldea]], Tauros has [[#Form data|three]] different [[regional form]]s: '''Combat Breed''', which is pure {{type|Fighting}}, '''Blaze Breed''', which is dual-type {{2t|Fighting|Fire}}, and '''Aqua Breed''', which is dual-type {{2t|Fighting|Water}}.

==Biology==
[[File:Tauros Charge VII OD.png|200px|thumb|left|Poké Ride Tauros]]
Tauros is a quadrupedal, {{wp|bovine}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. It is covered in light brown fur with a thick, darker brown mane around the neck. It has a hump on its shoulders, a rounded muzzle with a dark brown nose, small, triangular eyes, three gray bumps running vertically down its forehead, and a pair of curved, gray horns growing from atop its head. Each of its three black tails has a tuft of fur on the end, and there is a single gray hoof on each foot. Tauros is a male-only species.

Tauros is a violent, rowdy Pokémon that whips itself into a frenzy using its three tails. It serves as a warning to others that Tauros is about to charge with astonishing speed. Once it starts charging, it is unable to stop or change course until it hits something. Tauros are capable of smashing through large boulders when charging. It lives and travels in herds on {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|plains and grasslands}}. It will lock horns with others of its kind, and the herd's protector takes pride in its battle-scarred horns.

While still ferocious, Tauros are calmer in [[Alola]] than elsewhere, likely due to the region's climate. It is believed that the practice of using Tauros as [[Poké Ride|Ride Pokémon]], which is done to this day, originated in Alola. In contrast, Tauros in [[Galar]] are more volatile and don't like to be ridden.

Tauros is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Raging Bull}}.

===Forms===
In [[Paldea]], Tauros has three separate [[regional form]]s: Combat Breed, Blaze Breed, and Aqua Breed.

All three forms of Paldean Tauros are covered in dark gray fur, and have a thick black mane, gray horns, black hooves, and dark gray tails with black tips. Each form also has three gray bumps running vertically on its forehead, increasing in size from top to bottom. The physical differences between the three forms are visible on the shapes of their horns, manes, and tails. The three forms of Paldean Tauros are known as "The Wild Bulls of Paldea".

;Combat Breed
The Combat Breed of Paldean Tauros has short, rounded, almost straight horns, and its mane and tails are shaped similarly to Kantonian Tauros. Combat Breed Paldean Tauros is known for its thick, powerful muscles and aggressive nature. Thanks to its muscular body, it is skilled at close-quarters combat, able to use its horns to strike at an opponent's weak spots.

;Blaze Breed
The Blaze Breed of Paldean Tauros has sharp horns, pointing forward and bent at right angles. Its mane is spiky with streaks of red, and its tails are intertwined. Blaze Breed Paldean Tauros earns its name from the hot air it breathes from its nostrils. When channeling its fire energy, the bumps and horns on Blaze Breed Paldean Tauros's head will glow red. The horns can reach a temperature of over 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit (1,000 degrees Celsius), causing anyone gored by them to suffer both wounds and burns.

;Aqua Breed
The Aqua Breed of Paldean Tauros has horns that usually point upward but can rotate backward — each horn has two round, bulbous forms and a hole on its tip. Its mane flows downward and is shaped like a beard, with five teardrop-shaped blue accents on it. Its tails are usually straight, but can bend to form a propeller shape, which aids it in swimming. Aqua Breed Paldean Tauros is recognized for its high body fat, which allows it to float easily in the water. It swims by unleashing high-pressure jets of water from its horns, as well as using its tails to propel itself. It can use the same water jets to pierce right through any enemy it hits. The bumps and horns on Aqua Breed Paldean Tauros's head will glow light blue when it attacks.

===Form data===
{{rf|Paldean}} Tauros has three non-interchangeable forms: Combat Breed, Blaze Breed, and Aqua Breed. Visually, each breed has different horns, manes, and tails. The breeds have different [[type]]s, with Combat Breed being {{type|Fighting}}, Blaze Breed being dual-type {{2t|Fighting|Fire}}, and Aqua Breed being dual-type {{2t|Fighting|Water}}. They also learn different [[move]]s, and the type of Tauros's [[signature move]] {{m|Raging Bull}} changes based on the user's form, being Fighting-type for Combat Breed, Fire-type for Blaze Breed, and Water-type for Aqua Breed.

In {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, the Blaze Breed is found exclusively in Pokémon Scarlet, while the Aqua Breed is found exclusively in Pokémon Violet. The Combat Breed is the most common of the three and is found in both versions. Regular Tauros bred in Paldea without an Everstone will always produce Combat Breed Paldean Tauros.

In ''[[PS016|Tauros the Tyrant]]'', a Tauros, apparently captured in the {{safari|Kanto}}, was used as a mount by members of [[Team Rocket]]. By whipping his tails, he was able to control the Pokémon of the other {{tc|Team Rocket Grunt}}s, a method that {{adv|Green}} easily exploited by pushing it off a cliff and having [[Ditty]] mimic its appearance. He was later used in ''[[PS129|Great Girafarig]]'' to chase after Suicune, only to be defeated after Eusine's {{p|Jumpluff}} had {{m|Leech Seed}}ed him.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Tauros (TCG)}}

==In the TFG==
One Tauros figure has been released.

* {{TFG|Next Quest}}: {{TFG ID|Next Quest|Tauros|36}}

==Trivia==
* In the original {{g|Red and Green}}, the Pokédex entry mistakenly states Tauros has 2 tails; this was corrected to 3 in FireRed. 
* Tauros can be seen as a counterpart to {{p|Miltank}}. Both are bovine-like Pokémon with the same base stat total. While Tauros is a male-only species, Miltank is a female-only species.
** Despite not being associated with a certain group, both Tauros and Miltank are listed on the same [[Pokédex]] page in [[Pokémon Sun and Moon]]. The same trait is true with {{p|Oranguru}} and {{p|Passimian}}.
* According to {{g|Sun and Moon}}, Tauros was designed by [[Shigeki Morimoto]].
** Additionally, in Pokémon Sun and Moon, if the {{player}} brings a Tauros with a Game Boy [[origin mark]] to [[Game Freak]] Morimoto at [[Heahea City]], he will remark on how Tauros used to be one of the most powerful Pokémon in the [[Generation I]] [[core series]] {{pkmn|games}}, in part because it could learn {{m|Blizzard}}.
** All three forms of Paldean Tauros were designed by [[James Turner]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/JamesTurner_42/status/1639923490957545472 Tweet by James Turner (@JamesTurner_42).] Posted on March 26, 2023.</ref>
* Tauros is the only Pokémon to have more than one [[regional form]] within the same region; in the [[Paldea]] region, it has three different regional forms.
* Tauros forms a notable bug in [[Pokémon Play It!]], a game largely based on the Trading Card Game. Once the "Tauros" card appears, either in the player's own deck or that of the digital opponent, the game will shut down or freeze the player's computer.
* In {{game|Crystal}}, a [[List of glitches in Generation II#Heavy Ball junk data glitch|bug]] causes the capture formula for the [[Heavy Ball]] to incorrectly retrieve this Pokémon's weight, giving it a +40 catch rate modifier. This also affects {{p|Kadabra}} and {{p|Sunflora}}.
* Blaze Breed {{rf|Paldean}} Tauros is the only dual-type {{t|Fighting}}/{{t|Fire}} Pokémon to not be an evolutionary relative of a [[first partner Pokémon]].
** Blaze Breed Tauros is the only dual-type Fighting/Fire Pokémon to have Fighting as its primary type instead of its secondary type.
* There is an entry for Kantonian Tauros in the [[List of Pokémon by Paldea Pokédex number|Paldean Pokédex]], even though it was not available in {{g|Scarlet and Violet}} unless transferred from {{g|HOME}}. The same entry was later made available through the [[List of Pokémon by Blueberry Pokédex number|Blueberry Pokédex]].
** The entry for Kantonian Tauros in Violet was edited slightly as of version 1.3.0. The original text is as follows: "They fight each other by locking horns. The herd's protector takes pride in its battle-scarred horns." It is identical to Kantonian Tauros's Pokédex entries in {{game|Gold}}, {{pkmn|Stadium 2}}, and {{game|HeartGold}}.

===Origin===
Tauros appears to be based on a {{wp|Cattle|bull}} or a {{wp|bison}} and may also be based on the constellation {{wp|Taurus (constellation)|Taurus}}. Its tails may be based on a {{wp|whip}}, more specifically the {{wp|cat o' nine tails}}.

Paldean Tauros's appearance, typing, and the fact that it is found in a region inspired by {{wp|Spain}} easily suggest inspiration from the {{wp|Spanish fighting bull}}. The black color could also be inspired by the {{wp|Osborne bull}}, which has become a cultural emblem of Spain. The two variations of Paldean Tauros being Fire and Water types specifically could be a reference to two of the most famous bullfighting practices in Spain: the {{wp|Toro embolado}}, mainly from the {{wp|Valencian Community}}, where the bull horns are set on fire; and the {{wp|es:Bous a la Mar|Bous a la Mar}}, from the Valencian region of {{wp|Dénia}}, where the bulls run down the Marqués de Campo street and end up swimming in the {{wp|Mediterranean Sea}}. The Aqua Breed form may also be loosely based on a {{wp|water buffalo}}, and the form of its tails could take inspiration from ship {{wp|propeller}}s or {{wp|water wheel}}s; as well as the {{wp|triskelion}}, a popular motif used by ancient European cultures, especially the {{wp|Celts}}.

====Name origin====
Tauros may be derived from its Japanese name, Kentauros. It may also be derived from ταῦρος ''tauros'' (Greek for bull).

Kentauros may be derived from Κένταυρος ''Kéntauros'' (Greek for {{wp|centaur}}).
