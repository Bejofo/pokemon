'''Sableye''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ヤミラミ''' ''Yamirami'') is a dual-type {{2t|Dark|Ghost}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation III]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Sableye can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Sableye''' using the [[Sablenite]].

==Biology==
[[File:SableyeAlolanMoonlight31.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Sableye feeding on gems]]
Sableye is a bipedal humanoid {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a dark purple body, armed with sharp teeth and claws, which it uses to dig through soil. It has pale blue, gemstone-like eyes, which allow it to see in low light and sparkle in the dark. It also has a red gemstone on its chest, and its back has a blue and green gemstone as well as another red one. These gem-like eyes and adornments on its body are caused by its diet, which consists of rocks and raw gemstones. Because of this, each individual Sableye can create an infinite number of patterns on its body.

It also targets {{p|Carbink}} as prey, though they are usually taken by {{p|Gabite}} before Sableye can reach them. It is feared by people since it is said to steal a person's soul if they look into its eyes. It is nocturnal and is rarely seen. Sableye makes its habitat in the darkness of {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Cave Pokémon|caves}}. It uses its claws to dig for gems to eat and for combat. As mentioned in the [[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]], Sableye is known to occasionally sleep while holding its gemstones.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex entry]]: "Sableye feeds on gemstone crystals. You sometimes see it sleeping while fondly clutching the gemstones it has gathered. Perhaps it's dreaming of eating them until its belly is stuffed."</ref> It is believed that Sableye dreams of eating gemstones until it feels satisfied. In the {{aniseries|HZ}} episode [[HZ092]], Sableye was shown targeting the [[Legendary Pokémon]] {{p|Terapagos}} as prey.

Sableye is the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Stall}} as an [[Ability]].

===Forms===
Sableye can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Sableye. 

As Mega Sableye, being bathed in Mega Evolution energy causes the red jewel on its chest to rip out of Sableye's skin and significantly increase in size; the detached jewel leaves a small hole in Mega Sableye's chest. Its ears elongate, and it gains a spike on the top of its head. Its teeth turn from white to yellow, and its eyes also change from pale blue to crimson red, with diagonal slits at their inner edges. Its back gains more gems: a second green one, a second red one, and two small yellow gems. 

The enlarged jewel is said to boast such incredible hardness that no attack can even leave a scratch on it. During battle, Mega Sableye shelters itself behind the jewel, from where it can take advantage of any openings its target leaves exposed.<ref name= "Mega">http://www.pokemonrubysapphire.com/en-us/pokemon/new-mega-evolutions/mega-sableye</ref> However, being forced to support its massive jewel leaves Sableye unable to turn quickly, making it vulnerable from behind. As seen in the {{pkmn|animated series}}, the giant jewel wears off and shrinks as it blocks attacks. Once the jewel is reduced to a very small size, Sableye will eat it before reverting back from its Mega-Evolved state in the process.

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
{{spoilers}}
* [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness]]: Six Sableye acted as assistants to {{mdc|Dusknoir|2}} and had a number of appearances over the course of the game. After the player defeats Dusknoir and the Sableye in the [[Hidden Land]], the Sableye all flee.
* [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky]]: Six Sableye perform the same role as above, and in addition appear in Special Episode 5, which contains the events happening after Grovyle returns to the future with Dusknoir, and play a role in the episode's plot.
* {{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}}: One of Dusknoir's Sableye appears as a recruitable Pokémon but will only post the connection request after Dusknoir is recruited. Sableye's request also leads to Spiritomb's recruitment.

==Trivia==
* Sableye seems to be the counterpart of {{p|Mawile}}. Both of them are [[version-exclusive Pokémon]] to {{2v2|Ruby|Sapphire}}, {{2v2|HeartGold|SoulSilver}}, {{pkmn|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, {{pkmn|Sword and Shield}}, and {{2v2|Brilliant Diamond|Shining Pearl}}, found in the same locations in each paired version. Both also have [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolved]] forms and the same [[base stats|base stat totals]], as well as [[HP]] and {{stat|Speed}}.
* Sableye shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Murkrow}}. They are both known as the Darkness Pokémon.
* Mega Sableye has the lowest base Speed stat of all {{type|Dark}} Pokémon.
* Mega Sableye is the [[List of Pokémon by height|smallest]] Mega Evolution at 1'08" (0.5 m), the same height as its normal form.
* Prior to the introduction of the {{t|Fairy}} type in [[Generation VI]], Sableye (along with {{p|Spiritomb}}) had no weaknesses under normal conditions.

===Origin===
Sableye may be based on the {{wp|Kelly–Hopkinsville encounter|Hopkinsville Goblin}}, a creature from an alleged Kentucky alien encounter described as having shining eyes, small legs, clawed arms and swaying hips (a movement that Sableye imitates in the 3D Pokémon games). The Hopkinsville aliens are most famous in Japan, where they have appeared in several media.

The [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire Versions|ruby, sapphire]] and [[Pokémon Emerald Version|emerald]] on Sableye's body may be a reference to the games it debuted in.

====Name origin====
Sableye may be a combination of ''sable'' (either referring to {{wp|Sable (heraldry)|the heraldic color}} or {{wp|Sable|the animal}} it is named after) and ''{{wp|eye}}''. It may also be a play on ''able-eyed''.

Yamirami may be a combination of 闇 ''yami'' (darkness) and 恨み ''urami'' (grudge, malice) or 睨み ''nirami'' (glare).
