'''Arceus''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''アルセウス''' ''Arceus'') is a {{type|Normal}} [[Mythical Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation IV]].

Arceus is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon. Its [[signature Ability]], {{a|Multitype}}, allows it to [[Type change|change its type]] and [[#Form data|form]] when holding a [[Plate]] or a [[type]]-specific [[Z-Crystal]], while its [[signature move]], {{m|Judgment}}, is a powerful attack that changes its type to match the Plate or Z-Crystal Arceus is holding.

Like {{p|Darkrai}} and {{p|Shaymin}} before it, Arceus was not officially acknowledged by Nintendo until February 14, 2009, the year of its [[M12|debut movie]]. It was later officially revealed to international audiences on August 3, 2009. Arceus plays a central role in ''{{g|Legends: Arceus}}'', serving as the game's titular character and a key figure in its storyline.

Arceus created the [[Pokémon of myth]] and the entire [[Pokémon universe]]. Known as the '''Original One''' (Japanese: '''そのもの''' ''Sono mono'', "the very being"), Arceus was worshiped in ancient times by the people of [[Hisui]] under the name '''Almighty Sinnoh''' (Japanese: '''シンオウ{{Ruby|様|さま}}''' ''Sinn'ō-sama'').

==Biology==
[[File:LA Arceus Realm.png|thumb|250px|left|The unnamed form Arceus takes in [[Dimension#Arceus's realm|its realm]]]]
In its {{type|Normal}} form, Arceus is a white, equine {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with an androgynous appearance. It resembles a {{wp|qilin}} or {{wp|centaur}} with a gray, vertically striated underside. The striated pattern also appears on the underside of its mane, tail, and face. Its four pointed feet are tipped with gold hooves. Its long mane juts away from its head, and its face is gray, with green eyes, red pupils, and a green circular pattern below its eyes. Arceus also has a streak of gold coloration on its head, which points upward. Its neck is fairly long, with two pairs of extrusions to the sides, and a flap-like feature on the neck's underside that is colored white like much of the body. Arceus also has a golden cross-like wheel attached to its body by its round abdomen. The wheel also has four green jewels attached to it. The pattern of striated gray of Arceus's underbelly continues past its waist. Its limbs have gray undersides and extrusions at the tops of the legs. Arceus's tail is similar to its mane in terms of shape and coloration. Despite its quadruped appearance, Arceus is capable of flight.

According to legend, it shaped the [[Pokémon universe]] using its 1,000 arms. Arceus has been referred to as the "Original One" in myths and legends and is generally considered one of the strongest Pokémon. Arceus is believed to be the creator of the [[Sinnoh]] and [[Ransei]] [[region]]s, the [[Pokémon world]], and possibly, even the entire [[Pokémon universe]]. It also created {{pkmn|egg}}s which the [[Pokémon of myth]], {{p|Dialga}}, {{p|Palkia}}, and {{p|Giratina}}, hatched from, as well as another egg which the [[lake guardians]], {{p|Uxie}}, {{p|Azelf}}, and {{p|Mesprit}}, hatched from. It could also recreate these eggs if it wanted to. Because of this, Arceus is thought to be one of the longest-lived Pokémon species, if not the oldest Pokémon in existence. In ''[[M12|Arceus and the Jewel of Life]]'', Arceus is portrayed as having powers such as bringing back things that it once destroyed, making certain things vanish into thin air, halting time, and overturning the very laws of nature. In the same movie, it is said to "feed" off the energy of its Plates. 
[[File:Arceus ruins art.png|thumb|250px|right|Arceus recreating the {{pkmn|egg}} of one of the [[Pokémon of myth]] in the [[Sinjoh Ruins]]]]
Arceus does not suffer fools gladly and will attack in a violent rampage if betrayed or deceived. It also holds long grudges if betrayed by those it considered friends. In ''[[M18|Hoopa and the Clash of Ages]]'', it was shown to be able to stop the destruction caused by a space-time void. As shown in the {{aniseries|JN}} episode ''[[JN090|Showdown at the Gates of Warp!]]'', Arceus has the power to not only calm Dialga and Palkia, but also destroy the [[Red Chain]] controlling them. It can release {{m|Judgment|countless shots of light}} that disintegrate the landscape around it. Arceus can change its [[type]] at will to adapt to a situation through the use of its [[Plate]]s or type-specific [[Z-Crystal]]s. Arceus also has the power to split in two, creating a piece of itself to exist outside of its realm, which is implied to be its physical form—only a piece of its whole being—while its true form is unknown and incomprehensible.

Arceus was known to care for and safeguard the planet in ancient times, protecting the world from cataclysms such as meteors, and it would show gratitude and compassion to those who treated it with kindness. In modern times, Arceus continues to watch over the world and wishes for people and Pokémon to work together in the face of adversity. Even when it is needed, it only gives hints on how to solve problems instead of directly interfering. Arceus can also give its blessing to other Pokémon through bolts of light, making them bigger and more powerful, as seen with the [[ancient hero]]'s 10 Pokémon companions. This blessing is passed down through family lines, as seen with the descendants of the hero's Pokémon: the [[noble Pokémon]] and {{hi|ride Pokémon}} worshiped by the people of [[Hisui]]. 

In {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, Arceus transformed a normal cellphone into an [[Arc Phone]], a device that allows humans to communicate with it through text messages. Arceus also has the power to appear in dreams and create a variety of Pokémon to serve as challenges, as seen in [[Eternal Battle Reverie]]. In {{g|Masters EX}}, through the [[Sync stone ultimate|sync stones ultimate]], Arceus can give its blessing to a {{pkmn|Trainer}} it deems worthy, transforming their outfits into costumes known as [[arc suit]]s. As a result, their [[sync pair]] is blessed as well, granting them a {{DL|Sync move|Divine moves|divine move}} over their normal [[sync move]]. In ''Arceus and the Jewel of Life'', using its [[Earth Plate|Earth]], [[Splash Plate|Splash]], [[Meadow Plate|Meadow]], [[Zap Plate|Zap]], and [[Draco Plate|Draco Plates]], Arceus created the [[Jewel of Life]], a powerful artifact capable of turning a desolate land into a rich and fertile one. 

Like the Pokémon it created, Arceus also resides in another dimension, a [[Dimension#Arceus' realm|realm beyond time and space]] itself. There, it appears in a form made of golden light, shaped like the silhouette of its normal appearance. This could possibly be its true form. It was also shown to be [[Talking Pokémon|capable of human speech]], stating that "Arceus" is simply the name [[human]]s call it. The ancient Sinnoh people worshiped it, referring to it as "almighty Sinnoh," "great Sinnoh," and "might of Sinnoh," with the term "Sinnoh" later on becoming the name of the [[region]]. The [[Diamond Clan]] and [[Pearl Clan]] also worshipped it, though they mistook {{p|Dialga}} and {{p|Palkia}} respectively for Arceus. In ancient myths, it is said that the [[Origin Ore]], an ore of mysterious power, contains the power of Arceus itself. 

In [[Alola]], the [[Aether Foundation]] used Arceus's data, collected from myths and legends from [[Canalave City]]'s [[Canalave Library|library]], during the [[Beast killer project]] to create the [[artificial Pokémon]] {{P|Silvally|Type: Full}}. Equipped with the {{A|RKS System}}, an {{a|RKS System|Ability}} similar to Arceus's {{A|Multitype}}, it was developed to protect Alola from [[Ultra Beast|Ultra Beasts]]. However, the project was deemed a failure and was later abandoned, and Type: Full's ability was sealed with a control helmet, which caused it to [[Devolution|devolve]] and be renamed {{p|Type: Null}}. 

Arceus is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Judgment}}. It is also able to use charged-up versions of the [[Pokémon of myth]]'s signature moves ({{m|Roar of Time}}, {{m|Spacial Rend}} and {{m|Shadow Force}}), as seen in its boss battle in Pokémon Legends: Arceus. Additionally, Arceus is the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Multitype}} as an [[Ability]]. 

===Forms===
Arceus has eighteen different forms, one for each [[type]].

Thanks to its [[Ability]], Arceus is capable of changing its form and [[type]] according to the [[Plate]] or type-specific [[Z-Crystal]] that it wields; its eyes, underbelly, face, hooves, snout, gems, and cross-like wheel all change color to match its current type.

===NPC appearances===
[[File:Arceus LA.png|thumb|250px|{{ga|Arceus}} in {{g|Legends: Arceus}}]]
* {{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}}: Arceus appears when [[Dark Matter]] begins trying to take the [[Tree of Life]] to the sun, leading the other Pokémon in attempting to stop its ascent. He is able to telepathically reach the player thanks to {{p|Mewtwo}} and transports them to the [[Tree of Life: Roots|Tree of Life's roots]] to confront Dark Matter. When Dark Matter regenerates itself and sends out a massive shockwave, Arceus and the other [[Legendary Pokémon]] gathered to stop the Tree of Life are immediately turned to stone. After Dark Matter is defeated, Arceus will remain at the top of {{OBP|Destiny Tower|Super Mystery Dungeon}}.
* {{g|Legends: Arceus}}: {{ga|Arceus}} is the titular character of the game. It sends the [[player character]] [[Time travel|back in time]] to the [[Hisui]] region and gives them the mission of seeking out all Pokémon in Hisui. Throughout the game, Arceus occasionally communicates with and assists the player via the [[Arc Phone]].
* {{g|Masters EX}}: While not physically seen, Arceus plays a notable role during the eponymously named [[Arceus Arc]] as the creator of [[sync stone ultimate|sync stones ultimate]]. Asking the people of [[Pasio]] to demonstrate their bond with their Pokémon to it, Arceus grants [[sync pair]]s holding sync stones ultimate new costumes dubbed [[arc suit]]s if the aforementioned bond is strong enough.

===Form data===
Arceus has multiple different forms that it switches between with its [[Ability]] {{a|Multitype}}, with each of its forms having a different [[type]]. In total, it has eighteen different forms, one for each type. Though most of its forms were introduced in [[Generation IV]], its {{type|Fairy}} form was introduced in [[Generation VI]], along with the Fairy-type as a whole.

By default, Arceus is in its {{type|Normal}} form. If it [[held item|hold]]s (or, in {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, is exposed to) a [[Plate]] or type-specific [[Z-Crystal]], it changes its form to be the same type as the type the Plate or Z-Crystal corresponds to.

In games besides {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, Arceus's [[signature move]] {{m|Judgment}} is Normal-type by default, but changes to match the type of the Plate that it holds (being unaffected by Z-Crystals). In Legends: Arceus, the type of Judgment is directly determined by Arceus's form, such that its type always matches that of Arceus; additionally, Arceus can change its form during a {{pkmn|battle}} using the [[Legend Plate]]. After being exposed to the Legend Plate, it will be in its Normal-type form by default and change its form before using {{m|Judgment}} to have a type advantage over the target, which also changes Judgment's type to match Arceus's. When determining the type that it changes into, any double weaknesses that the target may have are prioritized, followed by a type that resists the target's primary type (prioritizing immunities), then a type that resists the target's secondary type (again prioritizing immunities); if multiple types are equally valid, one of them is chosen at random. Arceus reverts to its Normal-type form when the battle ends. If Arceus is deposited into {{g|HOME}} while in any of its alternate forms, it reverts to its Normal-type form; if it is under the effects of the Legend Plate when deposited into HOME, these effects wear off.

In addition to its changing type, Arceus's [[Pokéathlon]] performance differs depending on its form, and it can only learn {{m|Draco Meteor}} from a [[Move Tutor]] while in its {{type|Dragon}} form (though it can learn it via [[TM]] in any form).

[[File:493-Unknown.png|thumb|???-type Arceus sprite]]
In the [[Generation IV]] games, there is an unused {{type|???}} Arceus, but it cannot be legitimately obtained in the games, as there is no ???-type Plate. Due to how its Ability would automatically turn any Arceus without a Plate into a Normal-type Pokémon in Generation IV, a ???-type Arceus [[cheating|hacked]] into the game will be treated as Normal-type. This form was removed in [[Generation V]] due to the removal of the ??? type.

Prior to {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, Arceus's alternate forms were not registered separately in the [[Pokédex]].

In [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon (WiiWare)]], Arceus will be present in its Water, Electric or Fire-type form, depending on the game, as Plates do not exist. In [[Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon]], only its Normal-type form is available, with Multitype serving a different function.

==In animation==
[[File:Arceus M12.png|thumb|250px|Arceus in ''[[M12|Arceus and the Jewel of Life]]'']]
===Main series===
====Major appearances====
=====[[Arceus (M12)]]=====
Arceus debuted in ''[[M12|Arceus and the Jewel of Life]]''. It was angry at the people of [[Michina Town]] for [[Damos]]'s unwitting betrayal of it in ancient times, and so it attempted to destroy the world. When {{Ash}}, {{ashfr}}, and [[Sheena]] were teleported by {{mov|Dialga}} to ancient times, they directly influenced the event, changing the future for the better so that Arceus would stop its destruction.

=====Other=====
Arceus appeared in ''[[M18|Hoopa and the Clash of Ages]]''. Following the devastating incident at [[Dahara City]], Ash, his friends, [[Baraz]], [[Meray]], and {{an|Hoopa}} saw it floating in the sky before it soared away.

Arceus appeared in [[Pokémon: The Arceus Chronicles]], where it and the {{an|lake guardians}} assisted Ash and his friends in stopping a rampaging {{p|Heatran}} that had engulfed the [[Flame Plate]] acquired by Team Galactic with its {{a|Flash Fire}} [[Ability]].

====Minor appearances====
Arceus made its animated series debut as a silhouette in ''[[JN090|Showdown at the Gates of Warp!]]''. It was called upon by Ash, his friends, their [[Pokémon multiverse#Pokémon Journeys: The Series|alternate world]] counterparts, and the people in both of their worlds to help stop {{OBP|Dialga|recurring}} and {{OBP|Palkia|recurring}}'s fight and destroy the [[Red Chain]] that was forcing them to battle.

[[File:Arceus Adventures.png|thumb|200px|left|Arceus in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
[[File:Arceus Multitype Adventures.png|thumb|Arceus's various forms in Pokémon Adventures]]
===Movie adaptations===
Arceus appears as a central character in the {{ma|Arceus and the Jewel of Life}} manga adaptation, reprising its role from the {{pkmn|movie}}. After Arceus saved the world from a meteor, [[Damos]] took care of it. It gave Damos the [[Jewel of Life]] to make the land of [[Michina Town]] rich and fertile. Damos then "betrayed" Arceus, and it has been outraged ever since.

===Pokémon Adventures===
{{main|Arceus (Adventures)}}
In the {{MangaArc|HeartGold & SoulSilver}}, Arceus appears as one of the main antagonists, where it plans on destroying humanity due to its mistrust of humans. It was the target of [[Team Rocket]]'s plans to create {{p|Dialga}}, {{p|Palkia}}, and {{p|Giratina}}. It first appeared in ''[[PS450|With a Little Help From Hitmonchan]]''.
{{-}}

==In the TCG==
{{main|Arceus (TCG)}}
Arceus appears in the TCG in all {{TCG|type}}s but {{TCG|Dragon}} and {{TCG|Fairy}}. Cards based on Arceus first appeared in the {{TCG|Platinum: Arceus|Arceus}} expansion set, which were printed with a rule that allows players to have as many Arceus cards in their deck as they like.

==Other appearances==
===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U]]===
[[File:Arceus 3DS trophy SSB4.png|thumb|150px|Arceus trophy in ''Super Smash Bros. for 3DS'']]
Arceus appears as a {{i|Poké Ball}} summon where it uses {{m|Gravity}} to produce a shockwave that brings opponents downwards.

====Trophy information====
Arceus appears as a trophy in both versions.

''[[Sinnoh myths#The Original Story|A Pokémon said to have hatched from an egg that appeared from nothing. Newly hatched, it created the world and the sky.]] Its Gravity attack will bring any fighter in midair crashing down to earth. No ground below you? Looks like you're going to go plummeting off the stage as if you'd been hit by a Meteor Smash! ''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Arceus appears as a Pokémon summoned from the Poké Ball, retaining its behavior from the previous game. It also appears as a {{sbw|Spirits (characters)|Spirit}}.

==Trivia==
<!--Please do not add trivia referring to the episode of House which mentioned Arceus. That belongs on the page "List of references to Pokémon in popular culture", not here.-->
* Arceus was designed by [[Takao Unno]].<ref>Creator profile on Takao Unno in the [[Pokémon Trading Card Game Illustration Collection]], p. 182: "He has created the designs for Garchomp, Croagunk, Arceus and others." ([https://twitter.com/Lewchube/status/1581735619637948416 archive])</ref>
* Arceus has the highest base stat total of all Normal-type {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} and the highest base stat total of any Pokémon in its base form.
* In [[Generation IV]], it was impossible to legitimately give Arceus more than 100 [[EV]]s in any stat, since it was only ever distributed at [[level]] 100. Prior to Generation V, level 100 Pokémon could not gain EVs through battling because they could not gain [[experience]].
* Arceus is the only pre-[[Generation V]] Pokémon to never officially receive a [[List of Pokémon by Diamond & Pearl Battle Pokédex number|DPBP number]]. {{p|Kadabra}}, which was not released as a TCG card during the DPBP era, is assumed to be #070, as {{p|Abra}} and {{p|Alakazam}} are #069 and #071, respectively.
* Arceus received the most votes of all pre-Generation V Pokémon in the {{g|Global Link}} [[List of Pokémon Global Link promotions/Pokémon#Arceus|promotion]] poll in both the Japanese poll and the international (non-Japanese and non-Korean) poll.
* Prior to [[Generation VII]], Arceus was classified by Pokédex color sorting as gray.
* In {{game|Diamond and Pearl|s}}, Arceus can be encountered without the use of the [[Azure Flute]] via a combination of [[Tweaking]] and the [[Pal Park Retire glitch]]. In addition, Arceus can be encountered an unlimited amount of times with this method, unlike {{p|Darkrai}} and {{p|Shaymin}}.
** This has been remedied in {{game|Platinum}}, however, as the player can no longer freely move in the "void".
* Arceus is the first [[Mythical Pokémon]] to be obtainable in-game in the core series without an event more than once.
* According to the {{pkmn|animated series}} [[dub]]'s then-voice director [[Tom Wayland]], the dub chose to pronounce Arceus with {{wp|Hard and soft C|a hard c instead of a soft c}} due to concerns over the latter pronunciation's potential {{wp|arse|implications}} in British English-speaking territories.
** This pronunciation is also reflected in the name of the [[Ability]] RKS System.
[[File:Space Globe artwork S.png|thumb|150px|Space Globe]]
[[File:Company Icon RKS Laboratories.png|thumb|150px|Icon for RKS Laboratories]]
* Ever since Arceus's debut, certain aspects of the Pokémon series have made use of its iconography.
** In [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky]], the [[Space Globe]] (Japanese: じくうのオーブ ''Space-Time Orb'') is an item that is described as the ultimate globe that holds the power to pass through space and time. It resembles Arceus's attached wheel and can be found on a statue of Arceus.
** According to {{p|Type: Null}} and {{p|Silvally}}’s [[Pokédex entry|Pokédex entries]], Arceus served as the inspiration for the {{a|RKS System}}, which is Silvally’s [[signature Ability]]. It allows Silvally to change its [[type]] when holding a [[Memory]] of any kind, which is similar to how Arceus’s {{a|Multitype}} allows Arceus to change type when holding a [[Plate]] or a type-specific [[Z-Crystal]].
*** Arceus and Silvally have similar {{Shiny}} colorations, swapping their usual white to a light gold.
** The name of the Ability RKS System is a reference to Arceus, with its English name being similar to the pronunciation of "Arceus". In {{pmin|Germany|German}}, {{pmin|Spain|Spanish}}, {{pmin|France|French}}, and {{pmin|Italy|Italian}}, its name is instead a reference to Arceus's {{pkmn|category}}, the Alpha Pokémon.
*** The company {{DL|Poké Job|List of companies|RKS Laboratories}} (Japanese: アルセウス{{ruby|製薬|せいやく}} ''Arceus Pharma'') in [[Galar]] has a logo similar to the rings on Arceus's body, furthering the connection.
* Despite being a [[Mythical Pokémon]], Arceus has sometimes been [[Terminology of Legendary and Mythical Pokémon|treated]] as a [[Legendary Pokémon]].
** Arceus is called a Legendary Pokémon by {{mas|Norman}} in the "Challenge the Normal Types" [[Daily Type Rotation]] event of {{g|Masters EX}}.
** The official English website of {{g|Legends: Arceus}} used to refer to Arceus as a Legendary Pokémon, which was later corrected to Mythical Pokémon as of September 28, 2021.<ref>Archive of [[Pokémon Legends: Arceus]] official website ([https://web.archive.org/web/20210818132639/https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon/ August 18, 2021]; [https://web.archive.org/web/20210928190642/https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon/ September 28, 2021])</ref> On the Japanese website, it has been referred to as a Mythical Pokémon from the beginning.<ref>[https://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/legends_arceus/ja/pokemon/210818_08/ Pokémon LEGENDS アルセウス]</ref>
* While using the [[Legend Plate]], Arceus will never transform back into the [[Normal (type)|Normal-type]], as nothing is weak to Normal.
* Arceus is the only Pokémon to narrate the introduction for a [[core series]] game.
* In Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Arceus's summary will say it was met at the [[Temple of Sinnoh]], despite being fought and obtained in the [[Hall of Origin]].
* Arceus was the only Pokémon first introduced during the DPt era of the Japanese [[Pokémon Trading Card Game]]. In the international TCG, Arceus and [[Shaymin (TCG)|Shaymin]] were both introduced in the Platinum series. <!-- ...What is this trying to say? Can someone more familiar with the TCG make this more understandable? -->
* The [[origin mark]] for Legends: Arceus [[File:Arceus mark.png|30px]] and the symbols for the {{TCG|Platinum: Arceus|Arceus}} expansion [[File:SetSymbolArceus.png|30px]] and the {{TCG|Brilliant Stars}} expansion [[File:SetSymbolBrilliant Stars.png|30px]] resemble Arceus's rings.
* Arceus's {{Type|Fairy}} form is the only Pokémon introduced after [[Generation IV]] to exist in {{g|Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl}}.
* In Pokémon Legends: Arceus, Arceus is the only Pokémon that can be registered in the player's [[Pokédex]] and have a [[Research task (Legends: Arceus)#Research level|research level]] of 0 at the same time.

===Origin===
Arceus appears to be particularly based on a {{wp|creator deity}}, present in many world cultures. Arceus also appears to draw significant inspiration from {{wp|Classical Greece}}, evident in the (putative) onomastic nod to {{wp|Zeus}}, ruler of Mount Olympus; in the ancient Greek style settings that frequently frame its epiphanies, such as rows of classical columns, stepped stone platforms, and straight processional approaches typical of Greek sanctuaries; and in the Classical Greek styling favored by Arceus devotees such as {{wp|Volo}}, with tunic-like layering and a {{wp|himation}}-like draped cloak. Its cosmogonic emergence “from an egg” resonates with the {{wp|Orphic Egg}} and the birth of {{wp|Phanes|Phanes/Protogonos}}, as well as the broader {{wp|World egg}} motif found across numerous creation myths. The gold, cross-spoked ring fused around a white, near-abstract body operates as a built-in nimbus or solar crown in the manner of {{wp|Helios}} or a stylized {{wp|Halo (religious iconography)|halo}}, a widespread religious icon used to denote holy, divine, or sacred figures and, at various periods, rulers, heroes, and saints. The triadic delegation of domains (time, space, distortion) parallels the classical division of realms among Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades, while Giratina’s banishment functions as a {{wp|Tartarus|Tartarean}} containment of rebellious force.

Based on its appearance and attack animations, Arceus may be modeled on a variety of animals, such as members of {{wp|Equidae}}, {{wp|Camelidae}}, or {{wp|Giraffidae}}, and/or fantastical beings, such as the {{wp|Centaurs}}, the {{wp|Sleipnir}}, the {{wp|Qilin}}, the {{wp|Uchchaihshravas}} or the {{wp|Longma}}. The [[Pokédex]] entry that states Arceus shaped the world with its multiple arms may also reference or be inspired by the many-armed {{wp|Bodhisattva}} {{wp|Avalokiteśvara}} in {{wp|Buddhism}} or by the many-armed {{wp|Hecatoncheires}} of {{wp|Greek mythology}}.

====Name origin====
Arceus may be a combination of αρχή ''{{wp|Arche|arkhé}}'' (Ancient Greek for ''origin'' and ''authority'') or ''{{wp|alpha}}'' and ''{{wp|deus}}'' (Latin for ''god'') or ''{{wp|Zeus}}'' (king of the gods in Greek mythology). It may also involve ''arcane'', ''aureus'' (Latin for golden), ''{{wp|arc}}'', ''arcesso'' (Latin for ''I summon''), ''{{wp|Archeus}}'' (an aspect of the astral plane), or ''{{wp|Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos}}'' (the origin state of the universe in Greek mythology, often personified as the first primordial deity).
