'''Kingler''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''キングラー''' ''Kingler'') is a {{type|Water}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Krabby}} starting at [[level]] 28.

Kingler can [[Gigantamax]] into '''Gigantamax Kingler''' if it has the {{DL|Gigantamax|Gigantamax Factor}}.

==Biology==
Kingler is a {{wp|crustacean}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} resembling a {{wp|crab}}. Its {{a|Shell Armor|strong shell}} serves as a natural armor and covers the outside of its body, featuring a red upper half and a light tan lower half. Its upper half is topped with six tall, thin spikes that resemble a crown. Its light tan arms are also connected to its upper body. Its lower half doubles as its jaw with six fangs overlapping its upper body. Its two outer fangs are much larger than the inner four and are roughly half as tall as Kingler's entire body. Its hips visibly protrude from its lower body and connect to its four long, thin legs. Each leg has a single, claw-like foot. Kingler's main features are its orange pincers. Its left claw is roughly twice as large as the other and is as hard as steel.

Kingler is often found on the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Water's-edge Pokémon|edges of water}}, usually the ocean. Its powerful claws have 10,000 horsepower and are capable of prying open the shells of {{p|Shellder}} and {{p|Cloyster}}. While Kingler's large, left claw is its main tool for offensive maneuvers, it is so large and heavy that Kingler can barely lift it. It causes balancing problems and Kingler may quickly become fatigued from continuous use. However, it has been shown to communicate with other Kingler by waving its pincers around.

Prior to [[Generation III]], Kingler and its pre-evolved form, {{p|Krabby}}, were the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Crabhammer}}.

===Forms===
Kingler has a [[Gigantamax]] form.

As Gigantamax Kingler, it has gained a larger, spikier appearance. Three red clouds float around the crown spikes on its head and the white sclera of its eyes are bright red. It now has foaming bubbles around its mouth in the shape of a mustache and long beard. The left pincer of Kingler has become much larger and its arms and legs have become longer as a result of Gigantamaxing. There is white, striped armor similar to teeth inside the pincers. The arms and legs both have several spikes. Kingler's claw-like feet have become orange and straighter.

The left pincer of Gigantamax Kingler can destroy anything it hits. The bubbles it releases are strongly alkaline. Should any opponent be struck by the bubbles, their bodies will quickly melt away.

Gigantamax Kingler is the only known Pokémon capable of using the [[G-Max Move]] {{m|G-Max Foam Burst}}.

A Kingler appeared in ''[[JNM15|Getting More than You Battled For!]]''.

Anne]], under the ownership of [[Team Rocket Trio|Harry]] in ''[[PS038|Long Live the Nidoqueen!?]]''.

A Kingler appeared in ''[[PS179|The Last Battle XIII]]'' as one of the Pokémon sent to participate in the fight in [[Ilex Forest]].

Much later, in ''[[PS276|My, My, My Mimic]]'', a Kingler is shown being {{pkmn2|caught}} by [[Carr]] to try to ambush {{adv|Red}} and {{adv|Blue}}, but it is frozen and beaten by the newly arrived [[Lorelei]].

==Trivia==
* Kingler shares its {{pkmn|category}} name with {{p|Scizor}}. They are both known as the Pincer Pokémon, though Scizor was originally called the Scissors Pokémon.
* Kingler's number in the [[National Pokédex]] and the [[List of Pokémon by Galar Pokédex number|Galar Pokédex in Sword and Shield]] are the same: 099.
* Many of Kingler's [[Pokédex entry|Pokédex entries]] mention its claws having the crushing power of 10,000 horsepower. In actuality, horsepower is a unit of power which is energy divided by time—not related to pressure in any way. More fitting units would be {{wp|pounds per square inch}} (U.S. customary) and {{wp|Pascal (unit)|pascals}} (SI). 
* For unknown reasons, Kingler's front sprite in {{game|Blue| (Japanese)|Japanese Pokémon Blue}} appears to depict its two pincers at the same size. This is also carried to localizations of {{game|Red and Blue|s}}. In {{game|Yellow}}, Kingler's sprite uses the same design with one oversized pincer as {{game|Red and Green|s}}, which would then be carried to all future games.

===Origin===
Kingler appears to be very similar to a {{wp|fiddler crab}} or a {{wp|terrestrial crab}} of the genus ''{{wp|Cardisoma}}'', which usually have one claw larger than the other. Crabs from the ''{{wp|Eriphioidea}}'' family also share this trait, with one of its members, ''{{wp|Pseudocarcinus gigas}}'', being one of the largest crab species in the world. It may also draw inspiration from pliers and hammers. Conceptually, its crown of spikes and its name may allude to the {{wp|king crab}}.

Its [[Gigantamax]] form may be based on {{wp|Japanese spider crab}}s with a bubble beard, which may be a reference to the fact that crabs blow bubbles to keep oxygen flowing to the gills when they are out of the water. It also resembles a bearded {{wp|king}}.

====Name origin====
Kingler may be a combination of ''{{wp|king crab}}'' and ''angler''. It may also involve ''{{wp|fiddler crab}}''.
