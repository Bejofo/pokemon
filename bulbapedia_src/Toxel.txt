'''Toxel''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''エレズン''' ''Eleson'') is a dual-type {{2t|Electric|Poison}} [[baby Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation VIII]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Toxtricity}} starting at [[level]] 30. The {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Toxtricity|form}} it evolves into depends on its [[Nature]] ([[Mint]]s only change the effect of a Nature rather than changing the Nature, and therefore do not change the Evolution).
* Toxel evolves into Toxtricity '''Amped Form''' if its Nature is Hardy, Brave, Adamant, Naughty, Docile, Impish, Lax, Hasty, Jolly, Naive, Rash, Sassy, or Quirky.
* Toxel evolves into Toxtricity '''Low Key Form''' if its Nature is Lonely, Bold, Relaxed, Timid, Serious, Modest, Mild, Quiet, Bashful, Calm, Gentle, or Careful.

==Biology==
Toxel is a small, quadrupedal, purple, lizard-like [[Baby Pokémon|baby]] {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. It has a lightning bolt-like protrusion on its forehead, along with four conical spikes surrounding its head. It has violet eyes with black pupils and white sclerae. Toxel typically has its light purple tongue sticking out of its mouth. Its cheeks are marked with a very pale whitish lavender spot on each side. Its chest also has a pale lavender-white spot, heavily resembling a baby's bib. Its lower half is light purple with lines running down the sides, resembling a diaper and entirely covering its short, tapering tail. Its arms and legs have two stubby fingers and toes each, with pale white spots under the toes and palms. Toxel also has two white spots on its back, just below its head.

Toxel is able to drink dirty water and filter it into a poison that is harmless to it. By manipulating the chemical makeup of this poison, it can produce electricity, which, while having weak voltage, causes a tingling paralysis on whoever touches it. Toxel's poison and electricity are stored on two different sacs inside its body, but are both relayed through its skin. It has a selfish, attention-seeking nature. Toxel is known to throw tantrums as a result of this. As noted in the  [[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]], Toxel tends to throw tantrums even during its sleep. Some people might feel the urge to cradle and soothe Toxel, but it instinctively releases poison from its skin, which can cause a tingling sensation for anyone who hugs it. It is advisable to observe Toxel from a safe distance for this reason. Toxel has four different sleep styles: ''Nursing Sleep'', ''Stretching Sleep'', ''Temper Tantrum Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''.

===Evolution===
Toxel evolves into {{p|Toxtricity}}.

==Trivia==
* No other {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} have the same [[List of Pokémon with unique type combinations|type combination]] as Toxel and its evolved form.
* Toxel is the only Pokémon with a base stat total of 242.
* Toxel is the first [[baby Pokémon]] introduced since [[Generation IV]], and is the only baby Pokémon to be introduced alone in a [[generation]].
* Among the natures Toxel can have, if it has one that lowers the Attack stat, it will always evolve into Low-Key Form Toxtricity; likewise, if Toxel has a nature that lowers the Special Defense stat, it will always evolve into Amped Form Toxtricity.
* Toxel and its Evolution were designed by [[Yusuke Kozaki]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/kymg/status/1341384533459910656 Tweet by コザキユースケ/Yusuke Kozaki (@kymg).] Posted on December 22, 2020.</ref>

===Origin===
Toxel may be based on different {{wp|lizard}} and {{wp|frog}} species, mainly a {{wp|poison dart frog}} due to its {{t|Poison}} typing and toxic skin. It may also be based on a human baby as its bottom-half closely resembles a diaper, the white spot on its chest is similar to a bib, and it also crawls on its hands and has temper tantrums. The spikes on Toxel's head make it resemble an {{wp|Ankylosaurus}}. The two white circles on its back are based on {{wp|Mongolian spot}}s.<ref>[https://twitter.com/kymg/status/1423593378059411458 Tweet by コザキユースケ/Yusuke Kozaki (@kymg).] Posted on August 6, 2021.</ref>

====Name origin====
Toxel may be a combination of ''toxic'', ''toddle'', ''cell'', ''electric'', and ''little''.

Eleson may be a combination of ''electric'' and ''poison''.
