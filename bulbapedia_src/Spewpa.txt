'''Spewpa''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''コフーライ''' ''Kofuurai'') is a {{type|Bug}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation VI]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Scatterbug}} starting at [[level]] 9 and evolves into {{p|Vivillon}} starting at level 12. Scatterbug and Spewpa each have [[#Form data|20 visually indistinct forms]] that determine the {{fd|Vivillon|form}} of Vivillon they evolve into.

==Biology==
Spewpa is small, cocoon-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} mostly hidden by sharp white fur with square particles of red, black, and pale yellow in and around the fur. Poking out of the top of its fur is its large, round head. The head is light gray in the back with a darker gray face. There is a beige dot over each eye and the face is bisected by a thin, black line that ends in a beige triangle at the top of the head. Its eyes are also beige with square, black pupils.

In order to defend itself from predators such as {{p|Rufflet}}, Spewpa will bristle its fur or spray a poisonous black powder. Spewpa is a nomadic Pokémon, travelling across fields and mountains while building up energy for it to evolve. However, it generally inhabits the shadows of thickets.

===Evolution===
Spewpa evolves from {{p|Scatterbug}} and evolves into {{p|Vivillon}}.

===Form data===
{{p|Scatterbug}} and Spewpa each have 20 forms internally, one for each {{p|Vivillon}} pattern. This determines the {{fd|Vivillon|form}} of Vivillon they will eventually evolve into, and is determined when they are first generated; for {{pkmn|Egg}}s, this means the game in which the Egg was created, regardless of parents.

In [[Generation VI]] and [[Generation VII]], its internal form depends on which geographic location the user specified on the [[Nintendo 3DS]] at the time the save file was created. Due to {{DL|Software region|Nintendo 3DS|region locking}}, a Nintendo 3DS system can only pick from a certain subset of geographic locations, depending on which region the system is from. For a comprehensive list, see [[List of Nintendo 3DS country and region settings]].

In {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, all [[Pokémon breeding|hatched]] Scatterbug will evolve into Fancy Pattern Vivillon, regardless of [[Gift#Postcards|Postcard]] effects. Scatterbug and Spewpa caught with a Postcard active will evolve into the pattern of Vivillon corresponding to the Postcard. If a Scatterbug or Spewpa came from another game like {{g|GO}}, it will retain the pattern it was assigned in its original game.

==In animation==

===Main series===
====Major appearances====
Multiple Spewpa appeared in ''[[XY012|To Catch a Pokémon Smuggler!]]'', all of which had earlier evolved from Scatterbug, including one of them that {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} helped out. One of the Spewpa later [[Evolution|evolved]] into a Vivillon while battling with [[Dolan]]'s {{p|Diggersby}}, and the rest evolved afterwards.

Six Spewpa appeared in ''[[XY121|Seeing the Forest for the Trees!]]'' in the [[Kalos Route 20|Winding Woods]]. Ash and {{AP|Greninja}} had to save them from freezing in a blizzard, and later ended up saving one of the Spewpa from falling off a cliff. This helped them to master the Ash-Greninja form. Afterwards, they all evolved into Meadow Pattern Vivillon. Two of them reappeared in a flashback in ''[[XY139|Facing the Needs of the Many!]]'', ''[[XY140|Till We Compete Again!]]'', and ''[[JN108|Catching the Aura of Fate!]]'' as Spewpa.

====Minor appearances====
Spewpa debuted in ''[[XY001|Kalos, Where Dreams and Adventures Begin!]]''.

Three Spewpa appeared in ''[[XY084|Adventures in Running Errands!]]'', all under the ownership of a {{pkmn|Trainer}}.

A Trainer's Spewpa appeared in ''[[XY138|The First Day of the Rest of Your Life!]]''.

===POKÉTOON===

===Pokémon Adventures===
Two Spewpa were used by the [[Lumiose Press editor-in-chief]] in ''[[PS562|Pangoro Poses a Problem]]'', to stop {{adv|X}} from protecting [[Alexa]]. With their {{m|Rage Powder}}, the Spewpa prevented X's [[Marisso]] and [[Salamè]] from listening to X's commands. Eventually, both were defeated, but X's Pokémon were left exhausted afterward.

===After the Rain, Goomy.===

[[File:Spewpa SSB4.png|thumb|240px|Spewpa in [[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for 3DS.]]]]
Spewpa appears as a {{i|Poké Ball}} summon. It uses {{m|Stun Spore}} to temporarily stun any nearby opponents that attack it, but doesn't move otherwise.

[[File:Spewpa_3DS_trophy_SSB4.png|thumb|150px|Spewpa trophy in ''Super Smash Bros. for 3DS'']]
Spewpa also appears as a trophy in both versions of the game.

====Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''Spewpa, the Scatterdust Pokémon. This Bug-type Pokémon can harden its body to protect against attacks. If attacked in Smash Bros., it'll bristle up and paralyze its opponent with Stun Spore. However, it won't do anything if you don't attack it. Don't mess with it—it won't mess with you. ''

'''PAL''': ''Spewpa, the Scatterdust Pokémon. This Bug-type Pokémon can harden its body to protect against attacks. In this game, it might bristle up and paralyse you with Stun Spore. "How ever can I avoid such a terrible fate?", you ask? Just leave it alone. Don't mess with Spewpa, and Spewpa won't mess with you. ''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Spewpa returns as a Pokémon summoned from the Poké Ball, retaining the same behavior from the previous game.
{{-}}

==Trivia==
* Spewpa and its evolutionary relatives are the only:
** {{type|Bug}} Pokémon introduced in [[Generation VI]].
** {{cat|Generation VI Pokémon}} in the {{egg|Bug}} [[Egg Group]].
* Spewpa is [[List of Pokémon with unique base stat totals|the only Pokémon]] with a base stat total of 213.
* Spewpa can learn {{m|Iron Defense}} from a [[Move Tutor]], but its Evolution, {{p|Vivillon}}, cannot.
* Spewpa and its pre-evolved form, {{p|Scatterbug}}, are the only {{DL|List of Pokémon by color|black}} Bug-type Pokémon.

===Origin===
Spewpa is likely based on the larval forms of certain members of the {{wp|Tineidae}} family, such as the {{wp|carpet moth}} and {{wp|Tinea pellionella|case-bearing clothes moth}}, which construct snug cases of fibres and hairs that leave their heads exposed. The square powder on Spewpa's body might be based on {{wp|confetti}} or screen {{wp|pixel}}s.

Considering its evolutionary relatives, Spewpa may also represent a generic {{wp|pupa}} of a moth or butterfly, particularly {{wp|silkworm}} cocoons. The way it uses its hairs to protect itself from predation may be a reference to the {{wp|urticating hairs}} of some caterpillars that are incorporated into their cocoons for protection.

====Name origin====
Spewpa may be a combination of ''spew'' and ''{{wp|pupa}}''.

Kofuurai may be a combination of 小 ''ko'' (small) or 粉 ''ko'' (powder) and 風来人 ''furaijin'' (wanderer).
