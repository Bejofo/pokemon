'''Zacian''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ザシアン''' ''Zacian'') is a {{type|Fairy}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation VIII]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Zacian has a second {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Zacian|form}} activated by giving it a [[Rusted Sword]] to hold. Its original form, '''Hero of Many Battles''', will then become the dual-type {{2t|Fairy|Steel}} '''Crowned Sword'''.

Zacian is the [[game mascot]] of [[Pokémon Sword and Shield|Pokémon Sword]], appearing on its boxart in its Crowned Sword form. It is a member of the [[Legendary heroes|legendary heroes]] with {{p|Zamazenta}}.

It is associated with {{p|Eternatus}}, playing a role in stopping the [[Darkest Day]].

==Biology==
[[File:Zacian Zamazenta dormant.png|thumb|left|250px|Zacian's dormant state (right)]]
In its Hero of Many Battles form, Zacian is a large cyan lupine {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with yellow eyes, a tan underside, a lean frame, a pink tail, and pink braids going down the side of its body. Two pink fringes of fur are present on its back. There are battle scars on its shoulders, hips, back, and forehead, which reveal a tan coloration under the blue fur. Half of its left ear is also missing.

It is believed to be either the elder sister or rival of {{p|Zamazenta}}. In the past, Zacian was feared and respected by the people of [[Galar]]. 3000 years ago, it worked together with Zamazenta and [[First kings of Galar|two young humans]] to save the region from {{p|Eternatus}} and the [[Darkest Day]] it created, defeating the Gigantic Pokémon and forcing it back into slumber, which also caused pieces of its body imbued with its power to rain down throughout Galar in the form of [[Wishing Piece|Wishing Pieces]] and [[Wishing Star|Wishing Stars]]. It can also turn itself into a statue and slumber for eons alongside Zamazenta in the [[Slumbering Weald]]. Zacian can also cast illusions, including a projection of itself, even while it slumbers. Additionally, it is capable of flying. Even though it is not capable of [[Dynamax]]ing, Zacian may still go berserk when bombarded by [[Galar particle|Galar particles]]. As years passed, both Zacian and Zamazenta were forgotten by history, however, [[Sonia|Professor Sonia]] proved their existence by writing her first book: "[[Sonia's Book|Galar: A History]]", which details the discovery she and the [[Player character|player]] had in [[Stow-on-Side]].

Zacian is the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Intrepid Sword}} as its [[Ability]].

===Forms===
[[File:Zacian sheathed sword.png|thumb|200px|Zacian with its sword sheathed into one of its braids]]
Zacian has two forms: Hero of Many Battles and Crowned Sword.

Zacian can change into its Crowned Sword form by [[Held item|wielding]] its [[Rusted Sword]], it then absorbs metal particles in the air and uses them to form a golden armor over its body and transform the Rusted Sword into a longer, golden sword.

[[File:Zacian Behemoth Blade sword.png|thumb|left|250px|Zacian's [[Rusted Sword|sword]] transforms so it can use {{m|Behemoth Blade}}]]
In its Crowned Sword form, the fringes of fur on its back become wing-like armor and its braids grow to resemble ribbons. Additionally, its head is covered by a golden helmet, and it carries a golden sword decorated to resemble Zacian's colors; when using the move {{m|Behemoth Blade}}, the armor on Zacian's back combines with the sword to increase its size and power.

Zacian can sheathe its sword when not in use by wrapping it with its mane. Crowned Sword is Zacian's true form, and it is at its full power in this form. It is capable of cutting down anything in one strike, and its skills inspired awe in both its friends and foes. When together with {{p|Zamazenta}} in their Crowned forms, it can negate the mysterious power of [[Eternamax]] {{p|Eternatus}}, which prevents opposing Pokémon from attacking it.

Zacian attacks with graceful, swift, and captivating movements, which have been compared to a dance. It unleashes quick slashes that cannot be seen by the naked eye; those struck by its sword will be cut down before they can feel the pain. The sword it holds in its mouth can cut through anything, even the thick scales of {{type|Dragon}} Pokémon, as if they were paper. According to legends, in this form, it was known as the "Fairy King's Sword", due to its Typing and weapon.

Crowned Sword Zacian is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of using the move {{m|Behemoth Blade}}. When using Behemoth Blade, it is said to be able to cut the ocean in two.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon-galar-region/zacian/ Zacian | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref>

* Zacian and {{p|Zamazenta}}'s Hero of Many Battles forms have the same stat distribution.

===Origin===
Zacian may be based on {{wp|King Arthur}}'s sword {{wp|Excalibur}}. Its role as a warrior aiding a king may take inspiration on the {{wp|Knights of the Round Table}}. In addition, its feminine nature may be a reference to the {{wp|Lady of the Lake}}, the character responsible for giving King Arthur his sword, and its relationship with Zamazenta may allude to the relationship between King Arthur and his sister {{wp|Morgan le Fay}}. It otherwise resembles a {{wp|wolf}}, an animal once native to {{wp|Great Britain}} and an important heraldic symbol for noble families during the {{wp|Middle Ages}}. Its long, hanging blue fur resembles a {{wp|caparison}}, a cloth covering usually worn by warhorses during the {{wp|High Middle Ages}}.

The story of Zacian and Zamazenta retreating to the Slumbering Weald to recover from their wounds, and their return in the present day to save Galar, parallels the legend of {{wp|King Arthur's messianic return}}.

Zacian's sword's ability to cut through anything, with Zamazenta's shield resisting any attack, could be an example of an {{wp|irresistible force paradox}}. One of the most famous examples of this in folklore includes the Chinese tale of a peddler selling a spear and a shield with similar properties, only to be asked what would happen if the two items were to be used against one another. Another example tells of the Greek hunting hound {{wp|Laelaps (mythology)|Laelaps}}, which always caught its prey, being set upon {{wp|Teumessian fox}}, which could never be caught, and had to be turned into constellations to prevent the paradox.

Additionally, the crescent shapes on its sword while using Behemoth Blade may reference {{wp|Hati Hróðvitnisson}}, a wolf that chases after the Moon in Norse mythology.

====Name origin====
Zacian is derived from ''the cyan''.<ref>Shea, Brian (November 13, 2019). "[https://web.archive.org/web/20211018194709/https://www.gameinformer.com/feature/2019/11/13/going-big Going Big: The behind-the-scenes story of Pokémon’s next evolution]".

* The way in which "the" is transformed into "za" may be a reference to the substitution of the /ð/ phoneme ("th") to the /z/ phoneme, which is commonly made by speakers of languages which don't have the /θ/ phoneme originally, including Japanese. The substitution of "e" for "a" may also reflect the possible pronunciation of the "e" in "the" using the /ʌ/ or the /ə/ ("uh") phonemes, which may be represented by the "a" letter in many languages, including in the romanization of Japanese.
