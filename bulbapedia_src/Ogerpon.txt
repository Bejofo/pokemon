'''Ogerpon ''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''オーガポン''' ''Ogerpon'') is a {{type|Grass}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced during [[Generation IX]], in [[The Teal Mask]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Ogerpon has four [[#Form data|forms]], determined by the mask it is wearing, which also changes its type, each with their own unique [[Terastal phenomenon#Unique Terastallized states|Terastallized state]].
* While Ogerpon is wearing the [[Teal Mask]] by default, it is in its '''Teal Mask''' form, and is a pure {{type|Grass}} (regardless of whether it is in the Terastallized state or not).
* While Ogerpon is wearing the [[Wellspring Mask]], it is in its '''Wellspring Mask''' form, and is dual-type {{2t|Grass|Water}} normally, becoming pure {{t|Water}}-type in its Terastallized state.
* While Ogerpon is wearing the [[Hearthflame Mask]], it is in its '''Hearthflame Mask''' form, and is dual-type {{2t|Grass|Fire}} normally, becoming pure {{t|Fire}}-type in its Terastallized state.
* While Ogerpon is wearing the [[Cornerstone Mask]], it is in its '''Cornerstone Mask''' form, and is dual-type {{2t|Grass|Rock}} normally, becoming pure {{t|Rock}}-type in its Terastallized state.

Teal Mask Ogerpon is the [[game mascot]] of [[The Teal Mask]], appearing in [[The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero]].

It is associated with the [[Loyal Three]] and their leader {{p|Pecharunt}}.

==Biology==
Ogerpon is a predominantly green, humanoid [[Pokémon]]. Its green torso is spotted with white flowers and yellow dots, and it is capable of extending prehensile branches and vines of ivy. Its long legs have an outer layer of black, but otherwise appear as if split from a tree trunk: their innermost sides are flat and of a woody ash-brown color. The soles of its two-toed feet are also of this color, and show matching portions of {{wp|Dendrochronology|growth rings}}. Between the toes on each foot, two green leaves sprout, evoking the image of {{wp|Zori#Hanao|''hanao'' sandal thongs}}. Its torso is mostly covered by a large, green, multicolored cloak-like structure that extends from a stem on top of its head. This cloak frames its face with a large, black, thorny vine, the two uppermost thorns resembling horns. The cloak appears prehensile, and its "sleeves" serve as Ogerpon's arms, able to grasp and manipulate objects; Ogerpon is never seen without the cloak. Ogerpon has an orange face, yellow eyes with white, star-shaped pupils and small green leaves at the edges that loosely resemble eyelashes, a three-pointed leaf that serves as hair, small black markings on its eyebrows and cheeks, and two pointed fangs in its upper jaw. Its face is usually hidden behind [[:Category:Masks|one of its masks]], and in battle, it wields {{m|Ivy Cudgel|a large, spiky cudgel wrapped in ivy}}; these tools are stored under its cloak when not in use. Ogerpon is a female-only species with no male counterpart.
{{Spoilers}}
Ogerpon is a very intelligent Pokémon with a playful mischief-loving side. It's full of curiosity about the lives of people and other Pokémon, usually spending time with humans while wearing a mask to blend in with them in [[Kitakami]]'s [[Festival of Masks]]. It is known to often cause trouble, such as by stealing snacks from the [[Mossui Town|village]]’s food supply or making off with items that caught its eye.<ref>[https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon/ogerpon/ Scarlet and Violet | Ogerpon]</ref> It fights by confusing its opponents with its nimble movements and kicks, and it draws [[type]]-based energy from its masks, imbuing its cudgel with different elements. Ogerpon becomes weaker if its masks are taken away, and its full power can be restored to it by returning its masks. By using any of its masks, Ogerpon is capable of {{Tera}}stallizing itself without the need of a [[Tera Orb]], supposedly due to the masks being made of [[Tera Shard|Tera crystals]], just like Tera Orbs. This species is known to have a very long lifespan; {{ga|Ogerpon|one specimen}} is confirmed to have been alive for hundreds of years. Ogerpon is mortal enemies with the [[Loyal Three]] and their leader {{p|Pecharunt}}, mainly due to the group's actions towards it in the past. In [[Kitakami]] myths, it is described as "the ogre".

Ogerpon is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of using the move {{m|Ivy Cudgel}}. It is also the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Embody Aspect}} as an [[Ability]] in any of its [[Terastal phenomenon#Unique Terastallized states|Terastallized states]].

===Forms===
Ogerpon has four different forms, corresponding to each of its four masks, which accordingly change the color of its cloak, its vines, and the aura of its cudgel. Additionally, the way that Ogerpon attacks from both close-quarters, as well as at a long-distance range with its vines, differs depending on the forms. Each standard form also has a unique {{Tera|Terastallized state}} that causes a giant replica of the mask is formed by [[Terastal energy]] around the original, with ogresque crystal horns, floating in front of Ogerpon, and being so immense that it hides all but Ogerpon's legs when viewed from the front. Ogerpon's unique Terastallization comes from the intense emotions it feels, {{a|Embody Aspect|filling its heart and boosting its powers}}. Because Ogerpon's Tera Type is wholly determined by the energy in its mask, it cannot be changed at the [[Treasure Eatery]], unlike other Pokémon.

| colspan="4" | The [[Teal Mask]] is primarily teal and green in color, and sports a mischievous expression that is sometimes described as fearsome.<ref>https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/news/new_pokemon/</ref> The grinning mouth is tan, with two extensions beneath it that resemble pincers. On each side of the mouth is a group of three green leaves, each one larger than the leaf beneath. The top of the mask features five teal leaves that form a crown of sorts, with the four outer leaves each having a hole cut towards the center. The mask contains nine [[Tera Shard|Tera crystals]]: two that resemble squinting eyes, six as the "veins" of the green leaves, and one large, four-pointed star-shaped crystal set in the central teal leaf as the crown jewel.

When Ogerpon Terastallizes, a giant replica of the mask is formed by [[Terastal energy]] around the original and floats in front of Ogerpon, acting as a shield to it, the Terastal symbol appears in the crown jewel, two branching crystal horns protrude from its forehead, and the mouth opens up wider in a terrifying grin. Numerous green leaves and vines grow out from behind the sides of the giant mask.

The Teal Mask draws upon the power of grass; while wearing it, Ogerpon's Tera Type is always {{t|Grass}}. It is said to have the power to restore life to withered plants. Teal Mask Ogerpon will toy with its opponents with swift movements and kicking attacks.

| colspan="4" | The [[Wellspring Mask]] is predominantly blue and white in color, and sports a somber expression. The entire mask is framed by blue hair that forms a heart shape, with a streak of lighter blue hair on each side. The face is white with circular, light blue eyebrows, simple black lines for a closed mouth and eyes. The mask contains two [[Tera Shard|Tera crystals]] that resemble large tears beneath the eyes.

When Ogerpon Terastallizes, a giant replica of the mask is formed by [[Terastal energy]] around the original and floats in front of Ogerpon, acting as a shield to it, the mask's hair flares out to the sides, the Terastal symbol appears in its left tear, and two flat crystal horns protrude from its forehead. Water waves also flow out from behind the sides of the giant mask.

The Wellspring Mask draws upon the power of water; while wearing it, Ogerpon's Tera Type is always {{t|Water}}. With this mask, Ogerpon excels in both offense and defense, its unrelenting kicks and ivy strikes resembling the ceaseless gushes of spring water. It is said to be able to stop the flow of a river.

|-
| colspan="4" | The [[Hearthflame Mask]] is mainly red and orange in color, and sports an angry expression. Its whole shape and profile is flame-like, with a protruding brow of swirling flames and a bright orange mane bordering most of the mask. Its possesses black pupils within its eyes and a small amount of black coloration between the eyes and nose. Its mouth and nose are bright blue, and it has two sharply pointed fangs jutting from its lower jaw. The mask contains three [[Tera Shard|Tera crystals]]: two shaped like eyes around its pupils and a four-pointed star on its forehead.

When Ogerpon Terastallizes, a giant replica of the mask is formed by [[Terastal energy]] around the original and floats in front of Ogerpon, acting as a shield to it, the Terastal symbol appears in the crystal on its forehead, its eyes are surrounded by more black coloration, two sharp crystal horns protrude from its forehead, and its mouth opens up wide as if bellowing in rage. Bright-orange flames also erupt from behind the sides of the giant mask.

The Hearthflame Mask draws upon the power of fire; while wearing it, Ogerpon's Tera Type is always {{t|Fire}}. True to the mask's expression, Ogerpon becomes more aggressive while wearing it, mercilessly spearing its enemies with thorny ivy and bombarding them with the intensity of a hearth's fire. It is said to be capable of rousing a candle's flame into a raging inferno.

| colspan="4" | The [[Cornerstone Mask]] is mostly gray in color, and sports a joyful expression. It has a craggy profile, with uneven extensions towards the top of the mask. Its mouth prominently juts out, and has two large, black, blunt-tipped fangs that curve upward. Its eyes are yellow, it has a small, flat nose just over its mouth, and it has a bright-blue feature that begins behind its nose and curves upward beneath its eyes, forming a strange sort of moustache. The mask contains five [[Tera Shard|Tera crystals]]: two serving as pupils in its eyes and three as teeth between its black fangs.

When Ogerpon Terastallizes, a giant replica of the mask is formed by [[Terastal energy]] around the original and floats in front of Ogerpon, acting as a shield to it, the Terastal symbol appears in its right pupil, two craggy crystal horns protrude from its forehead, and its mouth opens up even more. Strands of diamond-shaped black hair also extend from the sides of the giant mask.

The Cornerstone Mask draws upon the power of stone; while wearing it, Ogerpon's Tera Type is always {{t|Rock}}. Ogerpon's defense brims with the solidarity of the cornerstones that support houses; its body becomes rock-solid and easily absorbs impacts, protecting it from all manner of attacks. It is said to be able to break even the hardest stone in two.

===Form data===
Ogerpon has four forms, corresponding to each of its four masks: the Teal Mask, Wellspring Mask, Hearthflame Mask, and Cornerstone Mask.

When {{Tera}}stallized, each form changes into a unique Terastallized state that causes the mask to transform, gain ogresque crystal horns, float in front of Ogerpon, and grow in size.

(Refer to the [[#Forms|Forms]] section for images of Ogerpon's unique Terastallized states.)

When not holding an item, Ogerpon is always in its standard [[Teal Mask]] form. Ogerpon can change into the [[Wellspring Mask]], [[Hearthflame Mask]], and [[Cornerstone Mask]] forms when holding the respective masks of the same names. Each of Ogerpon's other three mask forms has a different secondary [[type]]; Ogerpon's [[signature move]] {{m|Ivy Cudgel}} changes type to match this secondary type.

==Trivia==
* Ogerpon and all of its forms were designed by [[Hitoshi Ariga]].<ref name=Designer>[https://archive.is/Bj5mI Ariga confirming he designed Ogerpon, including all of its forms.]</ref>
* Ogerpon cannot have its {{Tera}} Type be changed under normal circumstances in {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}. Even if [[Cheating|the game is modified]] to force Ogerpon to have a different Tera Type, the game will {{DL|Game freeze|Softlocking|softlock}} upon trying to Terastallize, forcing the player to restart the console. It shares this distinction with {{p|Terapagos}}.
** This makes Ogerpon the only Pokémon available in {{g|Scarlet and Violet}} incapable of being {{type|Stellar}}.
** {{a|Illusion}}, {{a|Imposter}}, and {{m|Transform}} will also not work if either Ogerpon or the Pokémon with them Terastallizes.
* The types of all three non-default masked forms of Ogerpon were [[List of Pokémon with unique type combinations|unique type combinations]] prior to their introduction:
** [[Wellspring Mask]] Ogerpon's dual-type {{2t|Grass|Water}} was previously unique to {{p|Lotad}}'s evolutionary line.
** [[Hearthflame Mask]] Ogerpon's dual-type Grass/{{t|Fire}} was previously unique to {{p|Scovillain}}.
** [[Cornerstone Mask]] Ogerpon's dual-type Grass/{{t|Rock}} was previously unique to {{p|Lileep}}'s evolutionary line.
* Ogerpon in its Wellspring Mask form is the first Water-type Pokémon with a [[List of Pokémon by gender ratio|100% female ratio]]. The same is true for its Cornerstone Mask form and the Rock type.
* If Ogerpon is sent out during the battle against {{p|Pecharunt}} at the end of the [[Mochi Mayhem]] epilogue, Ogerpon will recognize it and react with distress and anger, yelling out "GRAH! Pon PON!!!" at it.
* Ogerpon is the first Pokémon that has never been a {{type|Normal}} to learn {{m|Follow Me}} by level-up, as the {{p|Clefairy}} and {{p|Togepi}} families were pure Normal prior to [[Generation VI]].
* Ogerpon is tied with {{p|Urshifu}} for the lowest non-increasable base stat total of all fully evolved [[Legendary Pokémon|Legendary Pokemon]] at only 550. {{p|Zygarde}} and {{p|Terapagos}} have [[Form|alternate forms]] with lower base stat totals, but these can be increased by switching to their other forms.

===Origin===
Ogerpon is based on 鬼 ''{{wp|oni}}'', creatures from Japanese folklore that often are referred to as demons or ogres in English. In particular, it may be based on the villainous oni who live on Onigashima from the story of ''{{wp|Momotarō}}'', albeit with Ogerpon as the hero instead of the villain. Given that the Land of Kitakami is inspired by {{wp|Tōhoku region|Northeast Japan}}, it may also be based on Akuro-ō, the Oni in the local {{jwp|坂上田村麻呂伝説|legend}}s of {{wp|Sakanoue no Tamuramaro}}. Its cudgel appears to be based on a {{wp|kanabō}}, a type of club often wielded by oni in myths.

The overall design of Ogerpon may draw inspiration from local festivals and folktales about ''oni'' in Northeast Japan. It may also be inspired by Onikenbai, or {{wp|Devil's Sword Dance}}, a traditional Buddhist ritual dance and {{wp|Kitakami Michinoku Traditional Dance Festival|festival}} from the real-life city named {{wp|Kitakami, Iwate|Kitakami}} in {{wp|Iwate Prefecture}}. Another inspiration may be {{wp|Namahage}} from {{wp|Akita Prefecture}}, where performers in ''oni'' masks and ''{{wp|Mino (straw cape)|mino}}'' received {{wp|Mochi}} from households in the 20th century but nowadays give away Mochi. This also ties to the [[Ogre Oustin']] minigame and the [[Mochi]] which can be gotten there. The Terastallized states of Ogerpon may be inspired by ''Nebuta'' floats of the {{wp|Aomori Nebuta Matsuri|Aomori Nebuta Festival}} from {{wp|Aomori Prefecture}}, which feature large {{wp|papier-mâché}} half statues of mythical or historical figures with exaggerated facial expression. The four masks may also have local inspiration from the Tōhoku region. The leaves on the Teal Mask may be inspired by the 丸に笹竜胆 ''maru-ni sasarindō'' {{wp|Mon (emblem)|mon}} on the attire of Kitakami Onikenbai. The [[Wellspring Mask]] may draw inspiration from the folktale of {{wp|Lake Tazawa}} and Tatsuko, where a maiden longing for eternal beauty is turned into a dragon and dives into the lake with much regret after parting with her mother and fellow villager. The item in the plot of [[The Teal Mask]] was brought by {{p|Munkidori}} to [[Six Wonders of Kitakami|Wisteria Pond]], the [[PKWorld#Kitakami|Pokémon world's equivalent]] of Lake Tazawa. The association of ''oni'' and the [[Hearthflame Mask|hearth]] may be inspired by a local legend of {{wp|Watanabe no Tsuna}} in {{wp|Shibata District, Miyagi|Ubagafutokoro}}, {{wp|Miyagi Prefecture}}, where {{wp|Ibaraki-dōji|the demon of Ichijō Modorihashi}} retrieved its severed limb from the residence of the hero and escaped along the pothook (''jizaikagi'') of the {{wp|irori}}. The [[Cornerstone Mask]] could be based on {{wp|Onigawara}}, roof ornamentations with the face of an Oni. Early examples of Onigawara with Oni face have been excavated from the {{wp|Isawa Castle|Isawa Castle site}} in Iwate.

The four masks worn by Ogerpon appear to be based on masks used in the {{wp|Nōgaku}} theatre, including {{wp|Noh}} and {{wp|Kyōgen}}, with strong ties to Buddhist and Shinto rituals. Together they may represent joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness (fulfilment) - the four moods of East Asian theatre from the {{wp|Confucianism|Confucian}} {{wp|Book of Rites}}; known as 喜怒哀楽 ''kidoairaku'' in Japanese.
*Specifically, the [[Teal Mask]] resembles the 翁面 ''okina-men'', a genre of masks that represents old men with a smiling or grinning face commonly used in {{jwp|式三番|Shiki-sanba}} performances at temples and shrines.
*The [[Wellspring Mask]] resembles the 女面 ''onna-men'', masks of female characters that usually depict a sorrowful or weeping face; and in its Terastallized state, the 生成 ''namanari'' mask, ''oni'' masks with short horns and a painful face, but less fierce than the more iconic ''{{wp|hannya}}'' mask. Ogerpon's Terastallization in this state may be inspired by the transformation of sorrowful, vengful, or envious women into {{wp|onryō}}, a common trope of the Noh theatre.
*The [[Hearthflame Mask]] resembles several genres of furious 鬼面 ''oni-men'', such as the 顰 ''shikami'' ("lion's frowning gaze") or the 獅子口 ''shishi-guchi'' ("lion's maw"). This is further evidenced by the mane-like flames around the mask in its Terastallized state.
*The [[Cornerstone Mask]] resembles the now-rare 仏面 ''butsu-men'' genre of Noh masks, including 天神 ''{{wp|Kami|Tenshin}}'' and 不動 ''{{wp|Acala|Fudō}}'', used to depict resolute and powerful deities who facilitate unworldly achievements or bring forth {{wp|Vipāka}}.
The fact that it has four masks could be inspired by the {{jwp|藤原千方の四鬼|four Oni summoned by Fujiwara no Chikata}}, a feudal lord who plotted high treason with the help of demons in a legend passed down in {{wp|Mie Prefecture}} and {{wp|Iwate Prefecture}}.

Ogerpon's plant-based body and orange fruit-like face may be based on a {{wp|citrus}} shrub, like its name suggests. Its face specifically resembles ''{{wp|dekopon}}'', a hybrid between ''{{wp|ponkan}}'' and ''{{wp|kiyomi}}''. It also appears to be based on {{wp|Hedera|ivy}}, although its thorny appearance is more similar to plants like {{wp|Rubus|bramble bush}}es. Its thorns may be also a visual pun on {{wp|Ibaraki-dōji}}, a mountain-dwelling oni whose name includes 茨 ''ibara'' (briar, thorn) and who is synonymous to the aforementioned demon of Ichijō Modorihashi. Its green face in its shiny coloration makes it resemble that of an unripe {{wp|orange (fruit)|orange}} or dekopon, which are typically a shade of green rather than the usual orange color. It may also draw inspiration from the ''{{wp|yuzu}}'', which has a larger variant called ''oni yuzu''. Its vines and the {{m|Ivy Cudgel}} could also be based on {{wp|Vitis|grapevines}}, the Japanese name of the move includes the name of a few kinds of grapevine. The inspiration from citrus fruits and grapes may be a reference to [[Naranja Academy|Naranja]] and [[Uva Academy]].

Ogerpon also seems to draw inspiration from ヤマンバ ''yamanba'' or マンバ ''manba'', styles that originated from ''{{wp|ganguro}}'', a fashion style that derivates from {{wp|''gyaru''}} subculture. The makeup worn in these fashion styles resembles Ogerpon's orange face. Sparkly eyes are also commonly associated with the gyaru subculture, just like the use of the suffix ''-pon'', presented in Ogerpon's name and cries during [[The Teal Mask]] dialogues. 山姥 ''{{wp|Yamanba}}'' (mountain hag) is also a ''{{wp|yōkai}}'' that, just like Ogerpon, dwells in a mountain.

====Name origin====
Ogerpon may be derived from ''{{wp|ogre}}'' and ''{{wp|ponkan}}'' or ''{{wp|dekopon}}'' (varieties of orange), as well as {{j|～ぽん}} ''-pon'', a cutesy suffix applied to names as a form of endearment.
