'''Koraidon''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''コライドン''' ''Koraidon'') is a dual-type {{2t|Fighting|Dragon}} [[Legendary Pokémon|Legendary]] [[Paradox Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation IX]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

It is said to be either an ancient relative of {{p|Cyclizar}} or a counterpart of it from a parallel timeline. It also has a futuristic variant, {{p|Miraidon}}.

Koraidon is the [[game mascot]] of {{pkmn|Scarlet and Violet|Pokémon Scarlet}}, appearing on the game's box art in its Apex Build. In the [[Scarlet Book]], it is also known as the "'''Winged King'''" (Japanese: '''ツバサノオウ''' ''Tsubasano'ou''). Along with Miraidon, it is considered part of the [[Paradox duo]] by fans.

==Biology== 
[[File:Apex Build Koraidon wings.png|thumb|left|250px|Apex Build Koraidon with its wings unfurled]]
Koraidon is a large, {{wp|reptile|reptilian}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} primarily covered in scarlet feathers with white accents on its cheeks, upper body, thighs, and tail. Its most notable feature is a tire-like {{wp|Gular skin|gular sac}} on its throat, which inflates and deflates depending on its form. Koraidon's head has a {{wp|Crest (feathers)|crest}} of feathers and a pair of long, twisted, brow-plume-like tendrils. Additional feathers at the base of its tail transition from blue to purple and end in white tips, creating a striking appearance. Its eyes have yellow sclerae, orange irises, and brown pupils, with red plumes giving the impression of eyebrows. Koraidon's body is adorned with blue markings on its elbows and shoulders, as well as blue frills down its neck. From each shoulder, a curved, handlebar-like structure extends backward. It has webbed feet, each with four claws; the two central claws are sometimes held close together, making it appear as though there are only three. The gular sac and base of its tail share a grooved texture, but the sac is also lined with spikes.

Aware of its formidable strength, Koraidon exudes confidence and rarely feels threatened. Though cautious around [[human]]s, its curiosity sometimes leads it to play with them. Its power surges under [[harsh sunlight]] due to an {{a|Orichalcum Pulse|ancient energy}} coursing through its body. In battle, Koraidon will {{m|Collision Course|unfurl its wings and crash into}} its targets with explosive force. While Koraidon bears a resemblance to modern-day {{p|Cyclizar}}, it is known to be far more ferocious and muscular. 

The origins of Koraidon in the present day trace back to a [[time machine]] constructed by [[Professor Sada]], which brought two specimens to [[Area Zero]] a decade ago. These two individuals displayed contrasting temperaments: {{ga|Koraidon|one}} was friendly and curious, while the [[Area Zero#Area Zero Depths|other]] was aggressive and territorial. 200 years prior to the events of Scarlet and Violet, [[Heath]] also encountered a Koraidon, as seen in the [[Scarlet Book]], though it is unclear how it arrived in Area Zero at the time. According to [[AI Sada]], it is an ancient Pokémon related to {{p|Cyclizar}}. However, a version of Professor Sada that appeared at the [[Crystal Pool]] suggests that Koraidon is a counterpart to Cyclizar from an alternate timeline.  It was formerly referred to as the "Winged King" in the Scarlet Book, with its current name coined by Professor Sada, potentially as a result of a {{wp|bootstrap paradox}}.

Koraidon has five different {{form|Form-like transformations|transformations}} it can change between as it traverses varying terrain and adapts to different situations. In its "Apex Build", Koraidon shifts to a bipedal stance and adopts a poised, battle-ready posture. The feathers on its head and rear unfold and stand upright, forming a crest that resembles a {{wp|war bonnet}}. The gular sac on its throat inflates, displaying a red, gear-like pattern, while the base of its tail becomes more robust. Koraidon's claws spread apart, revealing the white membranes between its toes. During battle, Koraidon leverages its immense strength and array of natural weapons to overpower opponents, including powerful jaws, sharp claws, and a sturdy tail. Its legs possess extraordinary strength, allowing it to leap over 65 feet into the air and use the momentum from its falls for devastating kicks and body slams.<ref>[https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon/koraidon/ Koraidon — Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet | Official Website]</ref> It is said to have the power to shatter the ground with its fists alone. According to [[Arven]], this is Koraidon's true form. In its "Limited Build", Koraidon reverts to a quadrupedal stance. The feathers on its head and rear are folded and closed, and the gular sac retracts, exposing a tire-like protrusion. The webbing between its claws is not visible, as its central claws stay close together. Koraidon typically takes on this form when weakened or not engaged in battle. In all travel forms, Koraidon's tail stays tucked in, displaying a pattern similar to that found on its gular sac. In its "Sprinting Build", Koraidon tucks its tail and runs on all fours, allowing it to reach high speeds and climb steep cliffs. In its "Swimming Build", the gular sac inflates, enabling Koraidon to float on water. It propels itself by paddling with its webbed feet. In its "Gliding Build", the tendrils on Koraidon's head unfurl into wings, allowing it to glide or even fly through the sky.<ref name=SVsite>[https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/news/legendary_pokemon/ Legendary Pokémon — Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet | Official Website]</ref><ref>[https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/news/flying/ Unlock the Power to Fly with Koraidon or Miraidon! - Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet | Official Website]</ref>

Koraidon is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Collision Course}}. It is also the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Orichalcum Pulse}} as an [[Ability]].

==Trivia==
* Koraidon and {{p|Miraidon}} are the only [[Paradox Pokémon]]:
** Whose names follow regular Pokémon naming conventions.
*** To not have different names between languages.
** To each have their own unique Abilities.
* Of all Pokémon, Koraidon and Miraidon have the highest number of forms that are obtainable in some capacity yet unusable in battle, as they each use three forms solely for travel and are obtained in their fourth 'low-power' forms, yet can only battle in their 'high-power' forms.
** Curiously, the forms are fully usable in battle when hacked into the game, albeit with various glitches and oddities.<ref>[https://tcrf.net/Pok%C3%A9mon_Scarlet_and_Violet#Dex_Entries Miraidon & Koraidon's Ride forms on The Cutting Room Floor]</ref>
*** In its unused Pokédex entry, non-Apex Build Koraidon is 11'6" / 3.5m tall, the same height as Ultimate Mode {{p|Miraidon}}, and taller than Apex Build Koraidon.
** {{p|Rotom}} has five forms that are unusable in battle ([[Rotom Pokédex|Pokédex]], [[Rotom Phone|Phone]], [[Rotom Bike|Bike]], [[Rotomi]], [[Drone Rotom|Drone]]), but Rotomi and Drone Rotom are completely unobtainable.
* The builds of Koraidon in Japanese and Korean use {{wp|Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese}} and {{wp|Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean}} words respectively, showing tradition and the past, while the modes of {{p|Miraidon}} in the same languages use borrowed words from English, showing modernity.
* Despite being able to swim and fly with the player on its back, Koraidon cannot learn {{m|Surf}} or {{m|Fly}}. It shares this trait with its counterpart {{p|Miraidon}}.
* Koraidon is the subject of the [[Honda Koraidon Project]], which sought to recreate the Pokémon as a mobile model.

===Origin===
Koraidon may be based on an amalgamation of various lizards, dinosaurs, and vague depictions of European fantasy dragons. It notably resembles the {{wp|Dactyloidae|anole}} and the genera ''{{wp|Sitana}}'' and ''{{wp|Sarada (lizard)|Sarada}}''—the latter two are collectively known as fan-throated lizards. It also has traits from other lizard species, namely the frills of the {{wp|iguana}}, the feet of the {{wp|gecko}}, and the prehensile tail of the {{wp|chameleon}}. It also bears some resemblance to the basilisk, a creature from medieval European mythology particularly popular in the Iberian Peninsula. 

Koraidon's feathers may be a reference to {{wp|feathered dinosaur}}s, while its bipedal stance in its Apex Build is reminiscent of older depictions of {{wp|theropod}} dinosaurs. Furthermore, its signature move of {{m|Collision Course}} alludes to the asteroid that caused the {{wp|Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event}}, which eliminated most dinosaur species on Earth. Its head shape, its posture in its Apex Build and its alternate name, "Winged King", may be a reference to the ''{{wp|Tyrannosaurus}}'', colloquially known as the "King of the Dinosaurs" due to its {{wp|type species}}, ''T. rex'', being named with the Latin word for "king": the word ''Tyrannosaurus'' itself is Greek for "King Lizard." As they're displayed mostly on the head and in the waist area, the colorful feathers might be reference to ancient cultures in general, as opposed to Miraidon's futuristic look. Ancient civilizations (notably Central and South American) and tribes often used bird feathers as ornaments and symbol of status. Koraidon's twisted tendrils also resemble the brow-plumes on the {{wp|King of Saxony bird-of-paradise}}. 

Some elements of Koraidon's design may be based on parts of off-road motorcycles (such as {{wp|chopper (motorcycle)|choppers}} or dirt bikes built for off-road or natural terrains). This is shown by its brow plumes and shoulders which are similar to handlebars (especially longer ones known as "ape hangers"), and the protrusion on its chest together with its tail resemble rubber tires, the latter especially when curled. Koraidon may have conceptually been influenced by {{wp|cave paintings}}, as indicated by the ancient past motifs as well as its red color scheme; the oldest known cave painting is a red hand stencil found in the {{wp|caves of Maltravieso}} in Spain, one of the inspirations of the Paldea region.

Additionally, due to its color scheme, its status as a [[Paradox Pokémon]], and it being the mascot of [[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet|Pokémon Scarlet]], it could be based on infared, a color that exists beyond the human visible light spectrum. It can't be seen, but it's still there, much like the confusing and contradictory origins of the Paradox Pokémon. Building on to this, it could be based on the concept of {{wp|Redshift|redshifting}}, which is the phenomenon of things that move away from the observer (i.e things that have already gone by, in the past) appear reddish in color, which would make Koraidon a redshifted version of the green Cyclizar.

====Name origin====
Koraidon may be a combination of 古来 ''korai'' or 古代 ''kodai'' (ancient), ライド ''raido'' (ride), and ''dragon'', ''don'' (Spanish for lord), or ''-don'' (common suffix in dinosaur names derived from the Ancient Greek word for tooth).

Its alternate name, Winged King, is literally ''winged king''.

Tsubasano'ou, its alternate name in Japanese, can be taken literally as 翼の王 ''tsubasa no ō'' (winged king).

In the [[Area Zero journals]], [[Professor Sada]] mentions having named Koraidon. Due to a {{wp|bootstrap paradox}} involving a version of Professor Sada [[time travel]]ing from the past, it is possible that the player in [[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet|Pokémon Scarlet]] may be responsible for indirectly coining Koraidon's name.
