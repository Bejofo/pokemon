'''Magneton''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''レアコイル''' ''Rarecoil'') is a dual-type {{2t|Electric|Steel}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]]. Prior to [[Generation II]], it [[:Category:Pokémon that have had their type changed|was]] a pure {{type|Electric}} Pokémon.

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Magnemite}} starting at [[level]] 30 and evolves into {{p|Magnezone}} when [[level]]ed up in a [[special magnetic field]] or when exposed to a [[Thunder Stone]].

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for these details.)

The [[Paradox Pokémon]] {{p|Sandy Shocks}} is said to be an ancient relative of Magneton or a counterpart of it from a parallel timeline.

==Biology==
[[File:Clemont Magneton three Magnemite.png|thumb|250px|left|Magneton splitting into three Magnemite]]
Magneton is a robot-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}, the result of three {{p|Magnemite}} becoming linked together by a strong magnetic force, although a single Magnemite can evolve by itself when there are no other Magnemite in the vicinity. Each individual Magnemite has a gray spherical body with a single eye, and a gray and red-and-blue tipped horseshoe magnet on each side. The topmost Magnemite has three {{wp|Phillips head}} screws on its body, while the others appear to have only two. The three Magnemite that Magneton consists of can be linked in several ways. Magneton is most commonly seen as one Magnemite on top, and two Magnemite linked by the screws on the bottom, forming a triangle. In some cases, commonly seen in 3D games such as {{g|Snap}}, the Magnemite will not be connected at all, remain in a triangular formation at rest, and are able to freely move within each other's vicinity to form other patterns. In this case, all three Magnemite have three screws. The magnetic forces that hold the three Magnemite together are powerful enough to dry up all moisture and raise the temperature by 3.6&nbsp;°F (2&nbsp;°C) within a radius of 3,300 feet (one kilometer). It can also be disruptive to electronic devices and induce earaches. It uses powerful radio waves to help it study the surrounding area.

Magneton's anti-gravitational powers enable it to fly through the air. Being composed of three Magnemite, it is about three times as powerful electrically, though not three times as intelligent. Even though Magneton is a mechanical creature, it still needs to eat. As seen in the ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' episode ''[[EP195|The Poké Spokesman]]'', food for Magneton consists of electrical currents. It is usually found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Rough-terrain Pokémon|rough terrain}}, often near [[power plant]]s. 

When sunspots flare up, Magneton tends to appear more often, presumably due to the changes in the sun's magnetic field. When rain clouds form, it also gathers in high areas prone to lightning strikes. As seen in [[PS011|the eleventh chapter of Pokémon Adventures]], it possesses the ability to form its electricity into both platforms and barriers. As seen in the {{aniseries|HZ}} episode ''[[HZ012|The Future I Choose]]'', it can cause interference with phone and internet signals. In ''[[HZ013|An Unexpected Picnic!]]'', a herd of Magneton produced an EMP that could destroy computer software. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, carvings depicting Magneton have been [[Media:Neo Premium File 2.jpg|discovered]] at the [[Ruins of Alph]]. One was shown in the [[Pokémon Generations]] episode ''[[PG18|The Redemption]]'' in a flashback to the great war of [[Kalos]], indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years. Additionally, {{p|Sandy Shocks}} bears a strong resemblance to Magneton. It is believed to be an ancient Magneton that was alive 10,000 years ago. As mentioned in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Magneton is known to sleep with its three linked Magnemite either stuck together or drifting apart by a strong magnetic force.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref> It is theoried that its magnetism is unstable while Magneton sleeps.

===Evolution===
Magneton evolves from {{p|Magnemite}} and evolves into {{p|Magnezone}}.

===Evolution data===
Magneton [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Magnemite}} starting at [[level]] 30 and, since [[Generation IV]], evolves into {{p|Magnezone}} when [[level]]ed up in a [[special magnetic field]]. Magneton cannot evolve into Magnezone in {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}}, due to there being no area in [[Kanto]] or [[Johto]] with a special magnetic field. Magneton also cannot evolve in {{LGPE}}, as Magnezone is not present in those games. There is also no special magnetic field in {{g|Sword and Shield}} or {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, so from [[Generation VIII]] onwards, Magneton is also able to evolve into Magnezone when exposed to a [[Thunder Stone]].

====Major appearances====
=====[[Clemont's Magneton]]=====
{{an|Clemont}} owns a Magneton, which he keeps at the [[Lumiose Gym]] so [[Clembot]] can use it for Gym Battles while Clemont is away. It first appeared in ''[[XY009|Clemont's Got a Secret!]]'', where it was revealed to be able to separate itself into three Magnemite in order to dodge attacks.

==Trivia==
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Magneton was originally known as "Recoil".
* Magneton and its pre-evolved form were the first {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} to ever change [[type]]s with the progress of [[generation]]s.
* Although it is said that Magneton is made up of three Magnemite, there is contradictory evidence seen in various forms of media.
** In the only animated episode to date showing a Magnemite Evolution, ''[[EP101|Get Along, Little Pokémon]]'', when {{OBP|Ethan|EP101}}'s Magnemite #6 evolves into Magneton, it "creates" two Magnemite during Evolution, instead of combining with two real Magnemite. Similarly, in the main series games, when Magnemite reaches level 30, it evolves without the aid of two additional Magnemite. This is unlike {{p|Mantyke}}, which requires a {{p|Remoraid}} to evolve.
** In {{g|Snap}}, a Magneton is clearly shown to be created by three Magnemite. Also, when two Magnemite get stuck together halfway through Evolution in {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team}}, they mention how three Magnemite must come together to evolve.
** After Evolution, Magneton becomes exactly ten times heavier than Magnemite. Logically, it should be three times heavier due to it being three Magnemite (39.6&nbsp;lbs). Magnemite weighs 13.2&nbsp;lbs. (6.0&nbsp;kg), whereas Magneton weighs 132.3&nbsp;lbs. (60.0&nbsp;kg). This could be related to early art which depicts Magneton as having larger spheres.
* Magneton is usually depicted with only seven screws, with two of the Magnemite losing one screw each upon Evolution. However, it is occasionally depicted with 9 screws such as in its [[Generation II]] and [[Generation III]] sprites.  
* The 3 Magnemite composing Magneton are usually depicted as attached to each other and only occasionally separating. However, in certain games such as {{g|Stadium}} and {{g|Colosseum}}, the Magnemite are depicted as floating separately from each other and only occasionally combining to attack.   
* Magneton and Magnemite are two of few Pokémon that had their [[cry]] changed slightly in [[Generation III]]. This was due to Generation III utilizing a better sound effects game engine and [[Game Boy Advance|newer game system]].
* Despite most depictions of Magneton showing they are able to float through the air, Magneton does not have the Ability {{a|Levitate}}, so it is still affected by {{type|Ground}} moves. However, starting in [[Generation IV]], Magneton can learn {{m|Magnet Rise}}, which simulates Levitate for five turns.
* Magneton is the only {{type|Electric}} {{DL|List of Pokémon by shape|Pokémon consisting of multiple bodies}}.
* Magneton is the Pokémon with the most cosmopolitan distribution. It was available in at least one version of every regional Pokédex until Kitakami. This includes the Orre region and the ''Pokémon Ranger'' series regional browsers.
* Magneton is the only Pokémon to share its weight with any of its {{pkmn2|Paradox}} relative species, weighing the same as {{p|Sandy Shocks}}.
** It is also the only Pokémon with an ancient relative that is not heavier than its present-day relative. 

===Origin===
Magneton is a cluster of three Magnemite, which in turn seems to be based on the objectification of {{wp|electromagnetism}}, one of the four {{wp|fundamental interactions}} of nature. They are likely linked through strong electromagnetic force.

====Name origin====
Magneton may be a combination of ''magnet'' and ''ton''. It may also be derived from ''{{wp|magneton}}'' (various units of magnetic moment) or possibly ''{{wp|Cavity magnetron|magnetron}}'' (high-power vacuum tube).

Rarecoil may be a combination of ''{{wp|rare-earth magnet}}'' and ''{{wp|electromagnetic coil}}''.
