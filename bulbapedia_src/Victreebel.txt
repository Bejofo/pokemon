'''Victreebel''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ウツボット''' ''Utsubot'') is a dual-type {{2t|Grass|Poison}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Weepinbell}} when exposed to a [[Leaf Stone]]. It is the final form of {{p|Bellsprout}}.

Victreebel will be able to [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Victreebel''' in the upcoming game {{g|Legends: Z-A}}.

==Biology==
Victreebel is a {{wp|pitcher plant}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a bell-shaped body. It has a gaping mouth with a swollen pink lip and two sharp teeth on the bottom. Its semicircular eyes appear directly under its mouth and it has several dark green spots on its body. On either side of its body is a large green leaf. Covering Victreebel's mouth is a leaf with a long, brown, yellow-tipped vine growing out of it.

Victreebel is said to live in huge colonies deep in jungles, although no one has ever returned from there. Being the result of exposure to an [[Evolution stone]], Victreebel is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Forest Pokémon|temperate forests and jungles}}. The vine on its leaf is flicked to mimic an animal in order to attract prey. It also produces a sweet scent of nectar or honey to further aid in luring its victims. Acid that has dissolved numerous prey becomes sweeter and even more effective at attracting prey. In the Pokémon Adventures chapter ''[[PS022|A Hollow Victreebel]]'', Victreebel hoards food, usually small birds and rodents, and collects [[Leaf Stone]]s to perform [[Evolution]] rituals at night to help {{p|Weepinbell}} become Victreebel as well. As mentioned in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Victreebel is known to sleep with its mouth open to draw in prey.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref> Very rarely however, it forgets about luring in prey and instead chooses to sleep face down.

===Forms===
[[File:Mega Victreebel Sludge Bomb.png|thumb|left|250px|Mega Victreebel opening its mouth when using {{m|Sludge Bomb}}<ref name=ZAsite2/>]]
Victreebel can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Victreebel.

Mega Victreebel's body is massive compared to regular Victreebel, standing at almost three times its height and weighing over eight times as much. Its most distinctive feature is its bloated body, which is filled with large amounts of acid that Mega Victreebel creates thanks to the energy of Mega Evolution. The amount of acid in Mega Victreebel's body is so large that even closing its mouth is not enough to contain it,<ref name=ZAsite2/> so it has to wrap its throat with its own elongated vine in order to prevent the acid from spilling out.<ref name=ZAsite/> Other notable physical features of Mega Victreebel include green leaves with orange tips on the sides of its body, and three large leaves on the tip of its vine hovering over its head, which also have orange tips.

Due to the overflowing acid inside Mega Victreebel's body, it no longer catches prey by sitting still with its mouth open. Instead, it aggressively chases down prey by hopping about, landing destructive tackles with its body. The matured acid has a dizzying sweet scent, which Mega Victreebel uses to immobilize opponents by fanning the fumes towards them with the leaves on top of its head. The acid is also powerful enough to melt concrete or steel.<ref name=ZAsite>[https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/story-world/pokemon/mega-victreebel Pokémon Legends: Z-A | Mega Victreebel] — Pokémon Official Website</ref> When Mega Victreebel opens its mouth to unleash its acid, its deflated appearance briefly resembles Victreebel's normal form.<ref name=ZAsite2>(August 21, 2025).

{{main|Victreebel (TCG)}}

==Trivia==
* In [[Generation I]], Victreebel has the highest [[index number]] of all non-[[glitch Pokémon]].
* Despite learning {{m|Leech Life}} through {{pkmn|breeding}}, Victreebel and its pre-evolved forms could not learn it through [[TM]] until {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}.
* In {{aniseries|HZ}}, [[Brassius]] has made a pitcher modeled after a Victreebel. This could be a pun because it is based off of a pitcher plant.
* Mega Victreebel was first teased in a short video titled "The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident", which was released on August 21, 2025.<ref>(August 21, 2025). "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyfDz36JkkU The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident | Pokémon Legends: Z-A]." The Official Pokémon YouTube channel. ''[[YouTube]]''.</ref>

===Concept and development===
Victreebel, along with its evolutionary relatives, was designed by [[Atsuko Nishida]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19980121112202fw_/http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/POKEMON/INTER/ATSUKO/INTER_AT.HTM Interview with Atsuko Nishida on Game Freak's website] (archived, Japanese)</ref><ref>[https://funs-project.com/poplab/007/index_2.html Fun's Project interview with Atsuko Nishida] (Japanese)</ref>

===Origin===
{{bulbanews|On the Origin of Species: Victreebel}}
Victreebel may be based on carnivorous {{wp|pitcher plant}}s. The blue lips in its {{Shiny}} coloration may reference how a pitcher plant's rim turns blue under {{wp|Ultraviolet|UV light}}.

Mega Victreebel may be based on the ''{{wp|Nepenthes}}'' genus in particular — specifically their lower traps that tend to be larger and sit on the ground. The way Mega Victreebel's vine constricts its mouth shut may also be inspired by the coiling vines of several ''Nepenthes'' species such as ''{{wp|Nepenthes mirabilis}}''. Mega Victreebel also bears resemblance to {{wp|calabash}}es (also known as "bottle gourds"), {{wp|waterskin}}s, or {{wp|wineskin}}s. It may also be based on {{wp|Water balloon#Yo-yo balloon|water balloon yo-yos}} (Japanese: 水ヨーヨー ''mizu yo-yo'') used in the game of yo-yo fishing (Japanese: ヨーヨー釣り ''yo-yo tsuri'').

====Name origin====
Victreebel may be a combination of ''victory'', ''tree'', and ''bell''. The shortening of "bell" into ''bel'' is likely a result of the ten-character limit on English Pokémon names in [[Generation I]].

Utsubot may be derived from 靫葛 ''utsubokazura'' (pitcher plant) and possibly ポット ''pot''.
