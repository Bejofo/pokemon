'''Palafin''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''イルカマン''' ''Irukaman'') is a {{type|Water}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation IX]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Finizen}} when [[level]]ed up while connected with another player via the [[Union Circle]] starting at level 38.

Palafin [[#Form data|transforms]] into its '''Hero Form''' when it is [[Recall|switched out]] from battle.

(Refer to [[#Form data|Game data&rarr;Form data]] for more details.)

==Biology==
Zero Form Palafin is an {{wp|cetacean}} Pokémon that resembles a {{wp|dolphin}}. Its body is mainly light blue. Its underbelly and the underside of its fins are colored in a paler shade of light blue, which extends further to its lower jaw and around its eyes. The tip of its dorsal fin and the wave patterns on the sides of its body are white. It has eyes with two-tone blue and pink irises, a short snout, a pair of flippers, a blowhole atop its head, and a split tailfin with a single water ring surrounding the peduncle. Overall, it is almost identical to {{p|Finizen}}, its pre-evolved form, except for one single detail: a light pink heart-shaped mark on its chest, outlined by a slightly larger white one.  

In its Zero Form, Palafin is said to be equal to Finizen in terms of physical capabilities. Like Finizen as well, it can also sense the emotions and even the thoughts of others through ultrasonic waves.

Palafin is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Jet Punch}}. It is also the [[signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Zero to Hero}} as an [[Ability]].

===Forms===
Palafin has two forms: Zero Form and Hero Form.

;Hero Form
When Palafin hears its [[party|allies]] calling for help, it'll {{a|Zero to Hero|change its appearance and power itself up}}, awakening its ancient genes, thus transforming into its Hero Form. Its moment of transformation will only be shown to those it trusts.
[[File:Palafin flotation device.png|thumb|left|250px|A flotation device created out of Hero Form Palafin's water rings]]
Hero Form Palafin's appearance is drastically different, having given up its previous sleek, streamlined body in favor of a much more bulky and human-like physique. It is now able to stand on the flukes of its tail fin, which are longer and more slender than those of its Zero Form. Its body is now primarily indigo, although some parts, such as its sides, lower jaw, and the bottom of its flukes are colored in a pale shade of light blue. Its dorsal fin now has a white stripe in addition to the white tip. The heart-shaped mark on its chest has expanded into a shape that somewhat resembles a shield, now occupying most of its chest and abdomen. Notably, the central heart has deepened in color, going from light pink to dark pink, and also resembles the shape of a cetacean's tail flukes. As a result of its transformation, its eyes, the tip of its flippers, and shoulders have been covered by a set of lenses, gloves, and cape, respectively. There are now three water rings around its peduncle.
[[File:Hero Form Palafin chest.png|thumb|250px|Hero Form Palafin's chest glowing]]
Once it changes into its Hero Form, Palafin reaches its full power, being strong enough to lift a cruise ship with just one fin and swim at speeds of 50 knots. It is known to save drowning people and Pokémon. As seen in ''[[HZ042|Transform! Hero of the Seas, Palafin]]'', Hero Form Palafin is able of stretching and contracting its water rings at will, as well as shooting them off its body. This can be done to create a flotation device to save drowning people. By releasing water from its blowhole, it can propel itself to jump very high and fly through the air. Despite the shape of its gloves, Hero Form Palafin does not gain hands upon changing into this form; instead, the tip of its flippers now have three small holes, from which it appears to expel the water needed to form its seafoam gloves and {{m|Jet Punch|fire them off like jets of water}}. It has enhanced vision due to the waterproof lenses that cover its eyes. The dark pink symbol on its chest glows pink as Hero Form Palafin takes on the people's cheers. That same episode also revealed that its chest is its weak point. According to [[Professor Friede's Pokémon Seminar]], the sense of justice on Palafin's heart is its biggest source of strength. In this form, it is known as the "Pelagic Protector"<ref>Upon interacting with the poster on [[Penny]]'s dorm room: "''There's a poster of Palafin, the Pelagic Protector!''" ({{g|Scarlet and Violet}})</ref> and the "Hero of the Ocean".<ref>''[[HZ042|Transform! Hero of the Seas, Palafin]]''</ref>

===Evolution===
Palafin evolves from {{p|Finizen}}.

===Form data===
Palafin has two interchangeable forms: Zero Form and Hero Form. It will always be in Zero Form outside of {{pkmn|battle}}.

Palafin starts battles in its Zero Form. When it is [[Recall|switched out]] without [[Fainted|fainting]], it changes into Hero Form with its [[Ability]] {{a|Zero to Hero}}, and remains in that form until the battle ends.

|loc2=After switching out
}}

The two forms have different [[base stats]], with Hero Form having increased {{stat|Attack}}, {{stat|Defense}}, {{stat|Special Attack}}, and {{stat|Special Defense}} but identical {{stat|HP}} and {{stat|Speed}} compared to Zero Form. It also has different [[cry|cries]] depending on its form. In particular, Zero Form Palafin and its pre-Evolution, {{p|Finizen}}, have identical cries.

Both forms of Palafin debuted in ''[[HZ042|Transform! Hero of the Seas, Palafin]]''.

Only [[Liko]], however, was able to see the {{a|Zero to Hero|actual transformation process}}, as a token of gratitude for preventing the [[Snap Boys]] from photographing its transformation, but she chose to not tell anyone of what she saw.

==Trivia==
* Zero Form Palafin is the [[List of Pokémon with unique base stat totals|only Pokémon]] with a base stat total of 457.
* Hero Form Palafin:
** is the only Pokémon with a base stat total of 650.
** has the highest base {{stat|Attack}} stat of all {{type|Water}} Pokémon.

===Origin===
Palafin seems to be based on a {{wp|dolphin}} and a {{wp|superhero}}. Its Zero Form's relative lack of visual changes from its pre-Evolution seems to be inspired by the trope of superheroes assuming civilian identities to keep their true identity a secret, while its Hero Form seems to represent the hero suiting up whilst unseen and emerging as a superhero. The names of its forms and Ability reference the term "[[wiktionary:go from zero to hero|go from zero to hero]]". The connection between dolphins and superheroes may be inspired by numerous accounts of wild dolphins saving people in open seas.

Additionally, Palafin may be based on the {{wp|Boto#Folklore|Pink Boto}}, a mythical South American creature that takes the form of an ordinary pink river dolphin but can occasionally take a human form and will join in human festivities. Eventually, the Boto must return to the water and shapeshift back into an ordinary pink dolphin. Hero Form Palafin may also draw inspirations from the ''{{wp|Ultraman}}'' series. Its heart-shaped symbol glows and emits a beeping sound when it is weak, much like the various iterations of Ultraman. Hero Form Palafin's {{Shiny}} coloration is reminiscent of the {{wp|Chilean dolphin}}, also known as the black dolphin.

Palafin evolving from Finizen at level 38 may be a reference to 1938, the year {{wp|Superman}} debuted.<!--please discuss on the talk page before attempting to remove this line-->

====Name origin====
Palafin may be a combination of ''{{wp|paladin}}'' or ''pal'' (since another player is needed to evolve it) and ''fin'' or ''delfín'' (Spanish for dolphin).

Irukaman may be a combination of 海豚 ''iruka'' (dolphin) and ''man'', which is often used as a suffix for superhero codenames.
