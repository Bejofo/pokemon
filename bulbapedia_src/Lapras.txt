'''Lapras''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ラプラス''' ''Laplace'') is a dual-type {{2t|Water|Ice}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Lapras can [[Gigantamax]] into '''Gigantamax Lapras''' if it has the {{DL|Gigantamax|Gigantamax Factor}}.

==Biology==
[[File:Lapras aging.png|thumb|left|250px|Comparison between Lapras's younger and older appearances]]
Lapras is a {{wp|marine reptile|marine reptilian}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that resembles a {{wp|plesiosaur}}. It has a blue hide with darker blue spots and a cream-colored underside. It has large brown eyes, a short horn on its forehead, and tightly curled ears. It has a long neck and four flippers. The foremost flippers are larger than the hind. On its back is a heavy, gray shell covered in blunt knobs.

Lapras is a gentle, helpful Pokémon that enjoys ferrying people across bodies of water. In the past, its docility made it an easy target for hunters, and it was driven to near extinction. Recent protection efforts have seen Lapras become overabundant instead, which is now affecting the fish Pokémon numbers in some areas. An intelligent Pokémon, it can understand human speech. As seen in the {{aniseries|PTS}} episode ''[[EP113|Viva Las Lapras]]'', Lapras has been known to travel in large pods across {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Sea Pokémon|the seas}}, spanning both polar and tropical areas. To keep in touch with others of its kind, it sings enchanting melodies. Lapras usually sing when it is in a good mood. In the episode ''[[Holiday Hi-Jynx|Holiday Hi-Jynx]]'', it's shown that Lapras can develop psychic abilities such as telepathy. In [[Alola]], Lapras is used as a [[Poké Ride|Ride Pokémon]] called Lapras Paddle, Alolan natives use Lapras to travel and [[Fishing|fish]] for Pokémon in the water.

===Forms===
Lapras has a [[Gigantamax]] form.

As Gigantamax Lapras, it becomes larger in size and more armored. Its shell resembles a cruise ship or ocarina with four gray and red stripes surrounding it, and it has four spikes on top of its shell with one steel spike resembling a funnel, which has three red clouds surrounding it. The sclera in Lapras' eyes change colors to white, yellow, and blue. A light blue ring of fine thin lines resembling a musical sheet created from ice particles circles around its shell.

5,000 people can ride on the shell of Gigantamax Lapras for a very comfortable ride without any issues. Lapras can use its giant ring to break any icebergs that may prevent it from swimming. According to [[Oleana]], Gigantamax Lapras's shell is not part of its body, as the shell has a logarithmic spiral structure.<ref>''[[TW05|Assistant]]'' — [[Pokémon: Twilight Wings]]</ref>

Gigantamax Lapras is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of using the [[G-Max Move]] {{m|G-Max Resonance}}.

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
* {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}} and [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of the Sky|Explorers of Sky]]: Lapras is the Pokémon that ferries Pokémon to the [[Hidden Land]]. When {{mdc|Wigglytuff|2}} explored the [[Brine Cave]] and found the strange marking on the wall there, Lapras asked Wigglytuff not to investigate it further to keep the Hidden Land a secret. During the player's exploration of Brine Cave, the partner's Relic Fragment resonates with a painting in the deepest part of the cave, and this summons Lapras. Lapras ferries the player, the partner, and Grovyle to the Hidden Land, along the way telling the story of what happened when Wigglytuff and {{mdc|Chatot|2}} came to Brine Cave. Later, after the player defeats Dialga at Temporal Tower, Lapras will be waiting at the beach and can ferry the player and the partner back to the Hidden Land again. There is no limit to how many times Lapras can do this.
* {{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}}: Lapras runs the [[Lapras Travel Liner]], which allows the player to visit other continents in the [[Pokémon world (Mystery Dungeon)|world]]. After the completion of the main story arc, Lapras will be recruitable after the player has established 100 connections.

==In animation==
===Main series===
[[File:Lapras anime.png|thumb|250px|Lapras in ''[[Pokémon Journeys: The Series]]'']]
====Major appearances====
=====[[Ash's Lapras]]=====
Lapras made its physical animated series debut in ''[[EP084|The Lost Lapras]]'', where {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} saved a young one from [[Three punks|a trio of thugs]], and then again from {{TRT}}. Ash {{pkmn2|caught}} this Lapras and mostly used it as transportation between the [[Orange Islands]]. It was returned to its family in ''[[EP113|Viva Las Lapras]]''. Ash's Lapras became the leader of the herd in their appearance in ''[[EP257|Lapras of Luxury]]''.

=====[[Lapras herd]]=====
[[File:Lapras herd.png|thumb|220px|left|The [[Lapras herd]] in ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'']]
In ''[[EP113|Viva Las Lapras]]'', Ash and his friends located Lapras's school off the coast of [[Tarroco Island]]. However, the group wanted nothing to do with Ash's Lapras and they swam away. Later, Ash's group rescued the school from [[Captain Crook]] and his crew of [[Pokémon hunter|Pokémon poachers]], and Ash's Lapras subsequently returned to the herd.

In ''[[EP257|Lapras of Luxury]]'', Ash and his friends met [[Naomi]], a marine biologist and Lapras expert, near [[New Bark Town]]. They also re-encountered Ash's Lapras and its herd as they continued their annual migration from the [[Orange Islands]] to the [[Johto]] [[region]]. Ash's Lapras became the leader of the herd after it defeated {{TRT}}, who were attempting to snatch the group. The Lapras herd later left to continue their migration.
=====[[Lucius's Lapras]]=====
[[File:Lucius Lapras.png|thumb|250px|A heavily scarred {{tp|Lucius|Lapras}} in ''[[Pokémon Horizons: The Series]]'']]
A Lapras appeared in a fantasy in ''[[HZ025|Rivals in the Dark of Night!]]'', where it was revealed she was one of [[Lucius]]'s Pokémon and one of the [[Six Heroes]]. She made her first physical appearance in ''[[HZ031|Song Within the Mist]]'' as the leader of a group of [[wild Pokémon]] that robbed ships of food while pretending to lead them out of fog. In [[HZ032|the next episode]], she reentered her [[Ancient Poké Ball]], choosing to be taken under [[Liko]]'s care.

=====[[Lapras (Explorers of Time, Darkness, and Sky)]]=====
A Lapras took [[Team Poképals]] across the Sea of Time in ''[[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky - Beyond Time & Darkness]]''.

=====Other=====
Lapras made its physical TV debut in ''[[Holiday Hi-Jynx]]'' under ownership of [[Santa Claus]], where it helped Ash and his friends reunite a {{p|Jynx}} with [[Santa Claus]]. This Lapras was able to [[talking Pokémon|talk]] via telepathy.

In ''[[PK09|Snorlax Snowman]]'', two Lapras saved {{AP|Pikachu}} and his friends after their ice boat fell apart.

In ''[[HS15|Putting the Air Back in Aerodactyl!]]'', three Lapras appeared whenever {{OBP|Crystal|HS15}} whistles.

In ''[[AG180|May, We Harley Drew'd Ya!]]'', [[Solidad]] used a Lapras during the [[Appeal|Performance Stage]] of the [[Kanto Grand Festival]]. It was later used in a [[Double Battle|two-on-two]] [[Contest Battle]] along with {{p|Butterfree}}.

Three Lapras appeared in ''[[XY049|Bonnie for the Defense!]]'', including a young Lapras who was being taken care of by [[Heidi]], [[Kye]], and [[Jay]].

The most notable role of Lapras in [[Pokémon Adventures]] was being one of the Pokémon of [[Pryce]]. In his youth, Pryce lost two of his favorite Lapras, La Pris and La Prus, in an avalanche just as the {{pkmn|Egg}} borne by them hatched. Unable to get over his loss, Pryce swore to save his Lapras and thus began researching into [[time travel]], setting the events of the [[Johto]] saga in motion. Eventually, Pryce was able to capture {{adv|Celebi}} and enter time, only to lose Celebi as the [[GS Ball]] containing it was shattered, causing him to be unable to override time any further. However, the baby Lapras, La Glace, was able to enter the time in which Pryce's Lapras were separated, and the family enjoyed a happy reunion while Pryce was eventually lost in time. The child Lapras first appeared in ''[[PS143|Irked Igglybuff and Curmudgeonly Cleffa]]'' and the parents appeared in ''[[PS180|The Last Battle XIV]]''.

==In the TFG==
One Lapras figure has been released.
* {{TFG|Groundbreakers}}: {{TFG ID|Groundbreakers|Lapras|15}}

==Trivia==
[[File:Photo Spot Azure Bay.png|thumb|200px|Riding on Lapras in [[Azure Bay]]]]
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Lapras was originally going to be called "Ness", a reference to the {{wp|Loch Ness Monster}}.
* Lapras is one of two {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} to use telepathy to speak to humans in a regular episode of the {{pkmn|animated series}}. The other is {{p|Ralts}}.
* In [[Generation II]] games, a Lapras icon represents Lapras, {{p|Seel}}, or {{p|Dewgong}} at the [[party]] screen.
* In Generation II games, when any Pokémon except {{p|Pikachu}} uses {{m|Surf}} to travel over [[water tile|bodies of water]], the player appears to be controlling a Lapras. This surfing Lapras shares the same color palette as the player, therefore it is red if the player is {{ga|Ethan|male}} ([[File:GSC Surf M.png]]) or blue if the player is {{ga|Kris|female}} ([[File:C Surf F.png]]).
* In [[Pokémon X and Y]], Lapras has a unique 3D model when {{m|surf}}ing, whereas all other surfing Pokémon are depicted as dark blobs. This may be an homage to the [[Generation II]] surfing sprites, or Lapras's role as a means of transport.
** A Shiny Lapras uses the same 3D model as a regular one while surfing.
** In [[Photography#Pokémon X and Y|photos]] taken at [[Azure Bay]], the {{player}} is seen riding a Lapras even if no Lapras is in the party.
* Lapras is the only {{type|Ice}} to have a [[Gigantamax]] form.
* Lapras can learn the most [[one-hit knockout move]]s of any Pokémon (excluding {{p|Smeargle}}), being able to learn {{m|Sheer Cold}}, {{m|Fissure}}, and {{m|Horn Drill}}.
* The company logos for [[Poké Job|Surf Shipping and Lapras Shipwrights]] depict Lapras.

===Design variations===
Lapras's appearance has had minor alterations during the early years of the franchise. In the documents for the [[Capsule Monsters]] pitch, Lapras was drawn without its curly ears. Furthermore, it was depicted with teeth in its [[Generation I]] official artwork and in [[Pokémon Adventures]].
<gallery>

===Origin===
Lapras may be based on the fabled {{wp|Loch Ness Monster}} in {{wp|Scotland}}. The creature and this Pokémon resemble an extinct order of marine reptiles known as {{wp|Plesiosauria}}, who lived between the {{wp|Triassic}} and {{wp|Cretaceous}} periods. Lapras's shell and horn may be inspired by {{wp|Placodontia|placodonts}} (close relatives of plesiosaurs that lived during the Triassic period). Its intelligence, singing, and rarity is comparable to some {{wp|cetacea}}ns, especially {{wp|blue whale}}s and {{wp|humpback whale}}s. Its long neck and robust body may also be inspired by the mastheads and hulls of {{wp|Viking}} ships. In addition, its shell, combined with its aquatic nature and history of being hunted to near extinction, may be based on {{wp|Sea turtle|sea turtles}}.

As suggested in [[An Illustrated Book of POCKET MONSTERS]], Lapras could be the turtle ridden by the folklore hero {{wp|Taro Urashima}}. Its usage as a form of transport across water may also reference this.

Gigantamax Lapras may be based on a {{wp|cruise ship}} or possibly a {{wp|music box}} or {{wp|ocarina}}.

====Name origin====
Lapras may be derived from ''Laplace'' or {{wp|lapis lazuli}}.

Laplace may be a reference to {{wp|Pierre-Simon Laplace}}, a mathematician who wrote several books on the mathematical properties of the sea and tides. Alternatively, Laplace may be derived from ''la place'' (French for seat), referring to how passengers sit on its back like a seat to be ferried across bodies of water.
