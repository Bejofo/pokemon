'''Latios''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ラティオス''' ''Latios'') is a dual-type {{2t|Dragon|Psychic}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation III]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Latios can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Latios''' using the [[Latiosite]].

It is a member of the [[eon duo]] along with {{p|Latias}}.

==Biology==
Latios is a {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a birdlike body stylized after a plane. Its body flows slowly into a thick neck, giving it a bulky appearance. It has no legs, usually floating instead. Most of its body is blue, with white areas near its arms and a white stripe on its back that extend up to its head. Jet-plane wings sit on top of its back, while two tall, jagged fins point behind it from its rear. A red triangle marks the center of its chest, while a blue mask partially covers its face. Long, ear-like fins extend from its jaws to over its head, and its eyes are red. It has three-fingered arms with a blue covering on the outer side of the lower arms. Latios is a male-only species, with {{p|Latias}} being its female counterpart.

Latios has a gentle nature and will avoid fighting whenever possible. It can fly faster than a jet by tucking in its arms. [[Latios (M05)|In the fifth movie]], {{adv|Eon duo|in Pokémon Adventures}}, and in {{aniseries|JN}}, Latios had the ability "Sight Sharing", which allowed Latias and people around it to see exactly what Latios was seeing. [[Oakley]] also mentioned that it can shape-shift. It prefers compassionate Trainers, to whom it opens its heart. Latios uses telepathy to detect locations and the emotions of others and can understand human speech. It can summon {{m|Luster Purge|explosive light energy}} whenever an offensive situation is required. It lives by the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Water's-edge Pokémon|water's edge}}. As seen in [[Pokémon Horizons: The Series|''Pokémon Horizons'']], like other [[Legendary Pokémon]], Latios can be found in the Pokémon paradise [[Laqua]]. Latios loves [[Latios Treat]]s made by [[Snacksworth]], who once encountered and followed it to a secret spot in the past. Latios can be summoned by the [[Eon Flute]].

Latios is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Luster Purge}}.

===Forms===
Latios can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Latios.

As Mega Latios, the blue parts of its body change to purple. Horns grow from the side of its head and run along its jaw. It loses the wings on its back and similar but larger wings attach to its lower arms, normally held in a level position. Triangle shapes now mark the forward point of its wings instead of its chest.

Mega Latios is said to be one of the fastest Pokémon in the world to exist. Due to Mega Evolving, Mega Latios can achieve even higher speed in flight. Mega Latios is both larger and faster than Mega Latias. It can reach a speed of Mach 4.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150202062726/http://www.pokemonrubysapphire.com/en-us/pokemon/the-eon-pokemon-appear Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire site | Mega Latios]</ref>

In Pokémon Emerald, the roaming Pokémon is chosen in a sequence immediately after the credits where, after hearing a [[television]] report, the player is asked the color of the Pokémon in it. If blue is selected Latios roams Hoenn and Latias is found at the island. If red is selected, Latios is found at the island and Latias roams Hoenn.

===Main series===
====Major appearances====
=====[[Latios (M05)]]=====
Latios debuted in ''[[M05|Pokémon Heroes: Latios & Latias]]''. {{OBP|Annie|M05}} and [[Oakley]] captured Latios and used him to power the [[Defense Mechanism of Alto Mare]], along with the stolen [[Soul Dew]]. Latios ended up sacrificing himself to save [[Alto Mare]] from an enormous tidal wave.

=====Other=====
In ''[[PK16|Pikachu's Ocean Adventure]]'', a Latios and Latias used their powers to help {{AP|Pikachu}}, {{MTR}}, and the other Pokémon search for the legendary "{{p|Wailord}}'s Tear" that was said to be beneath the ocean.

Latios made his animated series debut in ''[[DP189|The Semi-Final Frontier!]]'', under the ownership of {{si|Tobias}}. He was used during Tobias's [[Full Battle]] against {{Ash}} in the semifinals of the [[Lily of the Valley Conference]]. The Eon Pokémon defeated {{AP|Sceptile}} and {{AP|Swellow}}, but was defeated by {{AP|Pikachu}}, who was knocked out at the same time.

In ''[[M18|Hoopa and the Clash of Ages]]'', a Latios capable of [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolving]] was summoned alongside Latias and a {{Shiny}} {{p|Rayquaza}} by {{an|Hoopa}} to protect it from the shadow {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Hoopa|Hoopa Unbound}}.

Eventually, the battle ended after the shadow Hoopa was sealed in a [[Prison Bottle]], and Latios departed alongside Latias for their home.

A Latios appeared in ''[[JN145|Rocket Revengers!]]'', as part of {{an|Latias}}'s vision. In [[JN146|the next episode]], he was revealed to be pursued by a {{OBP|Pokémon hunter|JN146}}. With Latias's assistance, he was rescued by Ash and {{ashfr}}. This Latios has a very stubborn and hot-headed attitude that he still believes that he doesn't trust humans yet easily.

In the opening sequence of ''[[M10|The Rise of Darkrai]]'', a Latios was soaring across the sky alongside a Latias.

'''PAL''': ''Latias and Latios are Eon Pokémon. Both are Dragon- and Psychic-types. The red Latias is female, while the blue Latios is male.

{{-}}

==Trivia==
* Latios shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Latias}}. They are both known as the Eon Pokémon.

===Origin===
Latios and Latias appear to be a cross between a {{wp|Jet aircraft|jet plane}} (due to their wing shape and speedy flight), a {{wp|dragon}}, a {{wp|griffin}}, and a bird. In particular, their lack of feet and continuous levitation might be inspired by the {{wp|common swift}}, a bird with tiny feet (its Latin name ''Apus'' means ''without feet'') that spends most of its life in the air. Similarly, they might be inspired by the {{wp|martlet}}, a mythical bird in English heraldry that never roosts and is usually depicted with tufts of feathers in place of feet. Their red and blue plumage might be based on parrots in the genus {{wp|Eos (bird)|Eos}}. They could also be based on {{wp|junglefowl}} due to their possible {{DL|List of unused Pokémon and character designs|Blaziken / Latias|shared origin}} with {{p|Blaziken}}.

Due to their classification as ''Eon'' Pokémon and their connection to the [[Soul Dew]], Latios and Latias might be inspired by the {{wp|Aeon (Gnosticism)|aeons in Gnosticism}}, which are said to be emanations of God. In {{wp|Valentinianism}}, these aeons form male/female pairs called syzygies. They may also be loosely based on the Chinese philosophical concept of {{wp|yin and yang}}, which are opposite but interconnected natural forces. Latios, being male and the more aggressive of the two, would represent yang. Their names and Latios's signature move {{m|Luster Purge}} might also be a reference to {{wp|Eos}}, the Greek goddess of dawn.

====Name origin====
Latios may be a combination of ''lateō'' (Latin for ''I conceal'', ''I lie hidden'') and ''-os'' (Latin masculine suffix). It might also reference ''{{wp|Eos}}'' (the Greek goddess of dawn) or ''{{wp|Eos (bird)|Eos}}'' (a genus of parrots with red and blue plumage). It's possible that its name is derived from {{wp|Plato}}'s dialogue {{wp|Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaios}}.
