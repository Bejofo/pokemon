'''Vivillon''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ビビヨン''' ''Viviyon'') is a dual-type {{2t|Bug|Flying}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation VI]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Spewpa}} starting at [[level]] 12. It is the final form of {{p|Scatterbug}}.

There are a total of 20 known Vivillon [[#Form data|patterns]], one of which is {{pkmn2|event}}-exclusive.

In [[Generation]]s {{gen|VI}} and {{gen|VII}}, Vivillon's wing pattern depends on the real-world geographic location set on the game the Pokémon was generated in.

In {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, Spewpa will always evolve into Fancy Pattern Vivillon, except if the Spewpa was transferred from another game via {{g|HOME}}, or when the pattern Spewpa can evolve into has been changed by receiving a [[Gift#Postcards|Postcard]] from {{g|GO}}.

(Refer to [[#Form data|Game data&rarr;Form data]] for more details.)

==Biology==
[[File:Pokémon HOME Wallpaper Vivillon.png|thumb|150px|left|The Vivillon wallpaper in Pokémon HOME]]
Vivillon is a butterfly-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with wings that come in a large variety of patterns. It has a round, grayish head with large, black, pixelated eyes and a pair of skinny antennae. The tips of the antennae each have an ovoid scale that is dark gray on the upper half and beige on the lower half. Vivillon's thorax is an ovoid and divided into three segments; each segment is a different shade of gray. Its legs are also ovoid and are dark gray on the lower half, beige on the upper half, and have a black band in the middle. It has two black, circular hands and no visible arms. While Vivillon's wings come in a wide variety of colors and patterns, they always have black edges and pixelated markings. It can spread its scales to poison its opponents during battle or, as seen in the {{aniseries|XY}} episode ''[[XY012|To Catch a Pokémon Smuggler!]]'', to calm an opponent's fighting spirit. It is highly capable of finding sources of water, such as springs.

Vivillon is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Powder}} by leveling up.

===Forms===
Vivillon has 20 separate forms; the pattern of Vivillon's wings is affected by the climate and topography of the environment it lives and is born in.

===Form data===
[[File:Vivillon locations 3DS.png|thumb|Map of Vivillon locations in Generations VI and VII]]
[[File:Vivillon locations 1.png|thumb|Official maps describing Vivillon locations in Generations VI and VII]]
[[File:Vivillon locations 2.png|thumb|Official maps describing Vivillon locations in Generations VI and VII]]
[[File:Vivillon locations GO.png|thumb|Official map describing Vivillon locations via Postcards in Generation IX]]
Vivillon has 20 distinct forms, each having different patterns on its wings. {{p|Scatterbug}} and {{p|Spewpa}} have the pattern of Vivillon that they will evolve into already set when the Pokémon is generated; for {{pkmn|Egg}}s, this means the game in which the Egg was created, regardless of parents. This form cannot be changed.

In [[Generation VI]] and [[Generation VII]], its pattern depends on which geographic location the user specified on the [[Nintendo 3DS]] at the time the save file was created. This affects all Vivillon encountered within the game and can only be changed later by deleting the save file and creating a new one. Due to {{DL|Software region|Nintendo 3DS|region locking}}, a Nintendo 3DS system can only pick from a certain subset of geographic locations, depending on which region the system is from. For a comprehensive list, see [[List of Nintendo 3DS country and region settings]].

In {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, all wild Vivillon will have the Fancy Pattern by default (though other patterns are used by some [[Non-player character|NPCs]]). However, transferring a [[Gift#Postcards|Postcard]] from {{g|GO}} using the [[Mystery Gift]] feature in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet will change the pattern of all wild Vivillon to match the location the Postcard came from. Wild Scatterbug and Spewpa caught after receiving the Postcard will also evolve into Vivillon matching the Postcard's pattern. Scatterbug and Spewpa caught prior to receiving the Postcard will not evolve with the Postcard's pattern. After 24 hours, the wild Pokémon will revert back to Fancy Pattern unless another Postcard has been used. Changing the time and date of the [[Nintendo Switch]] system may end the effect prematurely. An account cannot send more than one Postcard per day, but multiple accounts can be linked each day and can each send a Postcard. A Pokémon Scarlet and Violet save file may not receive the same Postcard more than once. All [[Pokémon breeding|hatched]] Scatterbug will evolve into the Fancy Pattern regardless of Postcard effects. Using the [[Union Circle]] feature, players are able to see and catch wild Vivillon from other players' games, allowing them to catch various patterns of Vivillon regardless of whether they own a matching Postcard. Additionally, if the Scatterbug or Spewpa came from another game like Pokémon GO, it will retain the pattern it was assigned in its original game.

18 of the patterns correspond to certain regions, while the other two do not. The regions corresponding to each pattern differ somewhat between the Nintendo 3DS and Pokémon GO.

** In [[Generation VII]], Vivillon's Pokédex color is white.
** In {{g|HOME}}, each of Vivillon's forms are listed under distinct color groupings based on the color of their wings.
*** Since the release of Pokémon HOME, Vivillon is listed under the most [[Pokédex]] [[List of Pokémon by color|color]] groupings, with a total of nine.
*** Meadow Pattern and Fancy Pattern Vivillon are the only {{DL|List of Pokémon by color|pink}} {{type|Bug}} Pokémon.
*** There currently exists a Vivillon form for every Pokédex color group, except {{DL|List of Pokémon by color|black}}.
* Up until [[Generation IX]], Vivillon could not learn {{m|Iron Defense}} directly, even though its pre-evolved form, {{p|Spewpa}}, was able to learn this move from a Move Tutor.
* As of Generation IX, Vivillon has the most [[Pokédex entry|Pokédex entries]] for a single Pokémon, with 20 per game (one for each form). 
** Prior to [[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet#Version history|Version 1.2.0]], only some <!-- how many? -->of these 20 entries were accessible, as Spewpa could only evolve into Fancy Pattern Vivillon in {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, and only a few <!-- which ones? -->other entries could be gained from NPC encounters.

===Origin===
Considering the many different varieties of Vivillon that differ depending on the player's geographic location, Vivillon may have been based on ''{{wp|Papilio dardanus}}'', which is known for {{wp|Polymorphism (biology)|having over 14 known morphs}}, each of which mimics a different distasteful species of butterfly. Its block-like wing patterns may be based on {{wp|pixel art}}. Modern Pattern Vivillon in particular may be based on modern art, specifically the {{wp|De Stijl}} movement.

====Name origin====
Vivillon and Viviyon may be a combination of ''vivid'' and ''papillon'' (French for butterfly). It may also involve 美 ''bi'' (Japanese for beauty) or ''brillant'' (French for brilliant).
