'''Weezing''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''マタドガス''' ''Matadogas'') is a {{type|Poison}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Koffing}} starting at [[level]] 35.

In [[Galar]], Weezing has a dual-type {{2t|Poison|Fairy}} [[regional form]]. It evolves from Koffing starting at level 35. All Koffing in Galar evolve into this form regardless of their origin.

==Biology==
Weezing is a purple {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} consisting of two spherical heads connected by a thin tube with another sphere in the center. The heads have different sizes and features. The left head is larger and has prominent eyebrows, pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw, and two flat teeth in its upper jaw. The smaller, right head simply has two pointed teeth, one at each corner of its mouth. The larger head has a cream-colored skull-and-crossbones marking below its face, while the smaller head has a ring marking instead. It is covered with many geyser-like protrusions, which usually expel mustard-colored gases. Weezing is said to form when poisonous gases pool and two {{p|Koffing}} fuse over many years. Very rarely, two Koffing can become a Weezing in a short time span because of a sudden mutation. Triplet Weezing have been discovered, although they are extremely rare.

Each of Weezing's heads contains a different toxin. It mixes its gases by inflating one head and deflating the other. When its gases mix, Weezing becomes more toxic and putrid. Weezing can hover in midair, presumably due to gases lighter than air, as is the case for Koffing. Despite their stench and poison, Weezing's gases can be used to make top-grade perfume by diluting them to the highest level.

Weezing lives in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Urban Pokémon|urban areas}}. It seeks a dirty, unkempt house and nests there. At night, when the people in the house are asleep, it will go through the trash. Weezing feeds on the dust, microorganisms, and especially gases emitted by garbage and toxic waste. Weezing's body expands and smells worse upon inhaling poisonous gases. The Kantonian Weezing used to be common in [[Galar]] and created more potent toxins than their Galarian relatives.

Weezing and its pre-evolved form are the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Neutralizing Gas}} as an [[Ability]]. 

===Forms===
[[File:Galarian Weezing absorbing pollutant.png|thumb|left|250px|Galarian Weezing absorbing pollutants from a factory and expelling clean air]]

Weezing has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Galarian}} Weezing.

In the [[Galar]] [[region]], its appearance has changed due to absorbing polluted air from factories. It has a gray body with the skull, crossbones, and ring patterns changed to the color yellow. Both heads have a hat-like tube located on top of them that constantly releases purified air. Five puffs of green poison gas clouds can be seen floating around it. The gas clouds also partly cover its faces: the larger head has a mustache-like cloud on its upper lip, while the smaller head has clouds on its face in the shape of eyebrows and a beard.

Galarian Weezing consumes particles from polluted air and expels clean air instead of droppings. The toxins within Galarian Weezing's body are accumulated into poison gas clouds that leak and drift around it. The gas is its best weapon in battle, being potent enough to stun and immobilize an opponent with just a whiff.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon-galar-region/weezing/ Galarian Weezing | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref> Galarian Weezing preys on {{p|Trubbish}} for the fumes it produces.

Galarian Weezing is also the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Strange Steam}}. Additionally, in [[Generation IX]], Galarian Weezing is the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Misty Surge}} as an [[Ability]].

==Other appearances==
===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]===
When released from a {{i|Poké Ball}}, Weezing will hover in place and emit {{m|Poison Gas}} that juggles any opponent who comes near it, essentially serving the function of its pre-Evolution, {{p|Koffing}}, from [[Super Smash Bros.]]

Weezing also makes an appearance as a float in the [[Poké Floats]] stage. It appears as {{p|Psyduck}} and {{p|Chikorita}} leave. Once {{p|Slowpoke}} appears, it will slowly deflate and move to the top of the screen.

====Trophy information====
''"The evolved form of Koffing, Weezing is basically a pair of Koffing fused together. They tend to float in the air and emit gas or noxious smoke from the outgrowths that cover their bodies. As strange as it may seem, diluting Weezing emissions as much as possible creates one of the most exquisite perfumes known to man."''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Weezing appears as a {{sbw|Spirit}}.

==Trivia==
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Weezing was originally known as "La", representing {{wp|Los Angeles}}' polluted air.
* Weezing is the only {{type|Poison}} Pokémon that {{DL|List of Pokémon by shape|Pokémon consisting of multiple bodies|consists of multiple bodies}}.
** Galarian Weezing is the only {{type|Fairy}} Pokémon that consists of multiple bodies.
* In certain instances in the {{pkmn|games}}, such as summary pages and [[Pokémon Contest]]s, a Pokémon's sprite is horizontally flipped, unless its body is asymmetrical. However, Weezing's sprite is flipped in all instances despite its asymmetrical body.
* The {{3v2|Diamond|Pearl|Platinum}} [[Pokédex entry|Pokédex entries]] for Weezing claim triplet forms have been discovered, but this variant has not been shown in any [[Pokémon]] media.
* Weezing shares similar traits to {{p|Muk}} and {{p|Garbodor}}. All three Pokémon are pure {{type|Poison}} Pokémon with a single pre-evolved form, roughly the same base stat totals and [[Evolution]] levels, and appear to be based on a different kind of pollution; Weezing being air pollution.
* Galarian Weezing is tied with {{p|Xerneas}} as the [[List of Pokémon by height|tallest]] {{type|Fairy}} Pokémon.
* Although Weezing and Galarian Weezing do not appear in {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, the smoke tower on the rooftop of the [[Galaxy Hall]] resembles a Galarian Weezing.
* Kantonian Weezing and its pre-evolved form are the only Pokémon whose {{Abilities}} changed in [[Generation VIII]]. In previous [[generation]]s, their only Ability was {{a|Levitate}}.
* Galarian Weezing can learn more moves that cause it to faint than any other Pokémon ({{m|Self-Destruct}}, {{m|Explosion}}, {{m|Memento}}, and {{m|Misty Explosion}}).
* Galarian Weezing was the first [[Galarian form]] to be officially revealed.
* Galarian Weezing has the shortest duration of time out of all Pokémon between being made available in a mainline game and being made available in {{g|GO}}. It was made available in Pokémon GO in Raid Battles on November 16, 2019, just one day after the release of {{g|Sword and Shield}}.

===Origin===
Considering its looks, its ability to float, and its tendency to explode, Weezing may have been based upon a floating {{wp|naval mine}} or living meteorite. It is also based on smog and other forms of air pollution. It may also be based on the imagined fear that heavy pollution, caused by the leakage and/or improper disposal of toxic and/or radioactive waste, may result in the creation of new and undesirable life forms. Much like Koffing, the symbol under Weezing's larger face resembles the {{wp|skull and crossbones}}, a hazard symbol for poison. The three orbs connected by stems that constitute its body resemble a {{wp|molecule}}. Weezing's fused heads may also be based on {{wp|conjoined twins}} and the effects of pollution-induced birth defects.

Weezing's prominent eyebrow ridges and large bottom teeth evoke the unappealing appearance of mythical creatures like {{wp|troll}}s or {{wp|ogre}}s, often associated with polluted or unclean environments such as swamps, reinforcing its Poison typing. Its features also resemble those of the Japanese {{wp|oni}}, known for their imposing tusks and fearsome presence.

Galarian Weezing takes inspiration from {{wp|steam engine}}s.<ref>(November 15, 2019). "[https://www.4gamer.net/games/451/G045125/20191112090/ 「ポケットモンスター ソード・シールド」インタビュー。「最強」をテーマに，子供たちが楽しめるものを目指して]." ''4Gamer.net''.</ref> Its appearance in particular seems to be based on a stereotypical {{wp|Victorian era}} British gentleman wearing a {{wp|Top hat|chimney hat}}, combined with actual {{wp|chimney}}s. Both its smog-based "facial hair" and its {{pkmn|Sword and Shield|Shield}} Pokédex entry, which describes Weezing taking the form as a result of heavy air pollution, likely draw reference from {{wp|Pea soup fog|the heavy smog}} that afflicted London during the Victorian era. Its ability to clean the air of pollutants may be based on air scrubbers, referring to the fact that they expel clean air as referenced in its {{pkmn|Sword and Shield|Sword}} Pokédex entry. The way Galarian Weezing feeds, absorbing polluted air and then releasing it through the chimney-like tubes on top of their heads as purified air, may have been based on the feeding method of {{wp|Porifera|sponges}}, which are animals that feed through filtration. Water enters the sponge's body bringing food particles (such as microorganisms) and, after being filtered by the animal, is eliminated through the {{wp|osculum}}, a hole in the free end of the animal. Its design may also draw inspiration from nuclear cooling towers, referring to the clouds that they make being steam and not smoke as evidenced by its signature move {{m|Strange Steam}}. Additionally, its {{t|Fairy}} type and appearance may be a reference to {{wp|leprechaun}}s. Galarian Weezing's {{Shiny}} form may be based on {{wp|sepia tone}} photography.

Galarian Weezing's resemblance to Victorian era British noblemen, along with its [[Ability]] {{a|Neutralizing Gas}}, may be a play on {{wp|noble gas}}es, which are gaseous elements known for being highly unreactive and are typically used to prevent unwanted reactions from occuring.

====Name origin====
Weezing may be a corruption of ''wheezing'' (producing a whistling sound while breathing with difficulty).

Matadogas may come from 又 ''mata'' (again) and 毒ガス ''doku-gasu'' (poison gas). It may also be derived from マスタードガス ''masutādogasu'' ({{wp|mustard gas}}).
