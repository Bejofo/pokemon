'''Voltorb''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ビリリダマ''' ''Biriridama'') is an {{type|Electric}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Electrode}} starting at [[level]] 30.

In [[Hisui]], Voltorb has a dual-type {{2t|Electric|Grass}} [[regional form]]. It evolves into Hisuian Electrode when exposed to a [[Leaf Stone]].

==Biology==
Voltorb is a spherical {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that resembles a buttonless {{i|Poké Ball}} with eyes. The top half is red, while the bottom half is white. Because of its resemblance to Poké Balls, it is thought that it was created when one was exposed to an energy pulse. This is supported by the fact that its components do not occur naturally.

Voltorb is generally found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Urban Pokémon|power plants}} and other areas with electric fields where it feeds. It was first discovered in the plant where modern Poké Balls were invented. It has a volatile temperament and will explode if agitated or bumped by the slightest contact. Due to being constantly mistaken as a [[Poké Ball]], Voltorb has reportedly zapped many humans as a result.

===Forms===
Voltorb has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Hisuian}} Voltorb.

Hisuian Voltorb, like its modern counterpart, resemble the [[Apricorn]]-made {{OBP|Poké Ball|Hisui}}s of the time period — both appear to be made of a grainy, woodlike substance, with a glossy surface and a hole on top. On the inside, Hisuian Voltorb's body contains numerous seeds, but it has been impossible to examine its interior due to it being pitch-black.<ref name=LAsite/> Hisuian Voltorb has a distinctive red wooden unibrow. Despite its resemblance to a Poké Ball, it can be inferred that Hisuian Voltorb's existence predates the device's invention, as evidenced by the fact that the ancient hero of Hisui legend had an {{p|Electrode}} companion which would become the ancestor of the region's [[Noble Pokémon|noble]] Electrode.

Hisuian Voltorb can store electric currents in its belly, which it discharges all at once from its hole. Unlike Kantonian Voltorb, Hisuian Voltorb have friendly and excitable temperaments, which leads them to cluster around people, causing them to be a nuisance when they discharge. It is known to let out a great, uproarious laugh whenever it discharges. There are stories of people temporarily plugging the holes of Hisuian Voltorb to prevent them from discharging before removing them from their settlements.<ref name=LAsite>[https://legends.arceus.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon/voltorb/ Hisuian Voltorb | Pokémon Legends: Arceus Official Website]</ref> It has been seen in [[Paldea]] during the rare [[Poké Portal News|Mass outbreak]] events.

===Evolution===
Voltorb evolves into {{p|Electrode}}.

{{rf|Hisuian}} Voltorb evolves into Hisuian Electrode.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Voltorb (TCG)}}

==In the TFG==
One Voltorb figure has been released.

* {{TFG|Next Quest}}: {{TFG ID|Next Quest|Voltorb|23}}

==Trivia==
* In the English and European versions of {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}}, a game called [[Voltorb Flip]] is introduced in place of [[slot machine]]s. The game is similar to Minesweeper and largely focuses on flipping over cards to multiply the coins currently earned. Some cards, however, have Voltorb on them which will cause the {{player}} to lose {{OBP|Coin|Game Corner}}s when flipped.
* Voltorb has the lowest base {{stat|Attack}} stat of all {{type|Electric}} Pokémon.
* According to [[Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]], Voltorb is the only Pokémon recommended for the [[Pokéathlon|Disc Catch]] that is not a {{t|Flying}} type.
* In {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, Voltorb will explode if the player walks too close to it and the Voltorb notices them.
* The Shadow Voltorb in {{g|XD: Gale of Darkness}} is [[List of permanently missable Pokémon|missable]] if players lose to Miror B in the first battle when he has the Voltorb in the Cave [[Poké Spot]], as there is not a flag to make it respawn unlike other Shadow Pokémon. This will lock the player out of catching Voltorb, and as snagging Shadow {{p|Dragonite}} requires snagging every other [[Shadow Pokémon]], the player will be locked out of Dragonite too.
* Unlike their [[Kanto]]nian counterpart, an [[Evolution stone]] is required for Hisuian Voltorb to [[Evolution|evolve]] rather than by leveling up. It shares this trait with {{p|Sandshrew}}.

===Origin===
Voltorb seems to be based upon the concept of a living {{i|Poké Ball}}, and is often mistaken for one. As such, its design may be inspired by ''{{wp|gashapon}}'' capsules, which often consists of a white half and a vibrant colored half. The idea of Voltorb and Electrode being mistaken for the standard Poké Balls that represent items is similar to a {{wp|Mimic (Dungeons & Dragons)|mimic}}, a monster archetype commonly found in RPGs. Its {{Shiny}} coloration is possibly based on a [[Great Ball]].

Voltorb may also be based on a {{wp|ball lightning}}, as hinted by its spherical shape, type, and explosive behavior. Given its tendency to explode and shape, it also shares similarities with common depictions of {{wp|bomb}}s. It may also be based on ''{{wp|tsukumogami}}'', where items acquire a spirit and come to life on their 100th birthday, which might be referenced by Voltorb's [[National Pokédex]] number, which is 100.

The expression on both Voltorb and Electrode may be a personification of the positive and negative charges associated with {{wp|electric charge}}. For their Kantonian forms, Voltorb has a negative angry look, where Electrode has a positive happy look. The polarity of these expressions, or charges, are reversed for their Hisuian forms.

Hisuian Voltorb and its {{t|Grass}} typing may be based on the fact that Poké Balls were originally made from [[Apricorn]]s, which may be based on {{wp|Castanea crenata|Japanese chestnut}} or {{wp|acorn}}s. It may also be based on traditional Japanese fireworks: they are spherical in shape, with shells made of {{wp|papier-mâché}}, charges inside that are often made with rice husks, and a hole where the fuse goes. The fact that it has numerous seeds inside its body may also be inspired by a {{wp|seed ball}} (also known as a seed bomb), which are made by rolling various seeds with clay, forming a ball. The seed ball is then planted or thrown into the ground where vegetation is sparse, so that the seeds will germinate and grow. Hisuian Voltorb's Shiny coloration may be based on an {{hi|Ultra Ball}} or a {{hi|Heavy Ball}}.

====Name origin====
Voltorb may be a combination of ''volt'' and ''orb''.

Biriridama may be a combination of ビリビリ ''biribiri'' (sound of electric shock) and 玉 ''tama'' (sphere).
