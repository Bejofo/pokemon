'''Shellos''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''カラナクシ''' ''Karanakushi'') is a {{type|Water}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation IV]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s into {{p|Gastrodon}} starting at [[level]] 30.

Shellos has [[#Form data|two different forms]]: '''West Sea Shellos''', which is pink and white in appearance, and '''East Sea Shellos''', which is blue and green. They are found on the respective sides of [[Sinnoh]]'s mountain range.<!-- Due to this, there is a myth that the Sinnoh region was once split in two.-->

==Biology==
Shellos is a {{wp|sea slug}}-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} whose appearance changes depending on which part of the sea it is found in. Both forms have amorphous, slug-like bodies, black oval-shaped eyes with yellow outlines, minuscule, dot-shaped noses, and wide yellow lips. Like real-world sea slugs, they have {{wp|Mantle (mollusc)|mantles}} covering the top halves of their bodies. These mantles are outlined in yellow, similar to their eyes. Unlike real sea slugs, however, they have bulbous heads and four small feet rather than one large foot.

The West Sea form's underside is white, and its mantle is pink, with several small spike-like protrusions on its back. On its head is a ring of pink, fleshy knobs resembling the gills of a {{wp|nudibranch}}. West Sea Shellos' appearance is theorized to have been influenced by warm ocean waters.

The East Sea form, meanwhile, sports a green underside and a turquoise mantle. Two yellow-lined, flap-like protrusions, resembling {{wp|cerata}}, are present along its back. On its head are two white-tipped tentacles resembling {{wp|rhinophores}} that extend away from its face. East Sea Shellos's appearance is theorized to have been influenced by cold ocean waters.

Shellos lives along seashores; its color becomes more vibrant the better quality of the waters it lives in. It is also believed that Shellos's diet, which consists of plankton, also influences its form, though this has yet to be proven. The physical differences between both forms appear largely cosmetic; no significant changes in capabilities have been observed. While it can travel onto land, it can only stay on the shore for a limited time before its skin dries out. When Shellos' squishy body is pressed or squeezed, or when Shellos senses imminent danger, a mysterious purple fluid — theorized to be a kind of stress-induced greasy sweat — will ooze out of its body. This fluid is its defense mechanism against enemies; although harmless, it is very sticky and hard to wash off. Shellos has a friendly disposition and is said to have great regenerative capabilities. In the {{pkmn|animated series}}, West Sea Shellos can extend their necks to incredible lengths. It is unknown if the East Sea form can do this as well.

This species once had a shell on its back long ago and is considered a close relative to Pokémon such as {{p|Shellder}}. The [[Nurse Joy]] featured in ''[[DP136|Gateway to Ruin!]]'' revealed [[Mount Coronet]]'s formation led to an {{wp|allopatric speciation}} event, in which the original population of Shellos was separated into two. As a result, Shellos's color and other physical aspects began to vary due to environmental differences and population isolation over time. The two forms are still able to interbreed; the child normally takes the mother's form but takes the father's if bred with a {{p|Ditto}}. Recently, East Sea Shellos' population has been declining, while West Sea Shellos has become more abundant than before.

===Forms===
Shellos has two separate forms: West Sea Shellos and East Sea Shellos. The two forms differ in appearance only.

===Form data===
Shellos has two different forms: West Sea Shellos and East Sea Shellos. In most cases, where it is encountered in the {{pkmn2|wild}} determines its form. This is purely a cosmetic difference, and this Pokémon cannot change between forms.

West Sea Shellos is pink and white in color, whereas East Sea Shellos is blue and green in color. There is also a slight difference in shape depending on the form.

In [[Sinnoh]] and [[Hisui]], West Sea Shellos is encountered west of [[Mount Coronet]], while East Sea Shellos is encountered east of Mount Coronet. In [[Paldea]], West Sea Shellos is encountered in [[West Province (Area Two)]], while East Sea Shellos is encountered in [[East Province (Area One)]] and [[South Province (Area Five)]]; both forms can also be found in [[Tera Raid Battle]]s regardless of location. In other [[region]]s, only one form appears in the wild per game (with the other only obtainable via [[trade|trading]] or [[transfer]]): in {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, Shellos appears as a {{DL|DexNav|hidden Pokémon}}, with West Sea appearing in Omega Ruby and East Sea appearing in Alpha Sapphire; and in [[Alola]] and [[Galar]], only East Sea Shellos appears in the wild.

[[Pokémon breeding|Bred]] Shellos are always the same form as their mother, or the same form as the Shellos or Gastrodon parent if bred with {{p|Ditto}}.

==Trivia==
[[File:Spr b 4d 422b.png|thumb|Shellos's early back sprite]]
* According to an interview in [[Nintendo Power]] with [[Game Freak]], Shellos and {{p|Gastrodon}} were [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire beta|originally]] intended for {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}}.<ref name="NintendoPower">[[Junichi Masuda]]: There's also a sea-slug Pokémon that we weren't able to put in {{2v2|Ruby|Sapphire}} that we were able to put in <nowiki>[</nowiki>{{game|Diamond and Pearl|s}}<nowiki>]</nowiki>... | "Pearls of Wisdom", ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' Issue 215, May 2007, p. 37 ([https://imgur.com/a/kkZqB Scan])</ref>
*Both Shellos and Gastrodon have [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl beta|early]] back sprites that can be found in the game data for {{game|Diamond and Pearl|s}}; however, there are no front sprites for these forms.
*In Diamond and Pearl, no in-game {{pkmn|Trainer}} uses East Sea Shellos in battle, even on the east side of [[Mount Coronet]].
*Shellos's English Pokédex entry for {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}} has the fewest words of any Pokédex entry in the [[core series]] games, with nine. The Pokédex entry is carried over to {{pkmn|X and Y|Pokémon Y}} and {{pkmn|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|Pokémon Alpha Sapphire}}.
**The same is true for {{p|Kyurem}} in {{game|Black and White|s|White}}.
*Prior to Generation VI, Shellos's shape was [[File:Body14.png|32px]].
* Shellos and its Evolution were accidentally released in {{g|GO}} on April 29, 2019, but were removed shortly after. On May 17, 2019, they made their official debut along with various other Pokémon from Generation IV.
*Shellos is the only Pokémon with {{a|Sand Force}} that benefits from its {{weather|sandstorm}} immunity, since all other Pokémon with the [[Ability]] are naturally immune to sandstorm damage due to their typing.

===Origin===
Shellos is based on a {{wp|sea slug}}.<ref name="NintendoPower" /> It resembles various species of {{wp|nudibranch}}, and its ability to secrete purple fluid may be based on {{wp|sea hare}}s, most of which secrete a purplish ink for self-defense.

The {{g|Scarlet and Violet}} Pokédex entries mentioning an increase in West Sea Shellos and a decrease in East Sea Shellos may be referencing changes in the populations of real sea slug species due to climate change, with species that better survive in warmer waters becoming more common.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20220814133258/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-01-18/citizen-science-project-counting-sea-slugs-helps-map-climate/10719706 Citizen science project counting NSW sea slugs helps map effect of climate change on species (retrieved December 2nd, 2022)]</ref>

====Name origin====
Shellos may be a combination of ''shell'' and ''loss'' or ''lost'' (referring to its lack of a shell), or the German suffix ''-los'' (-less).

Karanakushi may be a combination of 殻 ''kara'' (shell), 無くした ''nakushita'' (to have lost), and 海牛 ''umiushi'' (sea slug; nudibranch).
