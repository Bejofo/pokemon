'''Terapagos''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''テラパゴス''' ''Terapagos'') is a {{type|Normal}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced during [[Generation IX]], in [[The Indigo Disk]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Terapagos has {{fd|Terapagos|three forms}}: its''' Normal Form''', its '''Terastal Form''', and a unique {{type|Stellar}} [[Terastal phenomenon#Unique Terastallized states|Terastallized state]] referred to as its '''Stellar Form'''. When it enters a {{pkmn|battle}}, it changes from its Normal Form into its Terastal Form through its {{a|Tera Shift}} [[Ability]], and transforms from its Terastal Form into its Stellar Form upon {{Tera}}stallizing.

Terastal Form Terapagos is the [[game mascot]] of The Indigo Disk, appearing in [[The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero]].

[[Pagogo|Terapagos]] plays an important role in {{aniseries|HZ}}.

==Biology==
[[File:Terapagos dormant state artwork.png|thumb|left|130px|Terapagos in its dormant state]]
Normal Form Terapagos is a small {{wp|reptile|reptilian}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that resembles an indigo {{wp|tortoise}}. Its head, legs, and tail stem from a cyan, hexagonal shell with the Terastal symbol on its back: a white hexagon with triangular extensions on each corner that connects it to the edges of its back. Its neck and legs each have a cyan four-pointed star and ring rub on them. Its feet each have three toes, and its tail has a cyan four-pointed star at its tip. It has two light blue eyes with rouge rimming and four-pointed star-shaped pupils. It has a diamond-like pattern on its forehead and two diamonds hanging like earrings on both sides of its head. Lastly, it has a "ponytail" made up of three segments of diamond-like shapes. The segments reduce in size as they get farther from the head and gain a purplish tint to them.

Normal Form Terapagos is said to have a splendid aura. It is a small and particularly weak Pokémon; for that reason, it can assume a dormant state whenever its life is put in danger or it needs to hibernate, pulling its head, limbs, and tail into its shell and shrinking in size, which makes itself look like an ordinary jewel.<ref>"[https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/news/area_zero_mystery/ Introducing a Newly Discovered Pokémon!]" Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet | Official Website.</ref> It also has the ability to crystallize the energy in its own body to form a green, protective barrier around itself if necessary, even in its dormant state. Through this same ability, Terapagos causes glowing, hard crystals to form around it, even in its dormant state, which gave [[Area Zero]] its distinctive appearance. As depicted in {{aniseries|HZ}}, like other turtles, [[Pagogo|Terapagos]] is unable to move if it is turned upside down, needing outside help to stand back up. It has shown to have an incredibly long lifespan, with one known to have lived for millions of years while slumbering within its shell.

Terapagos is responsible for the [[Terastal phenomenon]]. Terapagos inhabited the [[Paldea]] [[region]] in a bygone era. It was thought that this species went extinct, with it said to have been caught up in seismic shifts that occurred about 2,000,000 years ago. However, {{ga|Terapagos|one of them}} managed to survive by crystallizing its own body and going into hibernation in the [[Area Zero Underdepths]], where it laid low until the present day.<ref>"[https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon/terapagos_normal_form/ Scarlet and Violet | Normal Form Terapagos]" Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet | Official Website.</ref> According to [[Briar]], Terapagos is made of [[Terastal energy]]. [[Heath]] is the one who discovered Terapagos and coined its name.<ref>[[Heath]]: ''"While separated from the research team in the crater's depths, I found a strange...entity. [...] I have tentatively named this creature Terapagos. [...]"'' ([[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet]], in the chapter "A Disk Pokémon?" of the [[Scarlet Book]]{{sup/9|S}}/[[Violet Book]]{{sup/9|V}})</ref> With the power of its crystals, Terapagos can {{m|Tera Starstorm|bombard its foes with star-shaped projectiles}}. After ''[[HZ064|The Approaching Shadow!]]'', [[Spinel]] comes to the conclusion that Terapagos and [[Laquium]] are opposite forces. In ''[[HZ082|Beyond the Shining Rainbow]]'', it was shown absorbing the energy of the [[Tera Shard|crystals]] in Area Zero to power up. In ''[[HZ087|Guided by the Black Rayquaza!]]'', it was also shown gathering its allies' power into itself to power up as well. As shown in [[HZ092]], {{p|Sableye}}, who feed on gemstones and crystals, seem to be interested in Terapagos's crystalline body.

Terapagos also has the ability to alter timelines in some capacity, as seen in the [[core series]] games and {{pkmn|animated series}}. An example if this is it being capable of using [[Crystal Cluster|crystals]] such as the ones from the [[Crystal Pool]] to bring [[human]]s and objects forward from other points in time<ref>[[Professor Sada|AI Sada]]{{sup/9|S}}/[[Professor Turo|AI Turo]]{{sup/9|V}}: ''"[...] It sends Poké Balls to a different point on the timeline to catch Pokémon there, and it can then draw them back here to the present."'' ([[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet]])</ref> as seen with [[Professor Sada]]{{sup/9|S}}/[[Professor Turo]]{{sup/9|V}} who hasn't finished their time machine<ref>[[Professor Sada]]{{sup/9|S}}/[[Professor Turo]]{{sup/9|V}}: ''"I am researching methods to catch Pokémon that live in different timelines, so I might transport them to the present day in my own timeline."'' ([[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet]]: [[The Indigo Disk]])</ref> and [[Rystal]] who had lived 100 years in the past. While using this ability, a mist appears around the affected area; once it disappears, whatever was brought is sent back. As seen in several ''Pokémon Horizons'' episodes, Terapagos also has the ability to create visions of its own memories and even of other people's. Due to the Terastal energy its body produces, Terapagos was responsible for allowing advanced technologies, such as [[Tera Orb]]s, the professor's AI duplicate, and a [[time machine]] that summons [[Paradox Pokémon|Pokémon]] from different points in the timeline or even from other [[Pokémon multiverse|timelines]], to exist in spite of human limitations. Tera Orbs directly exposed to the energy from Terapagos will gain the ability to Terastallize Pokémon without the need to recharge.<ref>[[Briar]]: ''"[...] I think it might be because your orbs were directly exposed to the energy from Terapagos. Kieran and Carmine say that ever since the underdepths, they've been able to Terastallize their Pokémon without charging their Tera Orbs."'' ([[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet]]: [[The Indigo Disk]])</ref> Terapagos also has a strong connection to the {{t|Stellar}} [[type]].<ref>"[https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/news/stellar_tera_type/ Master the Stellar Tera Type—the 19th Tera Type!]" Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet | Official Website.</ref>

Terapagos is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Tera Starstorm}}. Its Normal Form is also the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Tera Shift}} as its [[Ability]].

===Forms===
Terapagos has three forms: Normal Form, Terastal Form, and Stellar Form.

;Terastal Form Terapagos
[[File:Terapagos Terastal Back.png|thumb|left|200px|The type icons morphing on Terastal Form Terapagos's shell]]
Terapagos {{a|Tera Shift|can absorb the energy around itself}} in order to crystallize it and clad its body in a larger, sturdier shell. It also causes the rings on its legs to transform into fur, which forms a mane and three tails, thus transforming into its Terastal Form.

Terastal Form Terapagos is a reptilian Pokémon that resembles an indigo {{wp|sea turtle}}. It now has two patches of voluminous, shiny fur: one near its head, vaguely forming a mane, and the other where its star-tipped tail used to be, vaguely forming three separate tails. The color of its fur varies between a greenish yellow and sky blue. In dark places like caves, this fur glows bright blueish-white. Its hind legs are fully covered by the fur, while only the toes of its front legs are visible, barely poking out of the mane. The eyes remain unchanged from the Normal Form's ones, but they are seen gleaming with the same hue as the fur. The diamond-shaped earrings and ponytail seem to have merged with Terapagos's head.

Terapagos's shell is composed of eighteen irregular pentagons on its surface, each decorated with symbols of varying shapes and colors in a way to resemble the eighteen [[type]] icons. The symbols morph back and forth to abstract shapes. On the center of its shell is a cyan, hexagonal gem adorned with the Terastal symbol, much like the small crystal shell of Normal Form Terapagos. The sides of its shell also have three obtuse pentagons each on the rim of the shell that are a solid light blue color. Due to its lack of legs, Terapagos needs to float to move around in this form.

Normal Form Terapagos enters its Terastal Form when it is either in danger or about to battle. Its shell is composed of crystallized [[Terastal energy]] and holds the power of every type, allowing it to {{a|Tera Shell|distort type matchups and render all damage-dealing moves as ineffective}}.<ref>"[https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon/terapagos_terastal_form/ Terastal Form Terapagos]" Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet | Official Website.</ref> The shell then absorbs the move's energy and transfers it back to Terapagos. When using certain [[special move]]s, Terapagos withdraws its hands and head into its shell, shapes its mane in a way it resembles its three tails, and flies up to fire the move from the gem in the center of its shell. As seen in [[HZ064|''The Approaching Shadow!'']], due to being opposites, in this form, Terapagos can purify [[Laquium]] by absorbing its mist and destroying the crystal itself, which reverts its effects on Pokémon as a result. As seen in ''[[HZ082|Beyond the Shining Rainbow]]'', it is capable of sharing its Terastal energy in the form of an orb with other Pokémon, allowing them to Terastallize, but that forces Terapagos back to its Normal Form. In this form, it is known as "the Indigo Disk", due to its indigo coloration and disk-shaped shell.

Terastal Form Terapagos is the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Tera Shell}} as an [[Ability]].

;Stellar Form Terapagos
When exposed to a [[Tera Orb]], Terapagos will {{Tera}}stallize and become {{type|Stellar}}, thus transforming into its Stellar Form.<ref>"[https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon/terapagos_stellar_form/ Scarlet and Violet Site | Stellar Form Terapagos]" Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet | Official Website.</ref> In {{aniseries|HZ}}, Terapagos has been shown to be able to transform without the need of a Tera Orb.

Stellar Form Terapagos glows and surges with power and is fully coated by {{t|Stellar|a rainbow-colored}} aura. All the icons on its shell become cyan, but the rest of its true body is identical to Terastal Form Terapagos and is seen floating above a large, crystal, indigo dome covered in layers of overlapping hexagons. Under the dome, there are four crystals positioned like the legs of a turtle. The gem on the center of Terastal Form's shell has expanded outward into the shape of a crown bejeweled with rhombuses of varying colors. Atop of the crown-like structure lays a miniature version of Normal Form Terapagos and, above it, the Terastal symbol. Eighteen hexagonal gems orbit around Stellar Form Terapagos's dome, each bearing the icons and colors of one of the eighteen types. Terapagos needs to float to move around in this form as well.
This form is said to resemble the world as the ancients saw it, supposedly due to the dome beneath it. Meanwhile, in the [[Scarlet Book]]{{sup/9|S}}/[[Violet Book]]{{sup/9|V}}, [[Heath]] describes it as an entity, unsure if it is a Pokémon, or even alive to begin with, however, he claims that viewed as a whole, it resembles a mysterious, brilliant disk, and even looks like a planet floating in space. Its Terastal energy becomes so abnormally amplified that it actually appears to lose control and lash out due to its energy output. Due to having so much power, Stellar Form Terapagos may cause cracks around it during its transformation and even risks wreaking havoc to [[Paldea]]'s ecosystem. While in this form, it was shown to resist going into a [[Master Ball]], destroying it in the process.

Stellar Form Terapagos is capable of absorbing [[Terastal energy]] from other Terastallized Pokémon, causing their Terastallized state to be undone earlier than intended, however, it can't do it over and over and it'll eventually fail. It can also create Tera Shields around itself which can only be broken by Terastallized Pokémon. It can even use the power of the Terastal phenomenon to change its type midbattle. The hidden powers within Stellar Form Terapagos are capable of {{a|Teraform Zero|reducing to zero all effects of weather and terrain}}. It has shown to be capable of shooting huge beams of pure Terastal energy at its foes. When using certain [[special move]]s, Terapagos will use all of its hexagonal gems in a certain formation to fire the move from it. As seen in ''Pokémon Horizons'', Terapagos is capable of passing its energy to other Pokémon, encasing them in a crystal orb in the process. This allows Terapagos to, alongside them, achieve feats it cannot do on its own, such as forming a gigantic protective barrier, as seen in ''[[HZ075|The Wonders of the World!]]'' or purifying a large amount of [[Laquium]], as seen in ''[[HZ089|Where the Adventure Leads]]''. This however, will drain away its power, forcing Terapagos into hibernation. In this form, it is also known as "a Disk Pokémon", due to its disk-shaped shell, and "the Hidden Treasure of Area Zero", due to its status as the secret treasure that was sought by the Paldean empire. 

Stellar Form Terapagos is the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Teraform Zero}} as an [[Ability]].

===Form data===
Outside of {{pkmn|battle}}, Terapagos is always in its Normal Form. When it enters a battle for the first time, it changes from its Normal Form into its Terastal Form through its [[signature Ability]] {{a|Tera Shift}} and will never change back to Normal Form until the battle ends, even if it [[faint]]s. As a result, its Normal Form cannot legitimately be used in a battle. Terastal Form Terapagos also has Tera Shift replaced by its other signature Ability {{a|Tera Shell}}. If Terapagos {{Tera}}stallizes during a battle, it transforms into its Stellar Form, adding its third signature Ability, {{a|Teraform Zero}}. Its [[signature move]] {{m|Tera Starstorm}} also changes from {{t|Normal}}- to {{type|Stellar}} and targets both opponents in a [[Double Battle]].

Since the other two forms have higher base HP stats, Terapagos's maximum HP will increase and its current HP will be revised to its new maximum HP minus the amount of HP it had lost before changing form.

Terapagos cannot have its Tera Type changed from {{t|Stellar}} at the [[Treasure Eatery]].

====Major appearances====
=====[[Pagogo]]=====
Terapagos in its dormant state debuted in ''[[HZ001|The Pendant That Starts It All (Part One)]]'', being used by [[Liko]] as a pendant before being properly revealed in its Normal Form in [[HZ002|the following episode]], right before returning to its dormant state. In ''[[HZ023|Fiery Galarian Moltres]]'', it awakened permanently and started traveling with the [[Rising Volt Tacklers]]. It was later revealed to be over 100 years old and that it once travelled alongside its {{pkmn|Trainer}}, [[Rystal]], and her friends, [[Lucius]] and [[Gibeon]]. Terapagos's Terastal Form briefly appeared in ''[[HZ024|Reunion at the Ancient Castle!]]'' as a sketch in Lucius's diary before properly appearing in ''[[HZ033|Roar of the Black Rayquaza]]'' so it could face the [[Black Rayquaza]] and save its friends. In ''[[HZ075|The Wonders of the World!]]'' it was officially caught by Liko, where she adopted the [[nickname]] '''Pagogo''' (Japanese: '''パゴゴ''' ''Pagogo'') from original owner, Rystal. In the same episode, Terapagos's Stellar Form appeared in a flashback before properly appearing in ''[[HZ088|The Earthshaking White Zygarde]]'' to purify all [[Laquium]] alongside the [[Six Heroes]].

====Minor appearances====
In ''[[HZ071|Encounters at the Crystal Pool]]'', a Normal Form Terapagos was shown in a flashback narrated by [[Briar]], where she recounted her ancestor [[Heath]]'s first encounter with the Pokémon in [[Area Zero]].

==Trivia==
[[File:Disc Pokémon.png|200px|thumb|A sketch of Stellar Form Terapagos in the Scarlet/Violet Book]]
* Before the official reveal of Terapagos, a sketch of its Stellar Form appeared in the [[Scarlet Book]]{{sup/9|S}}/[[Violet Book]]{{sup/9|V}}, drawn by [[Heath]] in {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}.
* Terapagos is the only Pokémon whose base stat total changes upon Terastallizing.
* Terapagos has several similarities to {{p|Eternatus}}. Both are [[Legendary Pokémon]] that are responsible for the special type of transformation found within their [[region]]s of origin ([[Dynamax]]/[[Gigantamax]] for [[Galar]] and {{Tera}}stallization for [[Paldea]], respectively) and have entered a state of dormancy sometime in the distant past. Both of them were also introduced in a game which would receive DLC and whose [[game mascot]]s comprise a [[Legendary duo]].
** They also share similar traits regarding their [[form]]s, as both have an exclusive form that increase their [[base stats]] ([[Eternamax]] and Stellar Form) and can absorb the energy related to the phenomena ([[Galar particles]] and [[Terastal energy]]) from other Pokémon, therefore rendering them unavailable, as well as a form that cannot be used by the {{player}}, but have programmed stats (Eternamax and Normal Form).
** In {{aniseries|HZ}}, Stellar Form Terapagos is animated with 3D animation rather than 2D, making it the second Pokémon in the {{pkmn|animated series}} to use 3D animation, with the first being Eternatus in {{aniseries|JN}}.
* Normal Form Terapagos is tied with {{p|Azurill}} and {{p|Shroodle}} for being the [[List of Pokémon by height|shortest]] {{type|Normal}} Pokémon.
* Terapagos is the only Pokémon to have three [[Signature Ability|signature Abilities]], the most out of any Pokémon.
* Terapagos is the only Pokémon with an EV yield total of more than three, with its Terastal Form having a total of four.
** Terapagos is also the only Pokémon with a different EV yield total between each of its forms, with Normal having one, Terastal having four, and Stellar having three.
* While Terapagos as a species has a [[List of Pokémon by gender ratio|50-50 gender ratio]], the only Terapagos encounter is set to always be male. Because of this, a female Terapagos cannot currently be legitimately obtained.
* Terapagos is the only Pokémon in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet that is able to learn moves through [[TM]]s, but not to learn {{m|Tera Blast}} (despite the move using Terastal energy, which Terapagos is responsible for creating).
* Terapagos's [[cry]] is almost identical to the sound that is made when a Pokémon Terastallizes.
** The cry also incorporates the leitmotif commonly associated in-game with [[Area Zero]], Terapagos's habitat. It is more easily distinguished when the cry is played at slower speed.
* One of Stellar Form Terapagos's attack animations has it use the 18 hexagonal gems orbiting its dome to form a symbol and shoot the attack from it. This symbol is the very same one featured in [[The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero]] expansion's logo.
<!--* Terapagos's in-game {{pkmn|category}} is Tera Pokémon, but it is categorized as Terastal Pokémon in the official website for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.-->
* During an {{DL|Let's Go!|Auto Battle}}, Terapagos will transform into its Terastal Form before defeating a [[wild Pokémon]], and then switch back to its Normal Form.
* Despite being the source of the Terastal phenomenon, which contains the power of every type, Terapagos cannot learn any {{t|Ghost}}- or {{type|Flying}} moves.
* In the closed captions of the initial [[TV Tokyo]] broadcast of [[HZ023]], Terapagos was mistakenly referred to as コダイカメ ''Kodaikame'' (from 古代亀 ''kodaikame'', literally "ancient turtle").<ref>[https://twitter.com/DogasusBackpack/status/1705193807460098511 The closed captions for tonight’s #anipoke episode confirm that the Pokémon inside Liko’s pendant is named Kodaikame (コダイカメ). - @DogasusBackpack on Twitter]</ref><ref>[https://twitter.com/anipoke_PR/status/1705215549121396945 本日のアニメ『ポケットモンスター』字幕放送にて、ポケモン・テラパゴスの名称を、正式ではない表記をしておりました。正式な表記は「テラパゴス」です。 - @anipoke_PR on Twitter]</ref>
** This mirrors its internal name from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, where Terapagos is also referred to as "kodaikame".
* Terapagos cannot have its {{Tera|Tera Type}} be changed under normal circumstances in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. If [[Cheating|the game is modified]] to force Terapagos to have a different Tera Type, the game will lag significantly while Terastallizing; however, unlike with {{p|Ogerpon}}, the game will not {{DL|Game freeze|Softlocking|softlock}}. {{a|Illusion}} will also not work if either Terapagos or the Pokémon with the Ability Terastallizes.

===Origin===
Terapagos may be based on a {{wp|sea turtle}}, specifically the {{wp|Green sea turtle#Galápagos green turtle|Galápagos green turtle}}, a population of green sea turtles found around the {{wp|Galápagos Islands}}. It, especially in its Normal Form, may also be based on the {{wp|Galápagos tortoise}}; in particular, it may be inspired by {{wp|Lonesome George}}, the last {{wp|Pinta Island Tortoise}} (a subspecies of Galápagos tortoise), as Terapagos is said to be extinct aside from a lone male survivor.

Terapagos may be inspired by the rainbow-shelled turtle from the Japanese folktale about a fisherman named {{wp|Urashima Tarō}}. In the story, this turtle carries Tarō to the Dragon Palace beneath the sea, a detail that may be reflected by the concept of the mostly underwater [[Blueberry Academy]] (the main setting of [[The Indigo Disk]], in which Terapagos was introduced). Additionally, the story ends with the fisherman aging rapidly into an old man with long white hair, similar to how Terapagos changes form when it enters battle.

The Terastal Form's hairy appearance may be a reference to Japanese legends of the ''{{wp|Cultural depictions of turtles#Japan|minogame}}'', a turtle which lived for 10,000 years and grew a tail made of {{wp|seaweed}}. Terapagos, especially in its Stellar Form, may also reference the {{wp|World Turtle}}, a mythical turtle found in various mythologies that was said to carry the world upon its back. This connection is furthered by the Stellar Form's Pokédex entries, which state that it resembles "the world as the ancients saw it" and "a planet floating in space". By extension, Terapagos's Stellar Form may be a reference to the expression "{{wp|turtles all the way down}}", as it has a crystal in the shape of its Normal Form above its shell, and it floats on top of a larger dome shaped like a tortoise shell. The expression "turtles all the way down" refers to the idea that the World Turtle rests on the back of a larger turtle, and that turtle rests on the back of an even larger turtle, and so on.

The tessellation on Terapagos's shell contains [[type]] icons and could be based on the unique pattern on the back of the {{wp|diamondback terrapin}}. Terapagos's crystalline composition may also take inspiration from {{wp|chitons}}, marine mollusks with flat disk-shaped bodies and eye-like peripherals composed of rock.

====Name origin====
Terapagos may be a combination of ''{{Tera}}stal'', ''{{wp|terrapin}}'', and ''galápagos'' (a Spanish word for turtles, most recognizable because of the {{wp|Galápagos Islands}}).
