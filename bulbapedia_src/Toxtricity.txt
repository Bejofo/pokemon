'''Toxtricity''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ストリンダー''' ''Strinder'') is a dual-type {{2t|Electric|Poison}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation VIII]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Toxel}} starting at [[level]] 30. The [[#Form data|form]] it evolves into depends on its [[Nature]] (unaffected by [[mint]]s).
* Toxel evolves into '''Amped Form''' Toxtricity if its Nature is Hardy, Brave, Adamant, Naughty, Docile, Impish, Lax, Hasty, Jolly, Naive, Rash, Sassy, or Quirky.
* Toxel evolves into '''Low Key Form''' Toxtricity if its Nature is Lonely, Bold, Relaxed, Timid, Serious, Modest, Mild, Quiet, Bashful, Calm, Gentle, or Careful.

Toxtricity has a [[Gigantamax]] form, which is the same regardless of its form. It can Gigantamax into '''Gigantamax Toxtricity''' if it has the {{DL|Gigantamax|Gigantamax Factor}}.

==Biology==
Toxtricity is a bipedal, lizard or salamander-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with two forms. Both Amped Form and Low Key Form Toxtricity have purple-colored bodies and white eyes with black irises. Both forms also have four spikes on the back, four spikes on each wrist, and a crescent-shaped body part with seven light purple spikes on the waist.

By clawing at the organs on their chests, both forms of Toxtricity can generate over 15,000 volts of electricity, as well as sound. The sounds they make resemble those of electric string instruments: a standard guitar for Amped Form, and a bass guitar for Low Key Form. Toxtricity chugs stagnant water to absorb the dissolved toxins, which it then breaks down in order to generate electricity. Toxtricity is very popular with several youths who admire the way it listlessly picks fights with any foe it faces and keeps its cool no matter what.

Toxtricity is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Overdrive}}, as well as the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Punk Rock}} as an [[Ability]].

===Forms===
Toxtricity has three forms: Amped Form, Low Key Form, and [[Gigantamax]] Toxtricity.

;Amped Form Toxtricity
Amped Form Toxtricity has a slouched posture. It has a yellow underbelly, yellow stripes on its legs, and yellow accents on its back, palms, and soles. It also has a yellow electric frill that extends from its snout to its neck. Two additional electric spikes protrude from its back. It has four horns: two smaller ones above its eyes, and two larger ones on the sides of its head. Six purple organs protrude from its chest. 

Amped Form Toxtricity are known to be short-tempered and extremely confident. This form aggressively attacks anything that makes eye contact with it.<ref name="Amped">[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon-galar-region/toxtricity-amped-form/ Toxtricity (Amped Form) | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref> As mentioned in [[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]], Amped Form Toxtricity occasionally strumming its chest protrusion while it sleeps. If one hears intense guitar music at night, it is said to be the sound of a half-asleep Amped Form Toxtricity. Amped Form Toxtricty has four different sleep styles: ''Seated Sleep'', ''Signature-Pose Sleep'', ''Guitar-Strumming Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''.

;Low Key Toxtricity
Low Key Form Toxtricity has an upright posture, with its neck standing tall. It has a light blue underbelly, light blue stripes on its legs, and light blue accents on its back, palms, and soles. It has a large fin-like horn in front of its face, and two smaller horns on the sides of its head. Its two light blue electric frills run from the base of its larger horn, and down to its neck. Four purple organs protrude from its chest.

Low Key Form Toxtricity are known to be selfish and dismissive of others and have high regard towards their strength. This form taunts its opponents into fighting it when making eye contact with them.<ref name="LowKey">[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon-galar-region/toxtricity-low-key-form/ Toxtricity (Low Key Form) | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref> According to the [[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]], Low Key Form Toxtricity has been observed acting like it is strumming a musical instrument while it sleeps. It is speculated that this form of Toxtricity dreams of being on stage, performing with rhythmic bass guitar sounds while generating electricity. Low Key Toxtricity has four different sleep styles: ''Seated Sleep'', ''Bass-Strumming Sleep'', ''Loafing Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''.


;Gigantamax Toxtricity
[[File:849Toxtricity-Gigantamax 2.png|left|thumb|200px|Gigantamax Toxtricity can create a guitar out of its stored electricity]]
Toxtricity's two forms share the same Gigantamax form. As Gigantamax Toxtricity, it has a larger appearance that resembles a combination of its two forms. It walks on all fours, but it is also capable of standing on its hind legs. It has a dark purple body with a dark pink underbelly and dark pink accents on its back, soles, and hind legs. Its spikes and the crescent-shaped body part on its waist turn bright pink, and from its waist grows a tail resembling a {{wp|transmission tower}}, and two protrusions that resemble conductor coils. Three red clouds surround its tail. It has four horns on its head, and three large electric frills that run from between its horns down to its back: a yellow one at the center, and two light blue ones flanking it on either side. Its eyes have light blue sclerae and yellow pupils, which extend outside of its sclerae, resembling stars. Its chest has two light blue and four yellow organs protruding.

Gigantamax Toxtricity's main weapon is its excessive electric energy, which contains more electricity than a thundercloud. It can store up to one million liters of poison. This poison penetrates Gigantamax Toxtricity's brain and causes it to go berserk, leaking toxic sweat all over its body like acid rain. To attack, Gigantamax Toxtricity uses its stored electricity to create a guitar-shaped mass and slams it down toward opponents, similar to the act of guitar smashing real rock singers do. The energy and momentum of this attack are powerful enough to create a giant crater.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon-galar-region/gigantamax-toxtricity/ Gigantamax Toxtricity | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref> 

Gigantamax Toxtricity is the only known Pokémon capable of using the [[G-Max Move]] {{m|G-Max Stun Shock}}.

===Form data===
Toxtricity has two non-interchangeable forms: Amped Form and Low Key Form. 

When {{p|Toxel}} [[Evolution|evolves]] into Toxtricity, the form it evolves into depends on its [[Nature]] (unaffected by [[mint]]s):

Toxel will evolve into Amped Form Toxtricity if its Nature is Hardy, Brave, Adamant, Naughty, Docile, Impish, Lax, Hasty, Jolly, Naive, Rash, Sassy, or Quirky.

Toxel will evolve into Low Key Form Toxtricity if its Nature is Lonely, Bold, Relaxed, Timid, Serious, Modest, Mild, Quiet, Bashful, Calm, Gentle, or Careful.

Both forms of Toxtricity have the same [[base stats]], but they learn slightly different [[move]]s and have different possible {{Abilities}}. Both forms have access to the same [[Gigantamax]] form.

==Trivia==
* No other Pokémon have the same [[List of Pokémon with unique type combinations|type combination]] as Toxtricity and its {{p|Toxel|pre-Evolution}}.
* Toxtricity is the only Pokémon with a base stat total of 502.
* All of the Natures that lower the Attack stat (Bold, Timid, Modest, Calm) only belong to Low Key Form Toxtricity; likewise, all of the Natures that lower the Special Defense stat (Naughty, Lax, Naive, Rash) only belong to Amped Form Toxtricity.
* Toxtricity, its pre-Evolution, and its Gigantamax form were all designed by [[Yusuke Kozaki]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/kymg/status/1341384533459910656 Tweet by コザキユースケ/Yusuke Kozaki (@kymg).] Posted on December 22, 2020.</ref><ref>[https://twitter.com/kymg/status/1525743204259098624 Tweet by コザキユースケ/Yusuke Kozaki (@kymg).] Posted on May 15th, 2022.</ref>

===Origin===
Visually, Toxtricity resembles {{wp|lizard}}s, especially the ones from the {{wp|Agama (lizard)|Agama}} genus, like the {{wp|Mwanza flat-headed rock agama}} and the {{wp|Agama planiceps|Namib rock agama}}. Like Toxtricity, this genus is known for displaying a variety of bright colors and possessing spikes on the region of the ear.

Alternatively, Toxtricity may be based on {{wp|newt}}s, which are a type of salamander. Newts are poisonous, have rounded toes, and lizard-like bodies. The {{wp|Northern crested newt}} in particular resembles Toxtricity, sharing its jagged crest, yellow underbelly, and spots resembling the chest protrusions. The spikes on the side of the Pokémon's head are reminiscent of the gills newts have in their larval stage.

Toxtricity also appears to be based on {{wp|punk rock}} {{wp|guitarist}}s. Its Amped and Low Key forms resemble {{wp|electric guitar}}s and {{wp|bass guitar}}s; the number of their chest organs equals the number of strings on each guitar (six and four, respectively), and they make sounds similar to those of the respective instruments when strummed.<ref name="Amped"/><ref name="LowKey"/> Its appearance features several fashion elements commonly associated with punk, such as the {{wp|mohawk|mohawk hairstyle}}, torn pants, and spiked bracelets and belts. Gigantamax Toxtricity's ability of generating a guitar-shaped spark to attack may be a reference to {{wp|Instrument destruction|guitar smashing}}, a common act by guitarists at the end of a concert set where they smash their guitar against the floor. The pink and yellow coloration of its shiny form when in Amped Form greatly resembles the colors used in the album art of seminal British punk rock band {{wp|Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols|Sex Pistols' debut record}}, commonly cited as one of the first full-length records of the UK punk movement.

====Name origin====
Toxtricity may be a combination of ''toxic'' or ''toxicity'' and ''electricity''.

Strinder may be a combination of ''strings'' (of a stringed instrument) and ''salamander''.
