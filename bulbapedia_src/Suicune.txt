'''Suicune''' (Japanese: '''スイクン''' ''Suicune'') is a {{type|Water}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation II]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

Along with {{p|Raikou}} and {{p|Entei}}, it is one of the [[Legendary beasts]] resurrected by {{p|Ho-Oh}} after the burning of the [[Burned Tower|Brass Tower]]. Of the three Legendary beasts, Suicune is said to represent the rains that quenched the flames of the burning Brass Tower. It is pursued in ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'', [[Pokémon Adventures]], {{game|Crystal}}, and {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}} by [[Eusine]].

The [[Paradox Pokémon]] {{p|Walking Wake}} is said to be either an ancient relative of Suicune or a counterpart of it from a parallel timeline.

Suicune is the [[game mascot]] of {{game|Crystal}}, appearing on the boxart.

==Biology==
[[File:Sugimori Suicune AG.jpg|thumb|left|250px|{{aniseries|AG}} reference sheet]]
Suicune is a slim, quadrupedal, blue, mammalian {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with white, diamond-shaped markings. Its face and underside are white as well. Suicune has a thick, purple mane that resembles the {{wp|aurora borealis}} and two white, streamer-like tails that wave forward. It has a long, white snout. Suicune has a large, hexagonal, cerulean blue crest on its forehead with two prongs on either side of the base. It has red eyes, a small tuft of fur under its chin, and small paws with white paw pads.

150 years ago, [[Burned Tower|Brass Tower]] in [[Johto]] was hit by a lightning bolt, causing it to catch on a huge fire and would be later put out by a sudden downpour. [[List of disputed and unidentified Pokémon|Three unnamed Pokémon]] perished in the fire, however, the [[Legendary Pokémon]] {{p|Ho-Oh}} granted the trio new life, one of those Pokémon was revived as Suicune, which represents the rain that put out the fire on the now Burned Tower.

Suicune has the power to walk across water and purify dirty water with one touch. It travels across {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|grasslands}} in search of water to purify by following the north wind. Northern winds always seem to blow stronger in its presence. In {{game|Crystal}}, Suicune is said to be the closest of the [[Legendary beasts]] to {{p|Ho-Oh}} and shares a cooperative bond with the {{p|Unown}}.<ref><blockquote><p>Of the legendary POKéMON, SUICUNE is said to be the closest to HO-OH. I hear there may also be a link to POKéMON known as UNOWN. The POKéMON UNOWN must be sharing a cooperative bond with SUICUNE."</p><p>Wise Trio, [https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/maps/TinTower1F.asm Pokecrystal Disassembly]</p></blockquote></ref> Suicune's personality is said to be heroic, serious, and calm during dangerous situations, as depicted in ''[[DP028|Drifloon On the Wind!]]''. Suicune is believed to be both the embodiment of the north winds and compassion of pure spring waters. Suicune loves [[Suicune Treat]]s made by [[Snacksworth]], who once encountered and rode with it in the past. {{p|Walking Wake}} shares a resemblance to Suicune and is believed to be its ancient ancestor.

As mentioned in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Suicune can be observed sleeping deeply in locations where the water is clean. When Suicune awakens, it will start racing around the world once more, following the north wind to purify fouled water. Suicune is known to enjoy eating Suicune Biscuits. Suicune can be lured over to a sleeping spot using the Suicune Incense. Suicune has three different sleep styles it sleeps in, they are called ''Energy-Storing Sleep'', ''Meditative Sleep'', and ''Northern-Wind Sleep''.

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
* {{game|Crystal}}: It is possible to see Suicune multiple times on the overworld &mdash; specifically in [[Cianwood City]], outside [[Mt. Mortar]] on {{rt|42|johto}}, and on {{rt|36|johto}} just beside the gate to [[National Park]], in that order &mdash; before the actual battle in the [[Bell Tower|Tin Tower]]. On these occasions, it will always hop away on being spotted, and then reset the event on the next route, creating an infinite loop that replicates its roaming status in Gold and Silver. Once Suicune is captured or defeated, it cannot be seen on those routes again.
* {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}}: As in Crystal, Suicune will roam Johto and Kanto before finally battling the player. After being first seen in the [[Burned Tower]], it runs to [[Cianwood City]], {{rt|42|johto}}, {{DL|Vermilion City|Port|Vermilion Port}}, and {{rt|14|Kanto}} before becoming battleable at the end of {{rt|25|Kanto}} after defeating [[Misty]]. If it is not caught, Suicune can be found in the Burned Tower after entering the [[Hall of Fame]] again.
{{spoilers}}
* {{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}}: Suicune first appears with {{p|Raikou}} on [[Revelation Mountain]] to confront {{mdc|Krookodile|smd}}, believed to have turned {{p|Entei}} to stone, only to discover that {{mdc|Nuzleaf|smd}} was the true culprit. Later, Suicune helps the {{player}} and their team [[Partner Pokémon (Mystery Dungeon)|partner]] escape from the [[Voidlands]]. Known as "Suicune the Gale", Suicune is notably kinder than Entei and Raikou, never talking down to or threatening the player, their partner, or {{p|Mawile}}.

===Main series===
====Major appearances====
[[File:Suicune anime.png|thumb|250px|Suicune in {{aniseries|HZ}}]]
[[File:Suicune M13.png|thumb|250px|{{Shiny}} Suicune in ''[[M13|Zoroark: Master of Illusions]]'']]
=====Suicune (recurring)=====
Suicune debuted in ''[[EP117|Don't Touch That 'dile]]'', where {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} first encountered one as they were heading towards [[New Bark Town]]. Suicune was seen standing on a small island in a lake, appearing as a mysterious silhouette of blue energy. At first, Ash did not understand what Pokémon it was and wanted to {{pkmn2|caught|catch}} it. However, Suicune leaped into the fog and vanished as soon as Ash made an attempt to {{pkmn|battle}} it.

The same Suicune reappeared in ''[[EP227|For Ho-Oh the Bells Toll!]]''. After {{TRT}} had removed the [[Clear Bell|Crystal Bells]] from {{ci|Ecruteak}}'s [[Bell Tower|Tin Tower]], many {{type|Bug}} Pokémon invaded the city. They wrapped [[Jessie]], [[James]], and {{MTR}} in a {{m|String Shot}} and blocked off the entry to the Tin Tower. Suicune appeared in a mystical blue light and calmed the [[wild Pokémon]] down. Seeing the [[Legendary Pokémon]], [[Jessie]] had {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}} launch a {{m|Poison Sting}}, but Suicune evaded the attack and sent Team Rocket blasting off with an {{m|Aurora Beam}}.

[[Eusine]] wanted to catch Suicune and sent out his {{p|Alakazam}} to battle it. Alakazam used {{m|Disable}}, but Suicune easily blocked it with a {{m|Mirror Coat}}. It then used {{m|Roar}} to send Alakazam back into its {{i|Poké Ball}} and fled from the area before Eusine could even react. The brief encounter led Eusine to pursue Suicune, in the hopes of seeing it again one day.

Its known moves are {{m|Aurora Beam}}, {{m|Mirror Coat}}, and {{m|Roar}}.

=====[[Suicune (M04)]]=====
In ''[[M04|Celebi: The Voice of the Forest]]'', a Suicune participated in the battle against the {{OBP|Celebi|M04}} corrupted by the [[Iron-Masked Marauder]]'s [[Dark Ball]]. It also demonstrated its ability to purify water by purifying the [[Lake of Life]].

Goh {{pkmn2|caught}} Suicune in order to save and heal it. In the end, even though the hunters were arrested and Goh attempted to {{pkmn2|released|release}} Suicune, it chose to remain under his ownership while {{pkmn2|roaming}} the {{pkmn|world}}, occasionally returning to the [[Cerise Laboratory]] to see him again.

Despite both [[Eusine]] and {{adv|Crystal}} pursuing Suicune and attempting to catch it, Suicune eventually chose [[Misty]] as its Trainer after battling her at [[Tohjo Falls]].

{{-}}

==Trivia==
* Suicune is the only box art Legendary to have a base stat total below 600.
* Suicune's numbers in the [[National Pokédex]] and the [[List of Pokémon by Johto Pokédex number|Johto Pokédex]] are identical: 0245 and 245, respectively.
* Suicune is the only member of a [[Legendary trio]] to also be a [[game mascot]] while its fellow members are not.
* Suicune is the only [[Shadow Pokémon]] that can have a varying moveset. Normally knowing {{m|Surf}} if [[Snagging|snagged]] in [[The Under]] or [[Realgam Tower]], Suicune instead knows {{m|Hydro Pump}} if it is snagged in [[Deep Colosseum]].

===Concept and development===
Suicune's [[Pokémon Gold and Silver Spaceworld '97 demo]] design features a more unshaven, dishevelled Suicune, with bangs covering the eyes and tail fur tied together by an orb. In the final game, Suicune's sprite is seen with a purple faceplate, which was changed to a clearer blue in {{game|Crystal}}.

Suicune, along with {{p|Raikou}} and {{p|Entei}}, was designed by [[Muneo Saitō]].<ref>Yoshida, Yuuya (May 1, 2014). [https://kai-you.net/article/5034 伝説ポケモンのイラストを手がける斉藤むねお、キャラデザ講座開講！] Kai-You.</ref><ref>(January 3, 2012). Ken Sugimori ([https://twitter.com/SUPER_32X @SUPER_32X]) [https://twitter.com/SUPER_32X/status/154156622212640768 on Twitter]. ([https://archive.vn/WfQab archive])</ref> When asked if the [[Legendary beasts]] were based on any particular animals, Muneo Saitō explained that after {{p|Entei}}'s design came to be lion-like, he decided to incorporate leopard-like and tiger-like elements for Suicune and Raikou, respectively. Suicune's creation process was described as having come together easily.<ref name="Saitō">(January 3, 2012). Muneo Saitō ([https://twitter.com/muneondo @muneondo]) [https://twitter.com/muneondo/status/154176395826835456 on Twitter]. ([https://archive.vn/xccqr archive])</ref>

===Origin===
Suicune is partially based on a {{wp|leopard}}. <ref name="Saitō"/> Suicune and its {{t|Water}} typing represent the rain that put out the [[Burned Tower|Brass Tower]] according to its legend, while {{p|Raikou}} represents the lightning that struck it, and {{p|Entei}} represents the fire that burned it.

Due to its slender build, horn-like crest, and ability to walk on water, Suicune may be based on a {{wp|Qilin}}. Additionally, Suicune may reference some aspects of {{wp|Fūjin}}— a Japanese god of wind, who's commonly depicted as wearing a leopard loincloth and carrying a bag of wind. Furthermore, Suicune's references to {{wp|aurora}}s and representation of the north wind may point to it also being loosely based in other deities such as {{wp|Aurora (mythology)|Aurora}} and {{wp|Boreas}}.

====Name origin====
Suicune may be a combination of 水 ''sui'' (water), 水晶 ''suishō'' ((water) [[Pokémon Crystal Version|crystal]]; also referring to a high-purity quartz), and 君 ''kun'' (monarch/baron).
