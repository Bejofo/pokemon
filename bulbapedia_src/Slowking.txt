'''Slowking''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ヤドキング''' ''Yadoking'') is a dual-type {{2t|Water|Psychic}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation II]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s from {{p|Slowpoke}} when [[Trade Evolution|traded]] while holding a [[King's Rock]]. It is one of Slowpoke's final forms, the other being {{p|Slowbro}}.

In [[Galar]], Slowking has a dual-type {{2t|Poison|Psychic}} [[regional form]], introduced in {{g|Sword and Shield}}'s 1.3.0 patch. It evolves from {{rf|Galarian}} Slowpoke when exposed to a [[Galarica Wreath]]. It is one of Galarian Slowpoke's final forms, the other being Galarian Slowbro. These Slowking can also be found in [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]]. 

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for these details.)

Slowking was officially revealed in the May 1997 issue of [[CoroCoro]], along with {{p|Donphan}} and {{p|Ampharos}}.<ref>https://www.zoidsland.com/1rebyu-/koro97-5b.html</ref>

==Biology==
[[File:WillSlowkingVS77.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Shellder's eyes]]
Slowking is a bipedal {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a {{p|Shellder}} latched onto its head. It is primarily pink, with a pale yellow muzzle and scaled belly. Its feet and hands each have a single clawed digit, while the hands also have a clawless thumb. Around its neck is a spiny ruff with alternating red and white stripes. The Shellder on its head has a spiral shape with two horns near the base. A red gem resides in the center of the Shellder. The Shellder's eyes are visible on the back of the Shellder.

Shellder's bite releases venom into Slowpoke's brain, causing a chemical chain-reaction that unlocks a superior intelligence and extraordinary power. More venom is injected into Slowking every time it yawns. The more venom the Shellder releases, the more intelligent Slowking will become. However, if the Shellder on its head comes off, it will forget everything it has learned and would [[devolution|revert]] itself back to Slowpoke. As seen in ''[[JN026|Slowking's Crowning!]]'', Slowking's Shellder crown can take control of a human who wears the crown. Slowking's intelligence can match that of a human and it constantly attempts to learn more. Its inspiration and intuition are also highly developed, and Slowking is able to stay calm in any situation and plan situations with effective results; this allows Slowking to solve anything. In the games, Slowking's speech is said to be unintelligible; however, in ''[[M02|The Power of One]]'', it can [[Talking Pokémon|understand and speak the human language]].

According to [[The Complete Pokémon Pocket Guide]], it has such an easygoing personality that it is never stressed. Slowking is rarely found in the wild, though it can be found [[List of Pokémon by habitat#Water's-edge Pokémon|by the water's edge]]. It [[Slowking's Day|has been seen]] eating seaweed and drinking coconut milk. In [[Alola]], it is known as "the sage of the sea", and it occasionally matches wits with {{p|Oranguru}} by the beach. As mentioned in {{g|Sleep}}, Slowking is known to be dreaming world-changing ideas while it sleeps.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref>However, it forgets all of them the moment Slowking wakes up.

Slowking is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Chilly Reception}}. 

===Forms===
Slowking has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Galarian}} Slowking.

In [[Galar]], Shellder's bite causes a different chemical reaction in the brain due to the [[Galarica Twig|Galarica]] spices that make up Galarian Slowpoke's diet, causing Galarian Slowking to take on a [[Galarian form|unique appearance]]. The tip of its tail and the top half of its body are purple, and it has a long dark cloak that drapes from its neck. The Shellder has grown more dominant, appearing completely different with a rougher texture, a darker gray coloration, and a larger size, covering Slowking's eyes and nostrils. It has several purple spots dotting it, with a large one at the center that surrounds a green gem and two black eyes. The spikes on the Shellder are more blunt, and it has two purple horn-like tubes on either side from which poison may be secreted. The Shellder's teeth have also grown in size and are broad and flat instead of sharp; the same holds true for its wearer.

As Galarian Slowking evolves, the Shellder on its head has its intelligence skyrocket, giving it the ability to control the Slowking, as well as psychic powers that can rival the power of other {{type|Psychic}} Pokémon. Galarian Slowking has been observed chanting mysterious spells and incantations in battle or to communicate with each other. It also chants these spells while creating strange potions using its internal toxins. What these incantations and spells mean has yet to be fully understood.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/expansionpass/pokemon/galarian-slowking/ Galarian Slowking | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref> Galarian Slowking is capable of creating potions by mixing toxins it produces with the food it consumes. These potions are derived and secreted from poison and the holes on Galarian Slowking's horns. However, not even Galarian Slowking itself will have any idea what effects the potions it produces will have. It will administer the potions it creates to weaken any Pokémon it sees fit to test on. They can also be found in the [[Coastal Biome]] of [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]], where Galar's regional life is simulated. As seen in ''[[JN097|An Evolution in Taste!]]'', Galarian Slowking's Shellder crown retains the same ability to control humans like its Johto counterpart.

Galarian Slowking is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move {{m|Eerie Spell}}, as well as the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Curious Medicine}} as its [[Ability]].

===Evolution===
Slowking evolves from {{p|Slowpoke}} and is one of its final forms, the other being {{p|Slowbro}}.

{{rf|Galarian}} Slowking evolves from Galarian Slowpoke. It is one of its final forms, the other being Galarian Slowbro.

===Evolution data===
====Slowking====
Slowking [[Evolution|evolve]]s from {{p|Slowpoke}} when [[Trade Evolution|traded]] while holding a [[King's Rock]].  Slowpoke cannot evolve into Slowking in {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}} before the player obtains the [[National Pokédex]], as its Evolution will be interrupted. Slowpoke also cannot evolve into Slowking in {{LGPE}}, as Slowking is not present in those games.

====Major appearances====
=====[[Slowking (M02)]]=====
A {{pkmn2|talking}} Slowking debuted in ''[[M02|The Power of One]]'', where he gave {{Ash}} advice on where to find the Island Treasures. His daily activities were revealed in ''[[Slowking's Day]]''.

Slowking also appeared in ''[[M20|I Choose You!]]'', which is set in an alternate continuity from the main series.

=====Slowking (recurring)=====
In ''[[JN026|Slowking's Crowning!]]'', a Slowking living on [[Slowpoke Island]] had its crown removed. It reappeared in ''[[JN097|An Evolution in Taste!]]'', where the same happened again. This Slowking loves {{wp|udon}}.

Slowking's only known move is {{m|Psychic}}.

=====Other=====
In ''[[EP260|A Crowning Achievement]]'', a colony of {{p|Slowpoke}} was attempting to reach a [[King's Rock]] in order to evolve into a Slowking so that they could help save the colony from a drought. The Slowpoke were faced with many problems since the King's Rock was also surrounded by {{p|Shellder}}, and whenever they failed to reach it, they would evolve into a {{p|Slowbro}} instead. One Slowpoke, [[nickname]]d Arthur, which was owned by [[Alice Telesu]], tried reaching the King's Rock and eventually succeeded, thus marking Slowking's animated series debut. In the end, he left Alice in order to be the leader of the colony. Arthur reappeared in {{AP|Larvitar}}'s vision in ''[[EP263|Address Unown]]''.

In ''[[DP050|Tag! We're It...!]]'' and ''[[DP052|Smells Like Team Spirit!]]'', [[Conway]] used a Slowking in the [[Hearthome City Tag Battle Competition]].

===Pokémon Origins===
In ''[[PO04|File 4: Charizard]]'', a Slowking was in the photo of a previous {{pkmn|Champion}} at the [[Hall of Fame]], despite being a [[Generation II]] Pokémon.

==In the manga==
[[File:Sham Slowking.png|thumb|200px|Slowking in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===Movie adaptations===
{{main|Slowking (M02)}}
Slowking appeared in {{OBP|Pokémon the Movie 2000|graphic novel|the graphic novel adaptation}} of ''[[M02|The Power of One]]''.

===Pokémon Adventures===
A hint of Slowking's existence first appeared in ''[[PS083|Bang the Drum, Slowbro]]'', while [[Lorelei]] was musing on {{p|Slowbro}}'s enhanced abilities after it had been bitten by {{p|Shellder}}. She remarked that {{p|Slowpoke}} would likely have further improved abilities if it was bitten on its head.

Slowking physically debuted in ''[[PS153|Oh, It's Ho-Oh!]]'', under the ownership of [[Sham]]. It was able to use its {{m|Snore}} alongside [[Carl]]'s {{p|Magcargo}} to attack even when asleep. However, a double {{m|Giga Drain}} defeated them both.

A Slowking appeared in ''[[PS179|The Last Battle XIII]]'' as one of the Pokémon sent to participate in the fight in [[Ilex Forest]].

A Slowking appeared under the ownership of Lorelei in ''[[PS277|Enter The Three Beasts]]'', and was used to escape the [[Icefall Cave]] when [[Carr]] detonated his {{p|Forretress}}, as well as to battle [[Sird]].

A Slowking appeared at the {{gdis|Battle Factory|IV}} in ''[[PS427|Uprooting Seedot]]''.

In''[[PS431|The Final Dimensional Duel I]]'', [[Charon]] was seen in possession of a Slowking. It was used to provoke {{p|Giratina}} into attacking {{adv|Pearl}}, and later was used to attack Pearl again when Diamond was supposedly killed. It was later abandoned toward the end of the arc.

In ''[[PS579|Pyroar Breathes]]'', [[Olympia]] used a Slowking to help stop the [[ultimate weapon]] from activating.

===Pokémon Gold & Silver: The Golden Boys===
A talking Slowking appears in ''[[GB19|The Truth About The Mysterious Whirl Islands!!]]''. It met Gold and Chris when they got stranded on Whirl Islands. It initially thought they came to challenge {{p|Lugia}}, but they knew nothing about the [[Silver Wing]]. It asked them to leave but the trees were too thick to cut and build a raft. It then offered to give them its rubber boat if they defeated a recently gone violent {{p|Blastoise}} that had ruled the island for a century. They manage to defeat it, wrecking Slowking's cave in the process. It later explains to them about Lugia and the Whirl Islands after they defeat Lugia.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Slowking (TCG)}}

==Trivia==
* In the TCG, Slowking's {{TCG|Southern Islands}} card is the only card depicting a {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced after [[Generation I]] to have a square Evolution box in Japan only. In the English version, the Southern Islands collection used the Neo-era designs, which, like all later card layouts, feature a circular Evolution box.
* Johtonian Slowking shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Pyroar}}. They are both known as the Royal Pokémon.
* Slowking's [[Pokédex entry|Pokédex entries]] state that if the Shellder is removed, it will revert to a {{p|Slowpoke}}. This is a rare example of [[devolution]] being mentioned in the games.
* Slowking, its Galarian form, and their evolutionary relatives are the only {{type|Psychic}} Pokémon in the {{egg3|Monster}}.
* Galarian Slowking's English {{pkmn|category}}, "Hexpert", may be a combination of ''hex'' and ''expert''.
* In [[Generation IX]], prior to the Version 2.0.1 update of {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, both forms of Slowking were unable to learn {{m|Helping Hand}} via [[TM]], while their pre-Evolutions could, and Galarian Slowking was unable to learn {{m|Snowscape}} via [[TM]] as well, while its pre-Evolution could.
* Due to a glitch, Galarian Slowking transferred from {{g|GO}} to {{g|HOME}} using the [[GO Transporter]] gained {{a|Unseen Fist}} from June 11 to December 14, 2022. This glitch was subsequently resolved and any Slowking in or deposited into HOME with Unseen Fist will have their Ability corrected to {{a|Curious Medicine}}.<ref>https://x.com/mattyoukhana_/status/1535722945175248896</ref>
* Galarian Slowking and its evolutionary relative, Galarian {{p|Slowbro}}, are the only {{DL|List of Pokémon by color|pink}} {{type|Poison}} Pokémon.

===Origin===
{{bulbanews|On the Origin of Species: Slowpoke, Slowbro and Slowking}}
Slowking's physical appearance may be based on {{wp|hippopotamus}}es, {{wp|giant otter}}s, and {{wp|giant salamander}}s. Its shell may reference {{wp|hermit crab}}s and the mythical {{wp|sazae-oni}}, a magical sea demon of Japanese folklore distinguished by its {{wp|Turbo sazae|spiny turban snail shell}}.

As its name suggests, Slowking may also be based on a king, as the growth around its neck resembles a king's {{wp|Ruff (clothing)|ruff}}, while the shell is similar to a crown. Furthermore, due to Slowking's superb intelligence, it may also be based on stereotypical depictions of a {{wp|guru}} wearing a {{wp|turban}} (likely a reference to {{wp|Turbinidae|turban snails}}), with the red stone acting as a {{wp|sarpech}}.

By contrast, Galarian Slowking may draw inspiration from popular depictions of mythical sorcerers or {{wp|warlock}}s: its crown has morphed into a sorcerer's pointed hat, its elongated ruff now resembles a long dark robe, and it has developed a predilection for "{{m|Eerie Spell|chanting mysterious spells}}" in battle. Its {{t|Poison}} type might draw inspiration from {{wp|cone snail}}s, which have cone-shaped shells and are highly venomous. 

====Name origin====
Slowking may be a combination of ''slow'' and ''king''.

Yadoking may be a combination of 宿借り ''yadokari'' ({{wp|hermit crab}}), 宿主 ''yadonushi'' (parasitic host), and ''king''. Like [[Slowbro]], it is also partially named after the famous {{wp|Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian}} singer-songwriter {{wp|Jadranka Stojaković}}, who had worked for {{wp|Konami}} during her residence in Japan. Her name is transliterated into Japanese as ヤドランカ ''Yadoranka'', which inspired one of her former colleagues who named Slowbro and Slowking.<ref>[https://radiosarajevo.ba/metromahala/lica/jadranka-stojakovic-vratila-sam-se-definitivno/54320 Jadranka Stojaković: Vratila sam se definitivno / Radio Sarajevo] ''in Bosnian''</ref>
