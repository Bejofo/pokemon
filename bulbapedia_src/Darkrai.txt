'''Darkrai''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ダークライ''' ''Darkrai'') is a {{type|Dark}} [[Mythical Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation IV]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

It was officially revealed in February 2007.

It is a member of the [[lunar duo]] with {{p|Cresselia}}.

Darkrai is the last Pokémon in the [[List of Pokémon by Hisui Pokédex number|Hisui Pokédex]].

==Biology==
[[File:Darkrai legs.png|thumb|left|250px|Darkrai's extendable stilt-like appendages]]
Darkrai is a black, shadow-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. It has a small head with a white fog-like ghostly plume billowing from its head covering one of its bright blue eyes, with the portion on its face resembling hair. It also has a red spiky growth around its neck. It has skinny arms and long black tatters hanging from its shoulders. It also has black, claw-like hands. It has the slight appearance of an hourglass figure and appears to be wearing an old, ripped cloak. It normally does not have any sort of legs, but it is able to extend stilt-like appendages in their place. In self-defense, Darkrai can retract its head and white "plume" into the pit atop its torso fringed by the aforementioned red growth.

Darkrai is known to "inhabit" dreams and causes the target to have unending nightmares, which can be stopped if exposed to a [[Lunar Feather]] from {{p|Cresselia}}. However, the "unleashing of nightmares" is actually a defense mechanism, instead of an intentionally malicious act. Darkrai is capable of flying at high speeds, and it can become a shadow in order to escape danger or contact with humans. It is also capable of some human speech, and can manifest {{m|Shadow Ball|dark energy}} for offensive purposes. However, in ''[[M10|The Rise of Darkrai]]'', it was shown that its power was weaker than that of {{p|Dialga}} and {{p|Palkia}}. Its relationship to its counterpart, Cresselia, can vary between individuals and [[canon]]s, with some being antagonistic, as seen ''[[DP104|Sleepless In Pre-Battle!]]'' and [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Darkness|Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time, Darkness]], and [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky|Sky]], or cooperative, as seen in ''[[JN074|Nightfall? Nightmares!]]'' and ''[[JN075|A Midsummer Night's Light!]]''. As seen in ''Sleepless In Pre-Battle!'', Darkrai does not only cause nightmares; it is also attracted to them. It can also go around objects it is attracted to several times, as seen in the mentioned episode and [[Pokémon Ranger: Shadows of Almia]]. Shadows of Almia also reveal Darkrai can use an ability called ''Dark Power'' to either trap humans or Pokémon in a ''Dark Void'' dimension of total darkness or teleport them to another location. 

Darkrai is said to be active on nights of the new moon. Darkrai possibly feeds off dreams, characterized by its association with never-ending nightmares. As mentioned in the [[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]], Darkrai has attempted to use Dark Void while it is asleep. It is theorized that Darkrai performs this move because it cannot contain its overflowing power. Darkrai  has three different sleep styles it sleeps in: ''Floaty Arms-Crossed Sleep'', ''Floaty-Stance Sleep'', and ''Dark Void Sleep''. Darkrai can be lured through a combination of Event Drowsy Power and Cresselia. The Eureka Seed can bring out the full power of Darkrai. Darkrai has been observed slumbering during the day of New Moon.

Darkrai is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning and using the move {{m|Dark Void}}. It is also the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Bad Dreams}} as an [[Ability]].

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
{{spoilers}}
* {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}}: {{mdc|Darkrai|2}} is revealed to be the main antagonist of the game in the post-game story. He wants to cover the world in darkness, and was behind the collapse of the [[Temporal Tower]] and {{p|Dialga}}'s corruption into [[Primal Dialga]] in the main storyline of the game. His interference is also the reason the player was separated from {{mdc|Grovyle|2}} and turned into a Pokémon. In the post-game story, he turns his attention to distorting the fabric of space to cover the world in darkness.
* [[PokéPark 2: Wonders Beyond]]: Darkrai is the main antagonist in the game. He resided in [[Wish Park]] and wants to merge the Wish Park with PokéPark. When the Dark Vortex threatens to destroy both [[dimension]]s, Darkrai sacrifices himself to stop it, but is later brought back by {{p|Reshiram}} and {{p|Zekrom}} during the post-game.
* [[Pokémon Ranger: Shadows of Almia]]: Darkrai is the final boss, summoned by [[Blake Hall]].

==In animation==
===Main series===
[[File:Darkrai anime.png|thumb|250px|Darkrai in {{aniseries|JN}}]]
====Major appearances====
=====[[Darkrai (M10)]]=====
Darkrai debuted in ''[[M10|The Rise of Darkrai]]'' as a protagonist. It took the task of holding off the fighting between {{mov|Dialga}} and {{mov|Palkia}} until {{Ash}} and {{an|Dawn}} could put the [[Oración]] disk in the [[Space-Time Towers]] music player to calm the two [[Legendary Pokémon]] down. It reappeared in a cameo in the ending credits of ''[[M12|Arceus and the Jewel of Life]]''.

====Darkrai (recurring)====
A Darkrai appeared in ''[[JN074|Nightfall? Nightmares!]]'' and ''[[JN075|A Midsummer Night's Light!]]'', where it was a target of [[Matori]] and the [[Matori Matrix]], along with {{OBP|Cresselia|recurring}}.

Darkrai's known moves are {{m|Dark Pulse}} and {{m|Dark Void}}, and its Ability is {{a|Bad Dreams}}.

=====Other=====
Darkrai made its animated series debut in ''[[DP104|Sleepless In Pre-Battle!]]''. Unlike the Darkrai in ''The Rise of Darkrai'', this Darkrai was maliciously causing nightmares, much like the one in the {{pkmn|games}}. According to [[Officer Jenny]], it comes at a certain time every year. In the episode, however, it came earlier due to it being lured out by {{TRT}}'s machine, which was also causing nightmares. Cresselia is normally in the same place as Darkrai to stop it from giving nightmares, but due to Darkrai's early arrival, the people in [[Canalave City]] had nightmares for several days. One night, it was concealing itself when {{p|Cresselia}} used its abilities to reveal it from the darkness. The two then battled and Darkrai hid itself once more in the shadows.

In ''[[DP183|League Unleashed!]]'', a mysterious {{pkmn|Trainer}} competed in the [[Lily of the Valley Conference]] with a Darkrai. In [[DP184|the following episode]], [[Conway]] revealed that the Trainer, {{si|Tobias}}, had easily defeated eight [[Gym Leader]]s of the [[Sinnoh]] [[region]] using only Darkrai. In the [[Sinnoh League]] semifinals, this Darkrai was used against Ash, where it easily defeated {{AP|Heracross}}, {{AP|Torkoal}}, and {{AP|Gible}}. However, it was defeated by [[Ash's Sceptile]] in ''[[DP189|The Semi-Final Frontier!]]''.

In ''[[PK26|Pikachu, What's This Key?]]'', {{MTR}}, {{TP|Jessie|Wobbuffet}}, and {{TP|James|Inkay}} visited a Darkrai courtesy of {{p|Klefki}}'s keys. Darkrai scared them out of a dark world in which it resided.

In ''[[XY098|Dream a Little Dream from Me!]]'', a Darkrai was the source of {{AP|Pikachu}}, Meowth, and [[Squishy]]'s nightmare. Darkrai eventually left as soon as it was spotted by Ash and his friends.

====Minor appearances====
A Darkrai appeared in the opening sequence of ''[[M19|Volcanion and the Mechanical Marvel]]''.

====Pokédex entries====

When {{adv|Mewtwo}}'s attack collided with the beam, it caused {{adv|Red}}, {{adv|Blue}}, {{adv|Green}}, {{adv|Yellow}}, and {{adv|Silver}} to turn to stone. In ''[[PS414|Double Trouble with Dialga and Palkia IV]]'', the beam was revealed to have been Darkrai. In ''[[PS438|The Final Dimensional Duel VIII]]'', Sird was revealed to have {{pkmn2|released}} it into the [[Distortion World]], where it clashed with [[Palmer]]'s {{p|Cresselia}} and was briefly controlled by [[Charon]]. After escaping from {{p|Giratina}}'s realm, it left to parts unknown.

'''PAl''': ''A Pokémon shrouded in mystery, Darkrai has the ability to implant nightmares into the minds of both humans and Pokémon. It has legs, but seems to prefer to float in the air.

==Trivia==
* Darkrai's [[Effort values|effort value]] [[List of Pokémon by effort value yield|yield]] of 2 {{stat|Special Attack}} and 1 {{stat|Speed}} is unique.
* Darkrai has two different portrait pictures in both {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}}, and {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky}}.
* Sailor [[Eldritch]]'s son says ''"<sc>Dar... Dark...</sc> Is watching me..."'' in his sleep before the {{player}} cures his nightmare. It is assumed that he is talking about Darkrai, as it is known to give its victims horrific nightmares.
* In the early Japanese versions of {{2v2|Diamond|Pearl}}, Darkrai can be caught with the [[Surf glitch]]. However, this glitch was fixed in other language versions. [[Tweaking|Another glitch]] has been discovered that allows players of other language releases to reach Darkrai without the Member Card.
** This has been remedied in {{game|Platinum}}, however, as Darkrai itself will not appear on the island without the event ticket.
* Darkrai was designed by [[Hironobu Yoshida]].<ref>[https://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/worlds/2014/info/vips/ 2014 Pokémon World Championships VIPs | The Official Pokémon Website]</ref>
* In {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}} and {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky}}, as well as {{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}}, Darkrai is the only non-Ghost type Pokémon capable of traveling through walls and all other terrain types without the All-Terrain Hiker IQ skill.
* Despite being a gender-unknown Pokémon, the {{mdc|Darkrai|2}} in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time, Explorers of Darkness, and Explorers of Sky is referred to as a male.

===Origin===
Darkrai appears to be the personification of {{wp|nightmare}}s, bearing resemblance to folklore creatures such as the {{wp|mare (folklore)|mare}} and other {{wp|night hag}}s. Similarly, some types of {{wp|jinn}}s are also associated with nightmares and {{wp|sleep paralysis}}. It may also draw some inspiration from sleep deities and/or personifications, such as {{wp|Morpheus}}.

Darkrai's appearance is that of a {{wp|ghost}}ly {{wp|shadow person|shadow}}, likely inspired by some popular descriptions of {{wp|bogeyman}} as a dark and formless figure. It may also be inspired by common hallucinations of shadowy figures during sleep paralysis episodes. In contrast to its counterpart Cresselia's association with the crescent moon, Darkrai also appears to represent the {{wp|new moon}}.

Darkrai shares some similarities with the {{wp|nocnitsa}} from Slavic folklore, a type of evil spirit that often torments children with nightmares, gradually draining their life energy. Its physical appearance has many distinct depictions, some of which strongly resemble Darkrai—the most notable ones being: disheveled white hair, a body made out of shadows, and the absence of legs. Furthermore, in some regions it's said the nocnitsa can be stopped if one possesses a knife or a stone with a hole, similar to how a [[Lunar Feather]] can dispel Darkrai's nightmares.

Given its fabric-like texture in {{g|Scarlet and Violet}} and long and stilt-like legs, Darkrai appears to be inspired by a {{wp|scarecrow}}, forming a contrast to {{p|Cresselia}}'s bird-like design.

The black markings around its eyes could be seen to resemble eyebags, which could be caused by a lack of sleep resulting from nightmares.

====Name origin====
Darkrai may be a combination of ''dark'' and 暗い ''kurai'' (dark).
