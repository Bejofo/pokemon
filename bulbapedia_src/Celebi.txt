'''Celebi''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''セレビィ''' ''Celebi'') is a dual-type {{2t|Psychic|Grass}} [[Mythical Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation II]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

It serves as the guardian of [[Ilex Forest]].

Celebi was officially revealed in the July 2000 issue of [[CoroCoro]].<ref>https://www.zoidsland.com/1rebyu-/koro-00-7.html</ref>

Celebi is the last Pokémon in the [[List of Pokémon by Johto Pokédex number|Johto Pokédex]] and [[List of Pokémon by Hoenn Pokédex number in Generation III|Hoenn Pokédex]] in [[Generation III]], although in the latter, Celebi is not shown.

==Biology==
[[File:Celebi temporal anomaly vision.png|left|thumb|250px|Celebi sensing a temporal anomaly (from Celebi's perspective)]]
Celebi is a green, {{wp|fairy}}-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. It has round toeless feet, three-fingered hands, and clear wings on its back. It has a round head that comes to a curved point. It has large baby-blue eyes with thick black rings around them, and a pair of green antennae with blue tips.

Often found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Forest Pokémon|forests}}, Celebi is a Mythical Pokémon, known in legend as the "Voice of the Forest." It is able to [[Time travel|travel through time]] and exist simultaneously throughout time, and plant life flourishes wherever it has been. As seen in ''[[M04|Celebi: The Voice of the Forest]]'', said plant life is able to heal Celebi when it is dying and restore the flora around it to perfect health. Celebi also has the ability to heal wounds, and can release a telekinetic energy wave to defend itself. It was shown in [[Pokémon Colosseum]] that Celebi has the power to instantly cause the [[Purification]] of any [[Shadow Pokémon]] and can be summoned at [[Relic Stone|Relic Forest]] with the melody of a [[Time Flute]].

Despite living in forests as its guardian, Celebi only shows itself in areas and times of peace. It has been regarded that as long as Celebi are seen throughout the world, a prosperous and bright future is still in store for the Pokémon world. As depicted in ''[[SM125|A Timeless Encounter!]]'', Celebi can sense if something is a temporal anomaly in the current timeline and will bring them back to their original timeline. Celebi has been referred to as a forest deity.

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
{{spoilers}}
* [[Pokémon Colosseum]]: Celebi has a connection with the [[Relic Stone]] in [[Agate Village]], which holds the power to [[Purification|purify]] [[Shadow Pokémon]]. Playing a [[Time Flute]] at the Relic Stone can briefly summon Celebi to directly purify any single Shadow Pokémon, regardless of the status of its [[Heart Gauge]].
* {{vg|Pokémon Ranger}}: Celebi is in a [[Ranger Net]] mission. In the mission, the {{player}} must capture the Celebi to save it from the [[Go-Rock Squad]]. It is found wandering in [[Lyra Forest]].
* [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness]]: A [[Celebi (Explorers of Time, Darkness, and Sky)|Shiny Celebi]] is a supporting protagonist in the main storyline. When the player and partner are sent to the future by {{mdc|Dusknoir|2}}, the player, partner, and {{mdc|Grovyle|2}} work together to get back to the past. Celebi was the Pokémon who sent Grovyle and the player to the past before, and the trio receive her help to go back again.
* [[Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs]]: Celebi is the first boss of the game and a main Pokémon in the storyline. It has the power to [[time travel]] and can send the player (without the [[Ukulele Pichu]]) into the past. It can also send specific Pokémon to the present if the player uses the correct [[Ranger Signs]].
* [[Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon]]: A Celebi appears as an ally to {{mdc|Ampharos|smd}} and {{p|Jirachi}} of the [[Expedition Society]], researching the past to find out information about the [[Dark Matter]] and the previous battle against it. Celebi also assists the player and partner in reaching the [[Tree of Life]] at the end of the [[Road to Primeval Forest]].

===Pokédex entries===
In the Japanese version of {{game|Crystal}}, Celebi's [[Pokédex entry]] states: "もりのかみさま として まつられる" (''worshipped as a deity of the forest''). This was adapted in English as "revered as a guardian of the forest".

[[File:Shiny Celebi anime.png|thumb|250px|{{Shiny}} Celebi in ''[[M23|Secrets of the Jungle]]'']]
===Major appearances===
====[[Celebi (M04)]]====
Celebi debuted in ''[[M04|Celebi: The Voice of the Forest]]''. In the beginning, a {{OBP|Pokémon poacher|M04}} was after a it, and it traveled 40 years into the future to escape from him, taking [[Sam]] along with it by accident. The [[Iron-Masked Marauder]] eventually {{pkmn2|caught}} the Time Travel Pokémon in a [[Dark Ball]] and used it to destroy the forest. However, {{Ash}} and Sam managed to snap Celebi out of the Iron-Masked Marauder's spell.

====[[Celebi (M13)]]====
In ''[[M13|Zoroark: Master of Illusions]]'', [[Grings Kodai]] was after Celebi's [[Time Ripple]] in order to restore his ability to see the future, which he got on a previous encounter with it. It befriended {{OBP|Zorua|M13}} and helped save {{OBP|Zoroark|M13}} after she was mortally injured by Kodai.

====Celebi (recurring)====
In ''[[SM125|A Timeless Encounter!]]'', a Celebi was disturbed by the {{pkmn|battle}} between [[Ash's Lycanroc]] and {{AP|Torracat}}. In response, it accidentally caused Ash and Torracat to travel back to the past. Later, Celebi transported them back to the present, which was seen again in ''[[SM126|Pikachu's Exciting Adventure!]]'' from the perspective of Ash's other Pokémon.

====Other====
Celebi made its TV debut in ''[[HS13|Celebi and Joy!]]'', where it took [[Ritchie]] back in time to help him prevent the demolition of a [[Pokémon Center]].

Celebi made its animated series debut in ''[[AG155|The Green Guardian]]'', where [[Solana]] assisted {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} in helping one.

A {{Shiny}} Celebi appeared in ''[[M23|Secrets of the Jungle]]'', as the Guardian of [[Forest of Okoya]]. It was not seen in the jungle for a long time, only returning when [[Dada|a Zarude]] rejoined its tribe.

===Minor appearances===
In the opening sequence of ''[[M06|Jirachi: Wish Maker]]'', a Celebi was flying over a lake.

A Celebi appeared in [[PK14]].

{{spoilers}}
Celebi made its debut in ''[[PS175|The Last Battle IX]]''. The [[Masked Man]] aimed to catch it and use its time-traveling powers to reunite {{p|Lapras|one of his Pokémon}} with its deceased parents. Although the Masked Man managed to catch Celebi, the [[GS Ball]] holding it was destroyed by {{adv|Gold}}, freeing it from the villain's control.

In ''[[PS267|It All Ends Now VIII]]'', Celebi was revealed to have chosen {{adv|Ruby}} as its new Trainer before he moved from [[Johto]] to [[Hoenn]], though Ruby had no idea of how rare of a Pokémon it was. Remaining unseen for almost the entire {{MangaArc|Ruby & Sapphire}}, it appeared at the end of the arc to destroy the [[Colored orbs|Red and Blue Orbs]] and revive {{Steven}}, [[Norman]], and [[Courtney]], who had died during the conflict involving {{p|Groudon}} and {{p|Kyogre}}, before returning to the wild.

In the {{MangaArc|HeartGold & SoulSilver}}, Celebi agreed to cure {{adv|Giovanni}} of his long-time illness in exchange for him helping to prevent the destruction of the [[Sinjoh Ruins]].

===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]===
When a {{i|Poké Ball}} is thrown, there is a 1 in 251 chance of Celebi appearing after all these requirements have been fulfilled:
* Unlock all 25 characters
* Unlock all 29 stages
* Beat all 51 events
* Unlock the score display (by reaching 5000 KOs)

It does not affect the battle, but the thrower of the Poké Ball will earn a bonus and trophy of Celebi.

====Trophy information====
''"Celebi has the power to travel through time, and thus wanders from one age to the next. It is considered a deity by the forests: plants and trees are said to grow in unimaginable abundance wherever Celebi visits. Like Mew, Celebi is a Pokémon shrouded in mystery. Its special techniques blend grass and psychic powers."''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]===
When a Poké Ball is thrown, there is a 1 in 493 chance of Celebi appearing. Like the other "secret" Pokémon, it drops collectible items; in Celebi's case, it drops trophies.

====Trophy information====
''"A Time Travel Pokémon. Celebi can travel throughout time and inhabit multiple places simultaneously. It is said that it appears only during times of peace, greeted by a flourishing of grass and trees. Two turns after Celebi uses its {{m|Future Sight}} move, the foe is bombarded with psychic energy. This proves to have a devastating impact on any Pokémon."''

Celebi appears as a trophy in the 3DS version only.

====Trophy information====
''This Pokémon has the unique ability to travel through time to the past or future. However, the only times Celebi wants to visit are those of peace, so catching sight of Celebi in one of the beautiful forests it frequents is a good sign indeed. Perhaps it's mankind's responsibility to create the kind of time Celebi would want to visit.''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Celebi appears as a {{sbw|Spirits (characters)|Spirit}}.

==Trivia==
* According to a now-dead Nintendo of Japan page from the early 2000s, Celebi's Japanese name was initially romanized as ''Selbi'' as opposed to the later ''Celebi''.<ref>[http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n07/selbi/ Nintendo of Japan page]{{dead link}}</ref><ref>[http://www.math.miami.edu/~jam/azure/forum/tuff/ultimatebb.php?ubb=get_topic;f=7;t=001003 The Azure Heights Forum: How to get Serebii] (thread from March 2001, containing a link to the aforementioned Nintendo of Japan page)</ref>
* After {{p|Deoxys}}, Celebi is the second [[Mythical Pokémon]] to become legitimately available in-game without any sort of event or distribution, this time in the [[Virtual Console]] release of {{game|Crystal}} on the [[Nintendo 3DS]].
* Celebi is the only Pokémon of the 100 introduced in [[Generation II]] that wasn't used in [[Pokérap GS]].
** However, it was used in the [[Hoenn Pokérap]] along with {{p|Mew}}, another Pokémon that wasn't used in [[Kanto Pokérap|its own generation's Pokérap]].
* The {{Shiny}} {{mdc|Celebi|2}} in {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}} is referred to as a female during the story, although it is gender unknown for gameplay purposes.
** Also, this Celebi is the first [[Shiny Pokémon]] to appear in the [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series]].
** A different non-Shiny Celebi appears in {{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}}, who is referred to as a male.
** In [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX]], Celebi is the only obtainable Shiny Pokémon that does not appear as a Strong Foe; it is instead found in a Mystery House.
* Celebi is the only Mythical Pokémon introduced in Generation II.
* A 2008 [http://www.pokebeach.com/news/0708/second-pokemon-interview-with-masamitsu-hidaka-many-interesting-points interview] done with [[Masamitsu Hidaka]] revealed that the [[GS Ball]] was initially meant to contain a Celebi that would be used in a story arc throughout the Johto series. This idea was shelved, however, when {{OBP|Celebi|M04}} was decided to be the star of ''[[M04|Celebi: The Voice of the Forest]]''.
* Celebi is the only Pokémon whose number in the [[National Pokédex]] and the [[List of Pokémon by New Pokédex number|New Pokédex]] are the same: 251.
* Celebi was the first event-exclusive Pokémon to appear in the {{pkmn|animated series}} outside of a {{pkmn|movie}}.

===Concept and development===
Celebi was designed by [[Hironobu Yoshida]].<ref>[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20080704081535/http://www.gpara.com/contents/creator/bn_225.htm Drill Dozer interview by Gpara] (Japanese)</ref><ref>[https://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/worlds/2014/info/vips/ 2014 Pokémon World Championships VIPs | The Official Pokémon Website]</ref>

===Origin===
Celebi has a natural theme.<ref>[https://www.gamefreak.co.jp/blog/dir_english/2010/07/index.html "HIDDEN POWER of masuda" Director's Columns, No.164] (July 12, 2010)</ref> Specifically, it might be related to the natural worship of {{wp|Shinto}}ism. It also may be based on a {{wp|fairy}}, {{wp|dryad}}, or {{wp|Kodama (spirit)|kodama}}, mixed with a plant {{wp|bulb}}.

Celebi's beta designs, and to a lesser extent its final design, appear to draw inspiration from {{wp|Kokopelli}}, a god of fertility and music from the cultures of some southwestern Native American peoples.

====Name origin====
Celebi may be a combination of 精霊 ''seirei'' (spirit), ''{{wp|Ceres (mythology)|Ceres}}'' (Roman goddess of fertility), ''celebrate'' or ''celestial'', ''serenity'', and 美 ''bi'' (beauty) or ''being''.
