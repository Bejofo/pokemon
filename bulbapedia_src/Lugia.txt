'''Lugia''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ルギア''' ''Lugia'') is a dual-type {{2t|Psychic|Flying}} {{pkmn2|Legendary}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation II]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

Lugia is the [[game mascot]] of {{game|Gold and Silver|s|Pokémon Silver}}, its remake {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s|Pokémon SoulSilver}}, and [[Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness]], appearing on the boxart of them all.

Lugia and {{p|Ho-Oh}} are often collectively referred to as the [[tower duo]] by fans. It is also often viewed as the [[Legendary leader|leader]] of the [[legendary birds]] due to its role in the {{pkmn|movie}} ''[[M02|The Power of One]]'' and in the {{pkmn|Mystery Dungeon series}}.
	
Lugia has a unique {{pkmn2|variant}} called '''[[Shadow Lugia]]''', codenamed '''XD001''', that appeared in Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness.

==Biology==
[[File:Lugia plates.png|thumb|left|250px|Lugia folding back its plates]]
Lugia is a large {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that resembles a {{wp|dragon}}, a plesiosaur, and a bird. It is primarily silver-white, but it has blue undersides with slightly varying tones. It has a ridged mouth similar to a beak, although it has pointed teeth on its lower jaw. Its head has a point to the back, and Lugia's eyes have pointed blue or black spikes on them. Lugia has a long, slender neck and a smooth, streamlined body. Dark blue or black plate-like protrusions run down the length of its back, and there are two smaller, more pointed ones on the end of its tail. It has large wings that resemble hands.

Lugia can fold back these plates to increase its speed. Though it is gender unknown, as depicted in ''[[EP220|The Mystery is History]]'', [[Silver (Lugia)|a young Lugia]] has been seen, suggesting there is a breeding population, at least in the [[Timeline of events in Pokémon the Series: Gold and Silver|animated series timeline]]. In the same episode, Lugia has been shown to be fiercely protective of its young, which also eat kelp. In the [[M02|second Pokémon movie]], Lugia leads the [[legendary birds]] and when they fight over territory, Lugia is the only Pokémon that can quell their ceaseless fighting, but cannot do so without a partner. Much like the birds, it possesses the ability to control the weather; most notably, it can calm and give rise to storms. 

It is said that a light flutter of its wings is capable of causing winds powerful enough to tear a regular house down. If it were to flap its wings, it could hypothetically spawn storms lasting as long as forty days. Lugia is capable of splitting islands into smaller islands. When attacking, it is capable of {{m|Aeroblast|shooting a vortex of air at its target}} and using psychic power. It is highly intelligent, and because of the devastating power it could accidentally inflict, it isolates itself deep underwater and tends to sleep in solitude. It is extremely {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Rare Pokémon|rare}} and is hardly ever seen. In ancient times, the former [[Burned Tower|Brass Tower]] in [[Ecruteak City]] was once Lugia's perch. However, after its destruction 150 years ago, Lugia moved to the [[Whirl Islands]] for the safety of others from its own power. It can be summoned at the Whirl Island through [[Silver Feather|one of its feathers]], [[Tidal Bell|Tidal Bells]], and the dance of the [[Kimono Girl|Kimono Girls]]. Lugia had many different titles throughout the years as the "'''guardian of the seas'''", ''deity of the sea'', "beast of the sea", "mythical sea creature", and "vengeance deity".<ref>''"It’s all but impossible to tell where the stormy skies end and where the roiling water begins as the Diving Pokémon breaches the surface of the water with all the power and terror of a vengeance deity."'' - [https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/art-of-the-pokemon-tcg-sword-shield-silver-tempest-expansion Art of the Pokémon TCG: Sword & Shield—Silver Tempest Expansion] on [[Pokémon.com]]</ref>. There are rumors Lugia would appear during the night of a storm. Lugia loves [[Lugia Treat]]s made by [[Snacksworth]], who once encountered it in the past.

Lugia is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Aeroblast}}.

;Shadow Lugia
'''Shadow Lugia''' is the first and only XD-series [[Shadow Pokémon]] created by [[Lovrina]] of [[Cipher]]. It has jagged silver eye-spikes, a dark-purple body with white undersides, and glowing red eyes. It also has sharper toes that resemble claws, as well as a longer, more pointed tongue. Additionally, due to the shape of Lugia's back plates on its 3D models being changed after [[Generation IV]], Shadow Lugia now possesses a unique design for them. 

Shadow Lugia is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Shadow Blast}}.

Lugia debuted in ''[[M02|The Power of One]]'', where it was central to the legend of [[Shamouti Island]]. It can communicate with humans [[Talking Pokémon|through telepathy]].

=====[[Lugia (Silver's parent)]]=====
Lugia made its animated series debut in ''[[EP210|Around the Whirlpool]]'', where a silhouetted Lugia saved {{Ash}}, {{an|Misty}}, and {{an|Brock}} from being sucked into a whirlpool. It later turned out to be {{OBP|Silver|Lugia}}'s parent in ''[[EP220|The Mystery is History]]''.

====={{OBP|Silver|Lugia}}=====
A young Lugia, [[nickname]]d Silver by {{jo|Oliver}}, lived near [[Ogi Isle]] in the [[Whirl Islands]]. [[Dr. Namba]] attempted to capture both the parent Lugia and Silver for {{an|Giovanni}} in ''The Mystery is History'', ''[[EP221|A Parent Trapped!]]'', and ''[[EP222|A Promise is a Promise]]''.

Metapod?!]]'', the Kanto [[Elite Four]] tried to exterminate humans using Lugia, which appeared as a spirit above [[Cerise Island]] in response to the energy produced by [[Badge|Gym Badges]].

==Other appearances==
[[File:Lugia SSBB.png|thumb|250px|Lugia in [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]]]
===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]/[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl|Brawl]]/[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U|3DS/Wii U]]/[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate|Ultimate]]===
When released from a {{i|Poké Ball}}, Lugia will fly up out of the stage and return in the background, where it unleashes a powerful {{m|Aeroblast}} on a section of the stage.

====Melee trophy information====
''The waters of the [[Whirl Islands]] are home to this legendary Pokémon, whom very few have seen. Lugia live quietly in the deepest ocean trenches for one very good reason: its combined aerial and psychic powers are so strong as to be extremely dangerous. The special moves of this gargantuan creature include the destructive wind assault known as Aeroblast.''

====Brawl trophy information====
''"A Diving Pokémon. A legendary Pokémon often referred to as 'guardian of the seas,' it has the impressive ability to control the wind. Lugia typically spends its time quietly at the bottom of the ocean. Highly powerful in all areas, Lugia's Aeroblast move is especially powerful. It uses strong flapping of its wings to target damage on a foe's weak spot."''

====3DS/Wii U trophy information====
[[File:Lugia 3DS trophy SSB4.png|thumb|150px|Lugia trophy in ''Super Smash Bros. for 3DS'']]
Lugia appears as a trophy in both versions of the game.

'''NA''': ''Despite being a Psychic/Flying-type Pokémon, Lugia sleeps on the ocean floor. Legend says the flapping of Lugia's wings can create storms that last up to 40 days. It's impossible to know for sure, but in Smash Bros., Lugia definitely brings a storm with its Aeroblast attack.''

'''PAL''': ''Despite being a Psychic- and Flying-type, Lugia sleeps on the ocean floor. It's said that if it were to flap its wings on waking up, it could cause a storm lasting 40 days. No one can say whether that's true or not, but Lugia's attacks certainly make it seem so. It flies behind the stage and creates a mighty gust of wind with its Aeroblast attack.''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Lugia returns as Poké Ball summon. It also appears as a {{sbw|Spirit}}.

==Trivia==
[[File:Lugia Red Battle Chess.png|thumb|Lugia in Pokémon Battle Chess]]
<!-- Please do not add trivia referring to the episode of E.R. which mentioned Lugia. That belongs on the page: "List of references to Pokémon in popular culture," not here. -->
* Despite not being a Water type, Lugia has occasionally been depicted as a {{ct|Water}} in the [[Lugia (TCG)|Trading Card Game]].
* Lugia is tied with Ho-Oh for the [[List of Pokémon by base stats|highest base]] {{stat|Special Defense}} stat of all {{type|Flying}} Pokémon.
* Lugia's various Pokédex entries that mention it being able to cause a 40-day storm may be a biblical reference to {{wp|Noah's Ark}}.
* When Lugia's Shiny form is shown in {{g|Stadium 2}}, it is pale green rather than pink.
* Lugia appears in {{DL|Pokémon Battle Chess|Pokémon Battle Chess}}. Alongside Ho-Oh, the player must lose a specific number of pieces (four in Lugia's case) to use it, and it takes four spaces on the board.
[[File:SetSymbolSilver Tempest.png|60px|thumb|Silver Tempest set symbol]]
* Ho-Oh and Lugia are the only Legendary Pokémon that are [[game mascot]]s that are not version-exclusives in their representative games.
* Despite being strongly associated with the sea, Lugia does not appear in the sea at [[Pal Park]].
* The symbol for the {{TCG|Silver Tempest}} expansion resembles Lugia's silhouette.
* Lugia's association with the sea is possibly referenced with its Water [[Terastal phenomenon|Tera Type]] when caught in {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}.

===Concept and development===
[[File:PowerOfOneLugiaConceptArtwork.png|thumb|200px|[[Ken Sugimori]] concept artwork featuring an "X" on Lugia's chest.]]
The initial idea for what would become Lugia was conceptualized by chief writer [[Takeshi Shudo]] while developing the script for [[M02|the second movie]],<ref>[http://www.style.fm/as/05_column/shudo187.shtml シナリオえーだば創作術 第187回]</ref> at the time dubbed "Pokémon X". "Pokémon X" was said to be a "creator of all life on earth" that symbolizes ocean currents. It is thus described as a "maternal Pokémon" in nature. The concept of its gender was a point of fixation for Shudo, initially being "male and female at once." However, Shudo would later insist Lugia was intended to be feminine and expressed severe regret over it not being voiced by a woman in ''The Power of One''.<ref>[http://lavacutcontent.com/takeshi-shudo-ending-pokemon/ Pokemon’s Head Writer: Booze, Pills, and Ending Ash’s Story – Lava Cut Content]</ref>

The role for "Pokémon X" was ultimately filled by Lugia, whose name and design were created by someone else.<ref>[http://www.style.fm/as/05_column/shudo188.shtml シナリオえーだば創作術 第188回]</ref> This would mark several key decisions, such as the choice for it to be voiced by a man, and becoming a guardian of the seas instead of a creator of life. A piece of concept artwork made by [[Ken Sugimori]] for the second movie depicts this intermittent design stage; Lugia is shown with an X-shaped motif on its stomach and only six plates on its back. Remnants of this design stage are also visible in ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'', where [[Dr. Namba]] also refers to Lugia as "Pokémon X" and Lugia is shown to be a doting mother, unlike its [[trio master]]-like appearance in ''The Power of One''.

Lugia was not originally in {{game|Gold and Silver|s}}, being completely absent in the [[Pokémon Gold and Silver Spaceworld '97 demo|1997 Nintendo Space World demo]] of the games. It would, however, be seen in the demo shown at Space World 1999, complete with {{m|Aeroblast}}. Placed into the games, Lugia was made a {{t|Psychic}}-type Pokémon to make a stronger impression, according to [[Shigeki Morimoto]] in Nintendo DREAM's November 2009 issue. This lines up with its stats in the Space World 1999 demo, having its defensive and offensive stats swapped prior to release.<ref>[https://tcrf.net/Development:Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver/Pok%C3%A9mon_Data/Base_Stats#Lugia_and_Ho-Oh The Cutting Room Floor]</ref> Shudo was surprised to see Lugia in the Pokémon {{pkmn|games}}, having expected it to be exclusive to the movie.<ref>[http://www.style.fm/as/05_column/shudo206.shtml シナリオえーだば創作術 第206回]</ref>

Shadow Lugia was designed by [[James Turner]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/JamesTurner_42/status/900861377333542912 Tweet about designing Shadow Lugia]</ref> According to Turner, he chose Shadow Lugia's colors and finalized its design based on sketches drawn by [[Hiromoto-SIN-ichi]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/JamesTurner_42/status/1201041088942723072 Tweet about finalizing the design of Shadow Lugia]</ref>

===Origin===
Lugia's aquatic tendencies could relate it to {{wp|plesiosauria|plesiosaurs}} and aquatic birds. It is also possible that it may be based on {{wp|Ryūjin}}, a dragon who lived on the ocean floor and was the {{wp|Shinto}} god of the sea. In keeping with this, Lugia resembles a {{wp|wyvern}}, a variety of dragons with a single set of forelimbs that serve as wings. Its avian body, coloration, and face-markings suggest that it may be somewhat based on the {{wp|grey heron}}. Its rounded feet resemble those of {{wp|grebes}}, a family of diving birds. The {{wp|beluga whale}}, a white whale with similar body shape and coloration to Lugia, may also be a basis for its design and name. It might also be based on {{wp|Bahamut}} (giant fish), and Bahamut is often being portrayed as a dragon-like creature in modern fantasy, hence its fish-like and dragon-like appearance. Additionally, Lugia's {{Shiny}} form (pink and white) resembles the coral colors of {{wp|Ryūgū-jō|Ryūjin's palace}} (red and white).

====Name origin====
Lugia may be derived from ἄργυρος ''árguros'' (Ancient Greek for silver). It may also involve ''{{wp|Beluga whale|beluga}}'', ''deluge'', ''luna'', and ''Lutīyā'' (early name for the {{wp|Bahamut}}).

XD001 may stand for e'''X'''tra '''D'''imension (Japanese: '''エクストラデイメンジョン'''), the abbreviation used in the title [[Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness]].<ref>[[Media:Pokemon-XD CoroCoro-Scan 02.jpg|June 2005 CoroCoro Comic]]</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050821080405/http://www.nintendo.com/cpp/login/offSiteGetProfile.do?rDirect=http://www.pokemon-games.com/portal/portal.jsp Pokemon-Games.com] (archive)</ref>
