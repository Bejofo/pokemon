'''Charmander''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ヒトカゲ''' ''Hitokage'') is a {{type|Fire}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Charmeleon}} starting at [[level]] 16, which evolves into {{p|Charizard}} starting at level 36.

Along with {{p|Bulbasaur}} and {{p|Squirtle}}, Charmander is one of the three [[Kanto first partner Pokémon|first partner Pokémon of Kanto]] available at the beginning of [[Pokémon Red and Green Versions|Pokémon Red, Green]], [[Pokémon Red and Blue Versions|Blue]], [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Versions|FireRed, and LeafGreen]].

==Biology==
[[File:Ash Charmander waiting for Damian.png|thumb|left|250px|Charmander protecting the flame on its tail from the rain]]
Charmander is a bipedal, {{wp|reptile|reptilian}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a primarily orange body and blue eyes. Its underside from the chest down and the soles of its feet are cream-colored. It has two small fangs visible in its upper jaw and two smaller fangs in its lower jaw. A fire burns at the tip of this Pokémon's slender tail, which has blazed there since Charmander's birth.

The flame can indicate Charmander's health and mood, burning brightly when the Pokémon is strong, weakly when it is exhausted, wavering when it is happy, and blazing when it is enraged. It is said that Charmander would die if its flame were to go out. However, if the Pokémon is healthy, the flame will continue to burn even if it gets a bit wet and is said to steam in the rain. As shown in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Charmander is known to sleep while curled up.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref> Supposedly, Charmander is drawing warmth from the flame on its tail. During quiet nights, the sounds of its flame can be heard by listening carefully while Charmander sleeps. Charmander has four different sleep styles: ''Crackling Sleep'', ''Tummy-Rub Sleep'', ''Tummy-Up Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''.

Charmander can be found in hot, {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Mountain Pokémon|mountainous areas}}. It has been recently seen living in the [[Terarium]] of [[Blueberry Academy]]. However, it is found far more often in the ownership of {{pkmn|Trainer}}s. As shown in [[Pokémon Snap]] and [[New Pokémon Snap]], Charmander exhibits pack behavior, calling others of its species if it finds food and watching the flames on each other's tails to ensure they don't go out.

===NPC appearances===
* [[PokéPark Wii: Pikachu's Adventure]]: Charmander is one of {{OBP|Pikachu|PokéPark}}'s best friends. After falling through the mysterious tunnel, he almost lands into a pool of molten lava, only to be saved by the [[Lava Zone]] leader, {{p|Blaziken}}, who takes him in as his pupil and trains to become stronger. After he's been found, he journeys to the [[Meeting Place]], where he helps {{p|Piplup}} mend the balloon and makes fireworks. He later accompanies Pikachu to the [[Sky Pavilion]] along with {{p|Piplup}} and {{p|Chikorita}}, where he meets {{p|Mew}}. Once the [[Sky Prism]] has been restored, Charmander celebrates by firing off the fireworks he made.

===Pokémon Adventures===
====Major appearances====
=====[[Blue's Charmander]]=====
Charmander debuted in ''[[PS001|A Glimpse of the Glow]]''. It first appeared in {{adv|Red}}'s fantasy, then as one of {{adv|Blue}}'s first Pokémon, received from his grandfather {{adv|Professor Oak}}. He has since evolved into {{p|Charmeleon}} before facing off against [[Brock]] of [[Pewter City]], and then to {{p|Charizard}} before the [[Silph Co.]] {{pkmn|battle}}s against [[Team Rocket]].

=====[[Salamè]]=====
After {{adv|X}}'s {{p|Chespin}}, [[Marisso]], lost to him in a battle, X decided to take him and named him Salamè in ''[[PS559|Chespin Sows the Seeds of Change]]''. He later evolved into a Charmeleon alongside Marisso, who evolved into a {{p|Quilladin}} in ''[[PS577|Quilladin Stands]]''.

Green's Charmander has evolved into {{p|Charizard}}. It seems to be able to skip the {{p|Charmeleon}} stage, as it was seen evolving directly into Charizard. Although it has devolved back to the Charmander stage, it currently seems to have permanently evolved back into Charizard.

{{OBP|Blue|Ruby-Sapphire}} also owns a Charmander.

===The Electric Tale of Pikachu===
{{main|Ash's Charmander}}
{{OBP|Ash Ketchum|EToP|Ash}}'s Charmander makes a few appearances in [[The Electric Tale of Pikachu]].

Ash is shown to own a Charmander despite this, his own Charmander first appears in ''[[ET08|You Gotta Have Friends]]''. Ash's Charmander's capture is not shown in the manga, instead, when Charmander first appears from its {{i|Poké Ball}}, it is simply stated that "Ash has been busy since the last comic".

Ash's Charmander reappears as a {{p|Charizard}} in the chapter ''[[ET13|The Indigo Finals]]'' at the [[Indigo Plateau Conference]]. In this chapter, Charizard battles [[Zippo|Charley]], [[Ritchie]]'s own Charizard.

====Trophy information====
''"A Lizard Pokémon. It just downright likes hot stuff. The always-burning tail indicates its mood--waving gently when content and burning intensely when angry. If the tail were to go out, it would be the end of Charmander's life. Its tail is believed to emit steam when it rains. Charmander evolves into Charmeleon by leveling up."''

==Trivia==
[[File:Niue Dollar Pokémon.png|thumb|250px|$1 coins from {{wp|Niue}}]]
* Charmander, {{p|Cyndaquil}}, and their respective evolutionary lines have exactly the same base stats in the same distribution.
* {{wp|Niue}} released a one-dollar coin featuring Charmander as part of a commemorative promotion for the [[Pokémon]] franchise, with Charmander on one side and the nation's coat of arms on the other.

===Concept and development===
Charmander and its evolved forms were designed by [[Atsuko Nishida]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19980121112202fw_/http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/POKEMON/INTER/ATSUKO/INTER_AT.HTM Interview with Atsuko Nishida on Game Freak's website] (archived, Japanese)</ref><ref>[https://funs-project.com/poplab/007/index_2.html Fun's Project interview with Atsuko Nishida] (Japanese)</ref>

===Design variations===
In its [[Generation I]] [[#Sprites|sprites]] and original key artwork, Charmander is depicted with a small line of spikes on its back. These spikes are also seen on [[Blue's Charmander]] in the [[Pokémon Adventures]] manga, where the spikes are larger and easier to see, and on [[Green's Charizard|Green's Charmander]] in the [[Pokémon Pocket Monsters]] manga.

Additionally, Charmander is depicted with [[Pokémon controversies#Four-fingered hands|an inconsistent number of fingers]] in its designs. The original sprites designed by [[Atsuko Nishida]] for {{game|Red and Green|s}} featured three fingers, while the artwork [[Ken Sugimori]] drew based on those sprites had four fingers. Currently, the {{pkmn|animated series}}, {{pkmn|movie}}s, and [[List of animated series specials|specials]], as well as artwork unrelated to {{pkmn|games}} and {{pkmn|merchandise}}, use the three-finger design; while the key artwork used since {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}}, as well as the games' 3D models and artwork based on those (such as artwork for {{LGPE}}), feature the four-finger design. The number of fingers used for {{Trading Card Game}} card art often varies between illustrators, and even within a single illustrator's works; compare {{TCG|Boundaries Crossed}} {{TCG ID|Boundaries Crossed|Charmander|18}} and {{TCG|Generations}} {{TCG ID|Generations|Charmander|RC3}}, both illustrated by [[Akira Komayama]].

===Origin===
{{Bulbanews|On the Origin of Species: Charmander}}
Charmander's design was based on Charizard in such a way that it was surprising to see it evolving into the latter Pokémon.<ref name=Origin>[https://web.archive.org/web/20211108083831/https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/creator-profile-the-creators-of-pikachu/ Creator Profile: The Creators of Pikachu - Pokemon.com] (archived)</ref> In particular, Charmander was designed as a {{wp|lizard}}.<ref name=Origin/> Based on its name, Charmander is also based on a {{wp|salamander}}, which are amphibians that physically resemble lizards. {{wp|Cultural depictions of salamanders|In folklore and mythology}}, salamanders are often thought of as fire spirits capable of surviving in extreme heat or flames. As Charizard is based on a {{wp|European dragon}}, Charmander's lizardlike design seems to reference how Western dragons in folklore are heavily inspired by lizards and other reptiles, as well as how various types of lizards are likened to (and named after) dragons due to this connection. Its bipedal design resembles a baby {{wp|theropod}} dinosaur.

====Name origin====
Charmander is a combination of ''char'' (to burn) and ''salamander'', as stated in the January 1999 "POCKEMON JOURNAL" on the official [[Game Freak]] website.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19990221135156/http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/POKEMON/NEWS/NEWS.HTM GAME FREAK | POCKEMON JOURNAL] (archive)</ref> Alternatively, in a 2016 interview with [[Tsunekazu Ishihara]] by INSIDE, Charmander is stated to be a combination of ''{{wp|charcoal}}'' (carbon residue produced by strongly heating wood) and ''{{wp|Salamandra}}'' (a genus of salamander including four species of fire salamander).<ref>(February 27, 2016). "[https://web.archive.org/web/20220928180754/https://www.inside-games.jp/article/2016/02/27/96339_2.html ポケモンが現実世界と仮想世界を繋いでいく、20年目の挑戦・・・株式会社ポケモン代表取締役社長・石原恒和氏インタビュー]" ''inside-games.jp''.</ref>

Hitokage may be a combination of 火 ''hi'' (fire) and 蜥蜴 ''tokage'' (lizard), forming together the word 火蜥蜴 ''hitokage'' (mythical salamander).
