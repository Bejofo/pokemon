'''Qwilfish''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ハリーセン''' ''Harysen'') is a dual-type {{2t|Water|Poison}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation II]].

In [[Hisui]], Qwilfish has a dual-type {{2t|Dark|Poison}} [[regional form]]. It evolves into {{p|Overqwil}} when [[level]]ed up while knowing {{m|Barb Barrage}}. In the modern day, Hisuian Qwilfish can be found in [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]].

Johtonian Qwilfish is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for these details.)

==Biology==
[[File:QwilfishShiningLegends21.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Qwilfish inflating its body]]
Qwilfish is a {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Sea Pokémon|sea dwelling}} {{wp|fish|piscine}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a spherical body and a flat, paddle-shaped tail. The upper half of its body is dark teal and the lower half is light greenish-yellow. Its tail is tall and thin with a dark teal outline, light greenish-yellow inside, and two dark teal dots in the center that resemble the Japanese character ハ ''Ha''. Its eyes are even with its body and are always seen slanted angrily. Below its eyes are its puffy pink lips. All around its body are sharp, conical spikes, which evolved from scales over time.

In order to attack, Qwilfish drinks over 2.6 gallons (10 litres) of water to inflate its body. It then uses the water pressure to shoot poisonous quills at its foe, which can cause fainting. Qwilfish is briefly left defenseless shortly after firing its quills; this is believed by some expert fishers to be the opportune moment to catch this Pokémon. Due to its round body, Qwilfish is not a great swimmer, and when filled with water it is even harder for it to swim. When Qwilfish faces a larger opponent, it will inflate its body to match its size as close as it can. If it is startled while inflated, it will spit out all its water, propelling itself away.

===Forms===
Qwilfish has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Hisuian}} Qwilfish.

In [[Hisui]], its upper half is black, while its lower half is pale yellow. Its body is covered in spikes; the spikes on its upper body have dark purple tips, except for the two spikes on its forehead, which are also smaller in size. Hisuian Qwilfish can spray poison from these spines. There are crescent purple lines underneath Hisuian Qwilfish's eyes, and its lips are also colored purple. Its flat tail has a black outline with a light yellow inside, and a black pattern that resembles the lowercase letter "q". 

Hisuian Qwilfish is despised by the fisherman of the Hisui region, due to its poison wreaking havoc in the seas it lives in. Its poisonous spikes are thicker and shorter than Qwilfish from other regions. This form of Qwilfish absorbs poison from the food it consumes. The purple coloration on its body serves as evidence of its potent poison. In the present day, Hisuian Qwilfish is known to be found offshore in cold parts of the world and in Blueberry Academy, located somewhere in [[Unova]]'s ocean, specifically in the [[Terarium]]'s [[Polar Biome]].

Hisuian Qwilfish and its evolved form, {{p|Overqwil}}, are the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Barb Barrage}}.

===Evolution===
In [[Hisui]], Qwilfish has a [[regional form]] that evolves into {{p|Overqwil}}. Johtonian Qwilfish is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.

Afterwards, she found a baby Qwilfish stuck in the toxic waste; as she prepared to take it to a [[Pokémon Center]], {{DL|Legendary beasts (Adventures)|Suicune}} appeared, healing Qwilfish and purifying the seawater. It is unknown if the Qwilfish are still under Crystal's ownership or were {{pkmn2|released}} afterwards.

A Qwilfish appeared in ''[[PS179|The Last Battle XIII]]'' as one of the Pokémon sent to participate in the fight in [[Ilex Forest]].

===={{MangaArc|Ruby & Sapphire}}====
A Qwilfish was one of the aquarium Pokémon seen in [[Archie]]'s collection in ''[[PS192|Stick This in Your Craw, Crawdaunt! I]]''.

===={{MangaArc|Platinum}}====
Much later, in ''[[PS426|Softening Up Kakuna]]'', ''[[PS427|Uprooting Seedot]]'', and ''[[PS428|Outlasting Ledian]]'', a Qwilfish was one of the Pokémon that {{adv|Platinum}} rented during the {{gdis|Battle Factory|IV}} challenge.

==Trivia==
* Qwilfish shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Igglybuff}}, {{p|Jigglypuff}}, {{p|Wigglytuff}}, and {{p|Drifloon}}. They are all known as the Balloon Pokémon.
* Qwilfish can be seen as a parallel to {{p|Remoraid}}. Both of them are {{type|Water}} {{cat|Generation II Pokémon}}. Qwilfish is exclusive to {{game3|FireRed and LeafGreen|FireRed|s}}, while Remoraid is exclusive to {{game3|FireRed and LeafGreen|LeafGreen|s}}, with both Pokémon found in the same locations in their respective versions, and both being swarm Pokémon in [[Generation II]] and {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}}.
* A [[Media:Capsule Monsters Papyo.jpg|pre-alpha sketch]] of an [[List of unused Pokémon and character designs|unused Pokémon]] depicts a Pokémon with the same Pokédex number as Qwilfish.
* Qwilfish and {{p|Overqwil|its Hisuian evolved form}} are the only {{type|Poison}} {{DL|List of Pokémon by shape|Pokémon with fins}}, and the only Poison-type Pokémon in the {{egg3|Water 2}}.
* According to several {{tc|Team Plasma Grunt}}s, [[Hugh]]'s hairstyle resembles a Qwilfish.
* Hisuian Qwilfish and its evolved form were first hinted in {{g|Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl}} before their official reveal in {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, where they were mentioned in a [[Sinnoh myths#The Sea's Legend|book]] in the [[Canalave Library]] where Overqwil is referred to as "a Qwilfish with huge spikes".
* Hisuian Qwilfish is the first [[Hisuian form]] that can be caught outside of [[Hisui]] (excluding [[Poké Portal News]] event [[Tera Raid Battle]]s).
* Qwilfish is the only Pokémon with a name beginning with the letter "Q" that is not followed by a "U" like most words in the English language.
**It is also one of only two Pokémon to have a "Q" in its name that is not followed by a "U", the other being its {{rf|Hisuian}} evolved form Overqwil.
* Hisuian Qwilfish and its evolved form are the only dual-type {{2t|Poison|Dark}} Pokémon to have Dark as their primary type instead of their secondary type.
* The [[Pokémon Gold and Silver Spaceworld '97 demo]] has an early design of Qwilfish named プクー ''Pukū'', whose name may be a corruption of 河豚 ''{{wp|fugu}}'' ({{wp|pufferfish}}). It was a pure Water type and would evolve into シビレフグ ''Shibirefugu'' at level 18.

===Origin===
Qwilfish seems to be based on {{wp|Tetraodontidae|pufferfish}} or {{wp|porcupinefish}}, which inflate their bodies when threatened and are covered in {{wp|spine}}s. Many species are incredibly toxic when ingested, which explains Qwilfish's {{t|Poison}} type. However, its ability to directly inject venom through its spines is similar to a {{wp|lionfish}}. It is also reminiscent of a {{wp|naval mine}} due to its round body and ability to explode.

Hisuian Qwilfish's {{t|Dark}} type and poisonous diet may be based on the illegalisation of the {{wp|fugu}} dish due to its toxicity. The law was put in place a few times in Japanese history, including the 1800s (which {{g|Legends: Arceus}} [[Pokémon world in relation to the real world#Sinnoh|appears to be based on]]), but the illegal fugu market continued and thrived for so long that the governing {{wp|shogun}}ate became incapable of enforcing the law. Hisuian Qwilfish and Overqwil appear to be rarer in recent times, which could be a reference to porcupinefish being threatened due to overfishing for the fugu dish.

====Name origin====
Qwilfish may be a combination of ''quill'' and ''fish''.

Harysen may be derived from 針千本 ''harisenbon'' ({{wp|porcupinefish}}). The character 千 ''sen'' in 針千本 ''harisenbon'' means ''thousand'', and this numerical theming is continued with {{p|Overqwil}}'s Japanese name.
