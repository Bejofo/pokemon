'''Palkia''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''パルキア''' ''Palkia'') is a dual-type {{2t|Water|Dragon}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation IV]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Palkia transforms into a second [[#Form data|form]], called its '''Origin Forme''', while holding a [[Lustrous Globe]].

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Form data|Game data&rarr;Form data]] for these details.)

Palkia is the [[game mascot]] of {{game3|Diamond and Pearl|Pokémon Pearl|s}} and its [[remake]] {{pkmn|Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl|Pokémon Shining Pearl}}, appearing on the box art of both games in its normal form.

Along with {{p|Dialga}} and {{p|Giratina}}, it is one of the [[Pokémon of myth]], representing {{wp|space}}. In the past, it was worshipped by the [[Pearl Clan]] under the name '''almighty Sinnoh''' (Japanese: '''シンオウ{{ruby|様|さま}}''' ''Shin'ou-sama'').

==Biology==
[[File:Universal destruction BDSP.png|thumb|left|240px|Palkia destroying the {{pkmn|universe}}]]
Palkia is a light-purple, {{wp|theropod}}-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with stripes and markings of a darker shade and gray underarms and waist. It has round purple-striped plates on its shoulder area, where two pink pearl-like crystals lie encrusted with a gray rim encircling them, and fin-like wings on its back. Palkia's arms have extended formations resembling gauntlets and a purple band around each wrist. Palkia has a long neck that is normally bent, a pointed white crest on the top of its head that extends to its wings, two strong horn-like tusks on the sides of its jaw, and a powerful tail. It has faint cracks along its legs and tail.

According to the [[Sinnoh myths|myths and legends]] of the [[Hisui]]/[[Sinnoh]] [[region]], in the beginning of existence, the [[Mythical Pokémon]] {{p|Arceus}} created {{Pkmn|egg|eggs}} in which the Pokémon of space–Palkia, the Pokémon of time–{{p|Dialga}}, and the Pokémon of antimatter–{{p|Giratina}}, hatched from, all three in their {{form|Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina|Origin Formes}}. After the [[Pokémon universe]] was created, Palkia retreated into its [[Dimension#Palkia's world|own dimension]], where it has lived ever since. It was revered and feared as a deity in the past, being worshipped by the [[Pearl Clan]], who mistook it for Arceus and referred to it as "almighty Sinnoh". Palkia is capable of [[Talking Pokémon|speaking human language]] via telepathy, as seen when it communicates through the leader of the Pearl Clan, [[Irida]]. Palkia and Dialga may be also thrown into a frenzy by powerful [[Space-time distortion|space-time rifts]] created by Giratina. Both can also control and spread the [[Space-time distortion|space-time distortions]] from Giratina's rift, which create [[alpha Pokémon]] and cause [[noble Pokémon]] to become frenzied through lightning bolts that come out of these distortions.

Palkia has power over space: it can warp space and travel to faraway places as well as alternate [[dimension]]s and parallel [[Pokémon multiverse|timelines]]. Additionally, it is capable of {{m|Spacial Rend|rending its targets along with the space around it}}. It even has the power to destroy and create an entire [[Pokémon universe|universe]], either by itself or with {{p|Dialga}}'s aid. As seen in {{aniseries|JN}}, Palkia can open and close dimensional portals to alternate universes. It is said that the birth of Palkia was what caused the walls of the world to disappear, creating a sky that spans for infinity. It is also stated that space becomes more stable with its every breath. Palkia usually travels by levitating. Since Palkia primarily resides in a different dimension, its behavior is nearly impossible to study. The dimension Palkia lives in is said to be in shreds like ribbons.<ref>[https://legends.arceus.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon/palkia/ Palkia (Origin Forme) | Pokémon Legends: Arceus Official Website]</ref> In the anime,  {{mov|Palkia|it}} has been shown to be very protective of its home, and as a result, tends to have violent conflicts with {{mov|Dialga}} when their dimensions intersect. Palkia is capable of travelling by creating a large yellow sphere from its two pearls, then using it to fly very fast, as seen in [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series|Pokémon Mystery Dungeon]]. 

Palkia is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Spacial Rend}}.

===Forms===
[[File:Palkia Origin Forme mouth open.png|thumb|right|240px|Origin Palkia's plate mask opened]]
Palkia can change between its standard form and its Origin Forme.

In its Origin Forme, which is said to be its true form, Palkia's appearance changes drastically from its other theropod-like Forme, taking on a centaur-dragon hybrid look while resembling its creator, {{p|Arceus}}. The main body becomes larger and grayish pink, with light gray accents on the tips of its wings and legs, along with various dark purple accents. Its shoulder plates are larger and seem to be made of the same pearl-like crystals as the ones embedded at the center, with six rectangular dark purple protrusions surrounding them. Its lower half becomes bigger and resembles that of a horse. Palkia's arms become its forelegs, with hooves, protrusions on the knees, and rectangular spikes on its upper forelegs akin to its other Forme's arms. The back legs gain hooves as well, with heels on the back of the foot, and they are bent in such a way that allows Palkia to stand up on its two back legs. The tail becomes shorter and splits into five. On the center of Palkia's abdomen is a structure consisting of two dark purple circular shapes connected to two circles of the same color, resembling Arceus's cross-like wheel. Palkia's neck and markings on its lower body become shorter. The pointed crest on its neck becomes taller and longer. Its lower jaw gets a plate-like mask covering it, with multiple spikes all over it: one at the front, a pair extending towards the bottom of the jaw, and two pairs on either side extending towards the back. The plate-like mask can be lowered to reveal its mouth when roaring or using attacks.

Palkia is at its full power when in its Origin Forme, and is supposedly permanently in this state while in its home dimension. It is believed that Palkia's Origin Forme resembles Arceus as a strategy in order to gain its power. Palkia's transformation into its Origin Forme can be triggered using the [[Lustrous Globe]] or through a radiant light. Origin Forme Palkia can walk on all fours and fly, and is capable of unleashing meteors and shockwaves. Its {{m|Spacial Rend}} can even be charged into a more powerful version of itself while in Origin Forme, as seen in its boss battle in {{g|Legends: Arceus}}. The crystals and purple accents on Palkia's body glow brightly when it uses its powers.

===NPC appearances===
* {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}}: {{mdc|Palkia|2}} plays a major part in the game's post-story. Palkia first appears when he attacks the {{player}} and their partner at [[Sharpedo Bluff]], having learnt from {{mdc|Darkrai|2}} (disguised as {{p|Cresselia}}) that they were responsible for space being distorted, but the real Cresselia appeared and sorted things out.
* {{g|Ranger: Shadows of Almia}}: Palkia appears as a bonus boss during one of the [[Ranger Net]] extra missions. Palkia was injured and entered [[Hippowdon Temple]]. In its pain, it warped the space of the [[Almia]] [[region]] and caused all of the locations of Almia to be shuffled together.
* [[Pokémon Legends: Arceus]]: [[Temple of Sinnoh#Special encounters|Palkia]] is a main antagonist and boss in the game. It is one of {{ga|Arceus}}'s creations alongside {{p|Dialga}} and {{p|Giratina}}. After [[Volo]] and Giratina tore open a [[Space-time distortion|rift in space-time]] above [[Mount Coronet]], Palkia along with Dialga, became enraged, causing many [[Alpha Pokémon]] and [[Space-time distortion]]s to appear all over [[Hisui]].

===Form data===
Along with the other members of the [[Pokémon of myth]], Palkia has the ability to switch to a second form: Origin Forme.

The standard form of Palkia debuted in {{2v2|Diamond|Pearl}}, and its Origin Forme was introduced in {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, in which it changes between its standard form and Origin Forme when exposed to a [[Lustrous Globe]]. In {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, Palkia transforms into its Origin Forme while holding a Lustrous Globe. If it is deposited in {{g|HOME}}, it will revert to its standard form.

The forms differ in their [[base stats]]: Palkia's Origin Forme has decreased {{stat|Attack}} and increased {{stat|Speed}} compared to its standard form, though its base stat total is the same. In Pokémon Legends: Arceus, its [[signature move]], {{m|Spacial Rend}}, has modified base power and accuracy when used by its Origin Form, as well as a unique animation.

==In animation==
===Main series===
[[File:Palkia anime.png|thumb|250px|Palkia in {{aniseries|JN}}]]
====Major appearances====
=====[[Palkia (movie)]]=====
Palkia made its physical debut in ''[[M10|The Rise of Darkrai]]'', where it fought with {{mov|Dialga}} and {{OBP|Darkrai|M10}} in a {{pkmn|battle}} that nearly destroyed [[Alamos Town]]. It reappeared in a flashback in ''[[M11|Giratina and the Sky Warrior]]''. In ''[[M12|Arceus and the Jewel of Life]]'', Palkia was shown for the first time with both the other members of [[Pokémon of myth|its trio]]. It joined forces with Dialga and {{mov|Giratina}} to fight against {{OBP|Arceus|M12}}.

=====Palkia (recurring)=====
A Palkia appeared in ''[[JN089|The Gates of Warp!]]'' and ''[[JN090|Showdown at the Gates of Warp!]]'', where it was a target of [[Alternate World Team Rocket]], along with {{OBP|Dialga|recurring}}. Using a [[Red Chain]], Alternate World Team Rocket forced the two [[Legendary Pokémon]] to fight, creating time distortions that caused Pokémon to start [[Devolution|devolving]] and eventually revert into {{pkmn|Egg}}s, which Team Rocket would then steal and raise to be their own. The battle was finally stopped when {{Ash}}, {{an|Dawn}}, [[Goh]], [[Chloe]], and their alternate world counterparts prayed for {{p|Arceus}} to do so. Freed from the Red Chain, Dialga and Palkia then undid all the devolutions their battle had caused.

=====Other=====
In ''[[DP152|The Battle Finale of Legend!]]'', Palkia and Dialga were summoned by [[Cyrus]] on the [[Spear Pillar]]. They were put under his control through the use of the Red Chain and were tasked by him to open a portal to another dimension, wanting a world of his own. After the Red Chain's destruction and Cyrus's exit, Palkia and Dialga rampaged, creating a danger for [[Sinnoh]]. However, the two were calmed down and sent away with the help of the {{an|lake guardians}}.

In ''[[M18|Hoopa and the Clash of Ages]]'', Palkia was one of six Legendary Pokémon summoned and hypnotized by the shadow {{form|Hoopa|Hoopa Unbound}} as its reinforcements. It and its teammates engaged in a battle against the {{p|Latios}}, {{p|Latias}}, and {{Shiny}} {{p|Rayquaza}} summoned to protect the real {{an|Hoopa}} in [[Dahara City]]. Eventually, after the shadow Hoopa was sealed in a [[Prison Bottle]], the hypnosis on Palkia and the other Legendary Pokémon was lifted, and Palkia departed for its home.

====Minor appearances====
Palkia debuted as a shadowy figure in a fantasy in ''[[DP033|All Dressed Up With Somewhere To Go!]]''.

Palkia appeared in a fantasy in ''[[DP036|A Secret Sphere of Influence!]]''.

Palkia appeared in a fantasy in ''[[DP097|Double Team Turnover!]]''.

In ''[[DP178|For The Love of Meowth!]]'', {{MTR}}'s fantasy featured Palkia.

A silhouetted Palkia appeared in a fantasy in ''[[JN053|Healing the Healer!]]''.

====Pokédex entries====

{{Animedexfooter/Pokémon|Galar}}

===Pokémon Generations===
[[File:Palkia PG.png|thumb|250px|Palkia in [[Pokémon Generations]]]]
In ''[[PG11|The New World]]'', Palkia and Dialga were captured at [[Spear Pillar]] by [[Cyrus]], who intended to use them to destroy the world and create a new one. Along with Dialga, it was freed by {{p|Giratina}} before they could help Cyrus succeed in his goal.

===Movie adaptations===
{{main|Palkia (movie)}}
Palkia debuted in {{ma|The Rise of Darkrai}} manga adaptation, where it was fighting {{mov|Dialga}}. In the {{ma|Arceus and the Jewel of Life}} manga adaptation, Palkia, along with the members of its trio, were summoned by [[Sheena]] to help Ash and his friends. Palkia and the other members of its trio soon engaged {{OBP|Arceus|M12}} in a battle.

Palkia also appeared in {{OBP|Arceus and the Jewel of Life|graphic novel|the graphic novel adaptation}} of ''[[M12|Arceus and the Jewel of Life]]''.

===Pocket Monsters Diamond & Pearl===

===Pokémon Adventures===
{{main|Pokémon of myth (Adventures)}}
===={{MangaArc|Diamond & Pearl}}====
Palkia first appeared in ''[[PS410|Creeping Away from Cradily]]''. Palkia, along with Dialga, was summoned by [[Cyrus]] in order to create a new world. Cyrus used the Red Chains to force Dialga and Palkia to fight each other in order to distort time and space and create a portal that would swallow the existing world. {{adv|Diamond}}, {{adv|Pearl}} and {{adv|Platinum}} worked together with their Pokémon to free Dialga and Palkia from their controlled states.

Later on, an accident with handling [[Charon]]'s machine caused Dialga, Palkia and Cyrus to be dragged into the portal before it closed completely.

===={{MangaArc|Platinum}}====
It was revealed that {{p|Giratina}} imprisoned both Dialga and Palkia in the [[Distortion World]] before setting off into the current dimension to wreak havoc. Soon, Cyrus and Diamond met in the Distortion World, and agreed to free Dialga and Palkia using their Pokémon. Dialga and Palkia later resumed their struggle against Giratina in the Distortion World. When Charon decided to escape from the Distortion World on Giratina, Pearl got on Palkia and chased after him. Giratina was eventually defeated, with Dialga and Palkia forcing it back into the Distortion World for good before both returned to the Spear Pillar.

===={{MangaArc|HeartGold & SoulSilver}}====
Palkia was created in the [[Sinjoh Ruins]], along with Dialga and Giratina, by {{p|Arceus}}'s creation process, which was forced by [[Team Rocket]]'s {{tc|Executive}}s. Knowing that the creation process would threaten the [[Johto]] region, Team Rocket's true leader {{adv|Giovanni}} returned with [[Lance]] and [[Pryce]] to keep the three Pokémon of myth at bay while {{adv|Gold}} tried to calm Arceus down. Palkia was kept at bay by Lance and his {{p|Dragonite}}. Once Arceus was eventually becalmed, Dialga and Palkia departed from Johto and were spotted by [[Cynthia]].

===Pokémon Diamond and Pearl Adventure!===
Palkia appeared in ''[[DPA20|The Advent of the Legendary Pokémon!!]]'' as a silhouette. It officially debuted in ''[[DPA21|Will Hareta's Wish Get Through?!]]''.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Palkia (TCG)}}

==Other appearances==
===[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]===
[[File:SSBBSpearPillarPalkia.png|thumb|200px|Palkia on the {{St|Spear Pillar}} stage in [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]]]
Palkia occasionally appears on the {{St|Spear Pillar}} stage as one of three Pokémon that controls it. It only appears on the stage when the ground on the upper level has a purple tinge to it. Unlike {{p|Dialga}} and {{p|Cresselia}}, however, it will use its powers to distort the stage in multiple ways. Some examples include tilting the stage, turning the stage completely upside down, and reversing the screen itself (the last two will cause the movement controls to be reversed temporarily). It often shoots beams in the cave below, dealing a lot of damage to the players that get caught in the blast.

====Trophy information====
''"A Spatial Pokémon. In the [[Sinnoh]] [[region]], this {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} has been revered for many generations, much like Dialga. Dialga warps time, but Palkia has control over space. It lives between parallel dimensions and is known for its power, rumored to be able to warp space. It can use {{m|Spacial Rend}} to rip through the very space an enemy resides in, damaging the foe at the same time. It is Pearl's [[Game mascot|mascot]]."''

===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U]]===
[[File:Palkia SSB4.jpg|thumb|250px|Palkia summoned from a {{i|Poké Ball}} in [[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U]]]]
Palkia appears as a Pokémon released from a {{i|Poké Ball}}. It uses Spacial Rend, which flips the stage for a time, and can cause damage. Palkia also causes damage on contact.

[[File:Palkia_3DS_trophy_SSB4.png|thumb|left|150px|Palkia trophy in ''Super Smash Bros. for 3DS'']]
Palkia also appears as a trophy in both versions of the game.

====Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''Stories surround this Legendary Water/ Dragon-type Pokémon, saying that it has control over all of space. Its Spacial Rend attack will tear space and flip the screen upside down. When this happens, the left and right controls of the fighters will become flipped as well. ''

'''PAL''': ''Stories of this Legendary Pokémon say that Palkia is a god that controls all of space. When it uses its Spacial Rend attack in Super Smash Bros., it causes the screen to flip upside down. If that wasn't confusing enough, it also flips the left and right controls!''
{{-}}

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
[[File:SSBUPalkia.png|thumb|left|250px|Palkia summoned from a {{i|Poké Ball}} in [[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]]]
[[File:SSBUSpearPillarPalkia.png|thumb|250px|Palkia on the {{St|Spear Pillar}} stage in [[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]]]
Palkia returns as a Pokémon summoned from a Poké Ball, using Spacial Rend like its appearance in ''For Nintendo 3DS/Wii U'' while also appearing as a {{sbw|Spirits (characters)|Spirit}}. Palkia cannot be summoned on 3D Land, Arena Ferox, Balloon Fight, Brinstar, Dream Land GB, Golden Plains, Green Hill Zone, Jungle Japes, Mushroomy Kingdom, Mute City SNES, Paper Mario, PictoChat 2, {{St|Prism Tower}}, Reset Bomb Forest, {{St|Spear Pillar}} (for obvious reasons), Suzaku Castle, Tomodachi Life, Tortimer Island, WarioWare Inc., or Yoshi's Island. Palkia's Spacial Rend will not be able to flip the stage upside down if a fighter is equipped with a spirit with Screen-Flip Immunity, though it will still remain on stage to damage any opponents who touch it. Palkia also reprises its role as a stage hazard on the returning {{St|Spear Pillar}} stage. Spear Pillar now allows for any of the three [[Legendary Pokémon]] to appear each time, rather than being set for the whole match.

==Trivia==
[[File:Spatial World.png|thumb|right|250px|Palkia's world in ''[[M12|Arceus and the Jewel of Life]]'']]
* Origin Forme Palkia is the [[List of Pokémon by weight|heaviest]] {{type|Water}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}.
* In games prior to {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, Palkia has a catch rate of 30.
* The gems on Palkia's shoulders resemble Pale [[Sphere]]s.
* Palkia's [[gender]] differs between various [[Pokémon]] media. It is gender unknown in the [[core series]] games, male in {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}}'s story (although it is still gender unknown for purposes of gameplay) and female in the {{pmin|Russia}}n dub of the {{pkmn|animated series}}.
* Palkia is in the highest [[IQ]] group. [[List of Pokémon by IQ group|It takes this position in IQ group J]], and is the only Pokémon in IQ group J.
* Palkia is the only Pokémon that will cause an {{p|Arceus}} equipped with the [[Legend Plate]] to become {{t|Dragon}}-type when using {{m|Judgment}}. This is because Palkia's type permutation is the only one that can result in a Dragon-type Judgment, and Palkia is the only Pokémon with this permutation in [[Pokémon Legends: Arceus]].
* Palkia and {{p|Dialga}} are the only two Pokémon that can be legitimately caught in every kind of [[Poké Ball]] in the core series to date (besides the [[Park Ball]], which cannot be the registered Poké Ball of any Pokémon), as they are the only two Pokémon that can be caught with the [[Origin Ball]].
* Although the portal to [[Dimension#Palkia's world|Palkia's world]] appears in [[core series]] games, the inside of that world has only been shown in the {{pkmn|animated series}}.
* In [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Darkness]], Palkia, along with [[Primal Dialga]], the [[legendary giants]], the {{p|Magnemite}} family, and {{p|Regigigas}}, all speak in all capital letters, unlike the other Pokémon in the game.
* At the end of one of Palkia's roars from the animated series and {{pkmn|movies}}, a roar of {{wp|King Ghidorah|Mecha-King Ghidorah}}, a {{wp|kaiju}} from the 1991 {{wp|Toho}} film ''{{wp|Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah}}'', can be heard.

===Origin===
Palkia, along with {{p|Dialga}}, may be based on the {{wp|Shinto}} legend of {{wp|Izanami}} and {{wp|Izanagi}}, who are said to have created one island with a spear, erected a pillar on it, and from there created the islands of Japan. Appearance-wise, Palkia is likely based after a European {{wp|dragon}} combined with a {{wp|pearl}}. Its appearance may also be derived from the ''{{wp|Plateosaurus}}'' or other bipedal dinosaurs such as the ''{{wp|Oviraptor}}''. The plates covering its face along with the crest on its neck together resemble the helmets worn by soldiers in {{wp|Ancient Greece}} and {{wp|Ancient Rome|Rome}} — this resemblance is made even more apparent in its Origin Forme.

Its {{t|Water}} [[type]] is possibly inspired by its association with pearls, or the large space that {{wp|ocean}}s are known to span. Metaphorically, it could be a reference to the ever-changing forms of physical matter in the universe, with energy and matter flowing between states and changing forms. It could also refer to the Ancient Greek astronomy depicting Earth submerged in water. Its Water type might also represent the liquid {{wp|state of matter}}, whereas Dialga's {{type|Steel}} represents the solid state and {{p|Giratina}}'s {{type|Ghost}} represents the gaseous state.

Palkia's Origin Forme appears to be based on {{p|Arceus}}. It bears similarities to a {{wp|centaur}} and the winged horse {{wp|Pegasus}} from Greek mythology. As Arceus seems to take inspiration from the ''{{wp|qilin}}'', this influence is seen with Origin Forme Palkia as well with its mix of equine and draconic qualities (including Palkia's Dragon typing).

====Name origin====
Palkia may be derived from パール ''pāru'' (pearl), ''[[Wiktionary:galaxia|galaxia]]'', and 海 ''kai'' (sea, ocean, referring to their liquid state of matter theme).
