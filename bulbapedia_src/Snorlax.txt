'''Snorlax''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''カビゴン''' ''Kabigon'') is a {{type|Normal}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Munchlax}} when [[friendship Evolution|leveled up with high friendship]].

Snorlax can [[Gigantamax]] into '''Gigantamax Snorlax''' if it has the {{DL|Gigantamax|Gigantamax Factor}}.

In Generations {{gen|I}} and {{gen|II}} games, their [[remake]]s, and [[Pokémon X and Y]], wild Snorlax can be found sleeping in inconvenient locations. In order to catch one, a Trainer must first awaken it with music from either a [[Poké Flute]] or the [[Pokégear]] set to the Poké Flute channel.

Snorlax is the [[game mascot]] of {{g|Sleep}}.

==Biology==
Snorlax is a huge, bipedal, dark blue-green {{wp|mammal}}ian {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a cream-colored face, belly, and feet. Its body is composed of mostly its belly, as its limbs are comparatively small. Its head is large with small, pointed ears, and two pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw. It has round feet, which both have three claws and a circular brown paw pad, and short arms with five claws on each hand. Snorlax's bulk makes it the [[List of Pokémon by weight|heaviest]] {{t|Normal}} type.
[[File:Snorlax swimming.png|thumb|220px|Snorlax swimming in the sea]]
Snorlax is often found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Mountain Pokémon|mountains and forests}}. It wakes up only to eat, requiring between 880-900&nbsp;lbs. (399-400&nbsp;kg) of food per day before returning to its slumber, although it can also eat while it is resting. It is not a picky eater, as its strong stomach allows it to eat even moldy food without feeling any ill effects. Once a Snorlax enters its slumber, it is almost impossible to wake it up. A [[Poké Flute]] is one of the few things that can awaken Snorlax from its slumber. It can even handle thorny plants or {{p|Muk}}'s poison. Snorlax is docile enough to let children and small Pokémon bounce on its large stomach. Despite its apparent laziness, however, Snorlax can exhibit tremendous power when prompted. In the ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' episode ''[[EP094|Snack Attack]]'', Snorlax is shown to be capable of swimming in the water. Snorlax is known to appear without warning in villages and steal their food supplies, such as rice granaries, which has long been considered a disaster whenever it happens. Snorlax also tends to sleep on areas with bridges, often blocking others from crossing through. [[Professor Neroli]] does research on Snorlax, particularly on their ability to attract Pokémon around them to sleep. A lot of Pokémon tend to gather around Snorlax to sleep near it or on it.

Snorlax is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of using the [[Z-Move]] {{m|Pulverizing Pancake}}.

===Forms===
[[File:143Snorlax-Gigantamax 2.png|thumb|left|250px|Gigantamax Snorlax attacking]]
Snorlax has a [[Gigantamax]] form.

As Gigantamax Snorlax, seeds and small pebbles that were tangled in its belly fur go through immense growth, causing patches of grass, bushes, rocks, and a large tree to sprout upon its belly. The tree has three red clouds circling it. The {{Berries}} that grow on Gigantamax Snorlax's tree include a [[Sitrus Berry]], a [[Magost Berry]], and a [[Haban Berry]].

Gigantamax Snorlax almost never moves; even when in battle it only slightly lifts its body and attacks by flailing with its arms and legs. However, its attacks are very powerful — Gigantamax Snorlax is considered to be one of the strongest [[Dynamax]] Pokémon to have been discovered.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon-galar-region/gigantamax-snorlax/ Gigantamax Snorlax | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref>

Gigantamax Snorlax is the only known Pokémon capable of using the [[G-Max Move]] {{m|G-Max Replenish}}.

===NPC appearances===
* {{vg|Pokémon Ranger}}: Snorlax will be seen sleeping throughout the game, effectively cutting off certain areas until later on. It will eventually remain in a cave in the [[Sekra Range]]. Once the rest of the [[List of Pokémon by Fiore Browser number|Ranger Browser]] has been completed, it will wake up and can be captured.

====Major appearances====
=====[[Ash's Snorlax]]=====
In ''[[EP094|Snack Attack!]]'', a {{pkmn2|wild}} Snorlax was eating the grapefruits of the [[Seven Grapefruit Islands|Grapefruit Islands]]. {{Ash}} managed to {{pkmn2|caught|catch}} it near the end of the episode. After Ash's adventures in the [[Orange Islands]], Snorlax spent most of its time at {{an|Professor Oak}}'s [[Professor Oak's Laboratory|lab]].

=====Other=====
Snorlax debuted in ''[[EP041|Wake Up Snorlax!]]'', under the ownership of a [[hippie]]. The hippie's Snorlax had fallen asleep in front of a river flowing to a small village, leaving it up to Ash and {{ashfr}} to wake it up.

In ''[[PK04|Pikachu's Rescue Adventure]]'', a Snorlax used its strength to hold on to the nest containing {{TP|Misty|Togepi}} and some {{p|Exeggcute}}.

A Snorlax is a part of the [[Pichu Brothers]]' Posse that first appeared in ''[[PK07|Pikachu & Pichu]]''. It reappeared in other episodes of [[Pokémon Chronicles]] and made a cameo appearance in ''[[M11|Giratina and the Sky Warrior]]''.

In ''[[PK09|Snorlax Snowman]]'', multiple {{DL|List of alternately colored Pokémon in animation|Snowmen Snorlax|alternately colored Snorlax}} had adapted to more frigid climates. One of them befriended {{AP|Pikachu}} and his friends.

In ''[[AG088|The Garden of Eatin']]'', a Snorlax was devouring the bananas in [[Marcel]]'s [[Banana Slakoth Garden]]. Marcel's newly evolved {{p|Vigoroth}} defeated the Snorlax, allowing him to capture it. Afterwards, Marcel built a relaxation room around it.

In [[PK13]], a Snorlax ate {{AP|Corphish}}'s apples that were on sale.

In ''[[DP076|A Full Course Tag Battle!]]'', [[Roman]] used a Snorlax in a [[Multi Battle|Tag Battle]] alongside [[Kylie]]'s {{p|Munchlax}} against {{Ash}} and {{an|Brock}}, who used {{AP|Pikachu}} and {{TP|Brock|Sudowoodo}}, respectively, but they were defeated.

In ''[[DP160|A Marathon Rivalry!]]'', {{OBP|Daniel|DP160}}'s Snorlax competed in the [[Pokéathlon]]. It managed to win the race by a slim margin due to its belly, barely beating Pikachu.

{{main|Snorlax (TCG)}}

==Other appearances==
[[File:Snorlax SSBB.png|thumb|200px|Snorlax in [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]]]
===[[Super Smash Bros.]]===
When released from a {{i|Poké Ball}}, Snorlax will ascend into the air before descending over a large area of the screen with a {{m|Body Slam}} that sends any opponent underneath flying.

===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]===
Snorlax does the same maneuver as it did in the previous game, but covers a smaller area.

Snorlax is also a [[Poké Floats|Poké Float]]. It is lying down asleep and so fighting occurs on its head and belly.

====Melee trophy information====
''Snorlax love to sleep and love to eat: these portly Pokémon get grumpy if they don't get 888 pounds of food per day. After snacking out, they always nap. They have cast-iron stomachs and can eat moldy and even rotten food with no digestion problems. They are the heaviest Pokémon on record, weighing in at over 1,000 pounds.''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]===
Snorlax once again performs the same maneuver as the previous games.

====Brawl trophy information====
''"A Sleeping Pokémon. It's the ultimate loafer. Sometimes children like to play on top its big belly. Once in a slumber, not even the hardest rain or the fiercest wind will wake it. Snorlax recovers health and restores its physical state by sleeping, and it proves daunting with its damaging {{m|Snore}} attack. Snorlax is the king of Sleeping Pokémon."''

===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U]]===
[[File:Snorlax SSB4.png|thumb|240px|Snorlax in Super Smash Bros. for 3DS.]]
[[File:Snorlax_3DS_trophy_SSB4.png|thumb|left|150px|Snorlax trophy in ''Super Smash Bros. for 3DS'']]
Snorlax reappears as a Poké Ball summon in these games, behaving the same way as before.

Snorlax also appears as a trophy in both versions of the game.

====Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''This sleepy, Normal-type Pokémon is huge! It eats more than 900 lb. of food every day. Most of the time not spent eating is spent sleeping. That big, round body comes in handy when it's brought onto a Smash Bros. battlefield—the Body Slam attack will send anyone who gets hit flying into the air!''

'''PAL''': ''Snorlax is often referred to as the Sleeping Pokémon, and there's a good reason for that! This giant loafer spends almost all its time snoozing, getting up for just long enough each day to scoff up a tidy 400kg of food. In this game, it soars into the air and uses its Body Slam attack, smacking into fighters like a giant wrecking ball.''
{{-}}
===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Snorlax reappears as a Poké Ball summon, retaining its behavior from past games. It also appears as a {{sbw|Spirits (characters)|Spirit}}. In the Spirit Battle, Snorlax, who is depicted as a giant gray King K. Rool, is immobile but has 500 HP and slowly regains HP. The player fails if they cannot KO Snorlax before the time runs out.

==Trivia==
* In several 3D games, such as in the core series and [[Pokémon Stadium series]], Snorlax open their eyes when they faint.
* In [[Pokémon Snap]], Snorlax stands up and dances to the music when the [[Poké Flute]] is used.
* In {{2v2|HeartGold|SoulSilver}}, if the {{player}} interacts with a Snorlax that is {{pkmn2|walking}} with them while at [[Mt. Silver]], the message "SNORLAX is feeling very eager" will appear. This is due to {{ga|Red}}, who is also at Mt. Silver, owning a Snorlax as well. While the player is on Mt. Silver, unique messages will also appear if the player interacts with a walking {{p|Pikachu}} or {{p|Charizard}}.
* In {{game|Gold and Silver|s}}, Snorlax is programmed to be able to learn {{m|Charm}} through {{pkmn|breeding}}, but no other Pokémon in the {{egg2|Monster}} can legitimately learn it to pass down as an [[Egg Move]] in those games. In [[Generation III]] on, Snorlax can inherit the move from {{p|Bulbasaur}} by chain breeding.
* Snorlax's evolutionary line is the only one to have all of its members appear from a {{i|Poké Ball}} within a single [[Super Smash Bros.]] game.
* In {{game|Gold and Silver|s}}, Snorlax is the only Pokémon to receive a +40 catch rate modifier when a [[Heavy Ball]] is used.
** In {{game|Crystal}}, a [[List of glitches in Generation II#Heavy Ball junk data glitch|bug]] causes the capture formula for the [[Heavy Ball]] to incorrectly retrieve the weights of {{p|Kadabra}}, {{p|Tauros}}, and {{p|Sunflora}}, so they also get a +40 catch rate modifier.
* Snorlax is the only {{DL|List of Pokémon by color|black}} Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
* Snorlax is tied with {{p|Gengar}} for the most [[Pokédex entry|Pokédex entries]] in ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'', with a total of 7.
* Snorlax is the subject of a campaign known as [[Project Snorlax]], which was launched by [[The Pokémon Company]] on March 17, 2023.
* Snorlax's English name was suggested by Bill Giese, who assisted in the naming of many [[Generation I]] Pokémon.<ref name=MonsterKids />

===Design variations===
{{main|Pokémon controversies#Four-fingered hands|Pokémon controversies → Four-fingered hands}}
Snorlax was originally depicted with an inconsistent number of claws on its hands. In its original artwork for {{game|Red and Green|s}}, Snorlax had four claws on each of its hands. This is also seen in the early {{pkmn|manga}}, such as [[The Electric Tale of Pikachu]] and [[Ash and Pikachu]], and in Snorlax's [[Bandai Pokémon Carddass Cards|Carddass]] card art. 

In its artwork for {{game|Red and Blue|s}} and its front sprites prior to {{game|Emerald}}, as well as in early depictions in the [[Pokémon Adventures]] manga, Snorlax only has three visible claws on each hand. Notably, despite having five fingers in its artwork for {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}}, only three claws are visible in its front sprite for those games. 

Snorlax has always been depicted with five fingers in {{aniseries|PTS}}, including the [[original series]], and from Emerald onward, it is consistently depicted with five fingers across media.

A few of Snorlax's early sprites and artwork can be seen below. For the rest of Snorlax's sprites, see its [[#Sprites|Sprites]] section. For more images, see [[a:Category:Snorlax|Snorlax images on the Bulbagarden Archives]].

===Concept and development===
Snorlax was designed by [[Ken Sugimori]].<ref>[https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/fukayomi/20180501-OYT8T50139/1/ Page 1 of Yomiuri interview] with [[Ken Sugimori]], [[Kōji Nishino]], and [[Atsuko Nishida]] (Japanese)</ref>

===Origin===
Snorlax's appearance and behavior of constantly eating and sleeping were directly inspired by [[Game Freak]] planner [[Kōji Nishino]].<ref>[https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/fukayomi/20180501-OYT8T50139/2/ Page 2 of Yomiuri interview] with [[Ken Sugimori]], [[Kōji Nishino]], and [[Atsuko Nishida]] (Japanese)</ref><ref name=GameInformer /> Additionally, Snorlax may be loosely based on {{wp|hibernation|hibernating}} {{wp|bear}}s or {{wp|teddy bear}}s. It may also be based on a {{wp|Postprandial somnolence|food coma}}, as it eats large quantities of food, then takes a nap, both of which are symptomatic of the condition. Snorlax's Gigantamax form resembles a small hill.

====Name origin====
Snorlax is a combination of ''snore'' and ''lax'' or ''lackadaisical''. It was reportedly derived from ''Esquilax'', the name of a nonexistent medieval creature described in ''{{wp|The Simpsons}}'' episode "{{wp|Lisa's Wedding}}".<ref name=MonsterKids>Dockery, Daniel (October 4, 2022). ''[[Monster Kids: How Pokémon Taught a Generation to Catch Them All]]''. Running Press. p. 33. ISBN 978-0762479504.</ref> Snorlax may also involve ''relax''.<ref>(2006). ''[[Pokémon Fan (US)|Pokémon Fan]]: 10th Anniversary News Booklet'', p. 8 ([https://archive.org/details/10-anni-book/ Archive])</ref>

Kabigon is derived from ''{{wk|Kirby}}'' (Japanese: カービィ ''Kābī''), the eponymous main character of [[Nintendo]]'s {{wk|Kirby (series)|''Kirby'' video game series}}. In an interview with Game Informer, [[Junichi Masuda]] stated that Kōji Nishino, the main inspiration for Snorlax, used to be called "Kirby" by Game Freak staff as a nod to his large appetite.<ref name=GameInformer>Shea, Brian (October 24, 2019). "[https://web.archive.org/web/20230805233026/https://www.gameinformer.com/interview/2019/10/24/more-burning-questions-for-the-pokemon-series More Burning Questions For The Pokémon Series]."
