'''Zapdos''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''サンダー''' ''Thunder'') is a dual-type {{2t|Electric|Flying}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation I]].

In [[Galar]], Zapdos has a dual-type {{2t|Fighting|Flying}} [[regional form]], introduced in [[The Crown Tundra]] expansion. Neither Kantonian Zapdos nor Galarian Zapdos are known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

Along with {{p|Articuno}} and {{p|Moltres}}, it is one of the three [[legendary birds]] of [[Kanto]].

==Biology==
[[File:Bandai Zapdos card.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Zapdos electrifying its talons; [[Bandai Pokémon Carddass Cards]].]]
Zapdos is a large, {{wp|Aves|avian}}  {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with predominantly yellow plumage. It has small, triangular eyes with black around them and a long, thin, light orange beak. Its wings and tail are a mass of spiky feathers and there are black feathers covering the back of its wings and inner tail feathers. A large crest of spiked feathers surrounds its head. Its thighs are tan, and it has thin, light orange legs. It has feet with three forward-facing toes and one backward-facing toe; each toe has a short talon. 

{{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Rare Pokémon|Rarely seen}}, in [[An Illustrated Book of POCKET MONSTERS]], Zapdos is said to be a divine bird that presides over the heavens, spending millennia among thunderclouds, before descending with lightning bolts. When Zapdos flaps its glittering wings, it releases electricity that can potentially cause thunderstorms. Naturally, it produces massive crackling and snapping sounds when it flies; these are attributed to the lightning bolts it sheds when airborne. Zapdos reportedly appears only during thunderstorms and gains power when struck by lightning. When attacking, [[Bandai Pokémon Carddass Cards]] shows that Zapdos can electrify its talons. In ''[[The Power of One]]'', Zapdos is said to regulate the ocean's currents, and when captured, they become catastrophically unstable. It is also shown to communicate with other Electric-type Pokémon through exchanging lightning bolts. Furthermore, it is exceptionally territorial, immediately conquering and terraforming [[Fire Island]] after {{p|Moltres}} is captured in the interests of controlling the [[Orange Islands]] with thunder. It is said to be capable of defeating a lone {{p|Lugia}} when battling alongside {{p|Articuno}} and {{p|Moltres}}. 

As seen in [[Pokémon Horizons: The Series|''Pokémon Horizons'']], like other [[Legendary Pokémon]], Zapdos can be found in the Pokémon paradise [[Laqua]]. Zapdos loves [[Zapdos Treat]]s made by [[Snacksworth]], who once saw it fly right by him in the past.

{{pkmn2|Shadow}} Zapdos is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Shadow Bolt}}.

===Forms===
Zapdos has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Galarian}} Zapdos.

In [[Galar]], Zapdos has a different appearance. Its body is red-orange with black plumage. Its head features yellow eyes with more pronounced, mask-like black coloration around them, a shorter black beak, and a longer, more visible neck. Its legs are black, longer, and more muscular, its thigh feathers are also black, and its talons are yellow with red rings at their bases. Its red-orange wings are smaller, with small black markings that appear to be remnants of its Kantonian counterpart's black plumage. Finally, it has a row of spiky feathers along its chest, and a similar row of black feathers on its back.

Belligerent by nature and ever thirsting for battle, {{rf|Galarian}} Zapdos seeks out opponents stronger than itself so it could test its might. Its powerful legs allow it to perform {{m|Thunderous Kick|devastating kicks}} capable of destroying a dump truck, and it can run across mountains at up to 180&nbsp;mph (300&nbsp;km/h). Its wings have atrophied to the point that it can barely fly, but its movements are so swift that they have been compared to a lightning strike. This Pokémon earned the name of its Kantonian counterpart due to the electric-like crackling sounds that come from its feathers rubbing together. It is constantly migrating around the world but can be found in the [[Crown Tundra]] once every few decades congregating with the other birds at the [[Dyna Tree Hill|Dyna Tree]] to eat its fruits.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/expansionpass/pokemon/galarian-zapdos/ Galarian Zapdos | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref>

Galarian Zapdos is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Thunderous Kick}}.

==Trivia==
* In English, the {{pkmn|category}} "Electric Pokémon" is shared by {{p|Elekid}}, {{p|Electabuzz}}, and [[Kanto|Kantonian]] Zapdos.
** In Japanese, Elekid has the category でんきポケモン ''Denki Pokémon'' (Electric Pokémon), while the other two Pokémon share the category でんげきポケモン ''Dengeki Pokémon'' (Electric Shock Pokémon).
* Out of all the [[Legendary Pokémon]] with fixed in-game locations, Zapdos can be obtained with the fewest number of [[Badge]]s: two. The {{player}} can catch Zapdos with only the {{badge|Boulder}} and either the {{badge|Cascade}}{{sup/7|PE}} or the {{badge|Soul}}{{sup/1|RBY}}{{sup/3|FRLG}}.
** The Cascade Badge can be skipped in the Generation I games by sending a [[drink]] from another game through [[Pokémon Stadium 2]]'s {{OBP|Pokémon Lab|Stadium}}, which allows the player to access [[Saffron City]] and ultimately the rest of Kanto's mainland without ever having to obtain [[HM01]] or use {{m|Cut}} outside of battle.
* Zapdos and {{p|Jolteon}}'s Japanese names are almost exactly the same as each other's, with a final {{j|～ス}} ''~s'' being the only difference.
* Kantonian Zapdos possesses a type advantage over all of the other members of [[Legendary birds|its trio]], as well as {{p|Lugia}}, often viewed as the leader of the trio.
** This is reversed for the trio's [[regional form]]s, with Galarian Zapdos possessing a type disadvantage against the other members and Lugia.
* In ''[[EP036|The Bridge Bike Gang]]'', [[Chopper]]'s bike is decorated to resemble a Zapdos.
* Zapdos's [[cry]] in [[Pokémon Journeys: The Series]] is the same as {{p|Lunala}}'s, as seen in ''[[JN040|A Crackling Raid Battle!]]''.
* Zapdos's English name was suggested by Bill Giese, who assisted in the naming of many [[Generation I]] Pokémon.<ref name=MonsterKids />
* Zapdos and the other two legendary birds had Australian beetle species [[List of references to Pokémon in science|named after them]]: ''Binburrum articuno'', ''Binburrum zapdos'', and ''Binburrum moltres''. The three species were first described in 2020, and were collectively named after the Legendary birds to reflect their rarity.<ref>[https://twitter.com/YHsiaoBeetle/status/1345310387059625985 Tweet by Yun Hsiao (@YHsiaoBeetle)], posted Jan 2, 2021</ref><ref>Hsiao, Y. & Pollock, D.

===Origin===
Zapdos seems to be based on the {{wp|Native Americans in the United States|Native American}} legend of the {{wp|thunderbird (mythology)|thunderbird}}, a spirit of thunder, lightning, and rain that took the form of a giant {{wp|bird}}. The beating of the wings was said to create thunder. It may also have been based on the {{wp|lightning bird}}, a bird created from wherever lightning hits the earth. Aesthetically, it may be based on {{wp|hummingbird}}s, due to the long beak, the rather simple wings, and described violent behavior.

As suggested by the Pokédex entries, the three legendary birds appear to be embodiments of {{wp|seasons}}, Zapdos represents {{wp|summer}}, while {{p|Articuno}} and {{p|Moltres}} represent {{wp|winter}} and {{wp|spring}}, respectively. {{wp|Autumn}} is however unrepresented.

Galarian Zapdos appears to be based on {{wp|ratite}}s, with {{wp|Kiwi (bird)|kiwis}} in particular matching its brown feathers and long beak. Due to its speed, it may also be based on a {{wp|roadrunner}}. Its powerful kicks might also draw influence from the {{wp|secretarybird}}, a mostly terrestrial bird that hunts by stomping and kicking its prey. Its legs could also be derived from the {{wp|English Pouter}}, a pigeon breed known for such. Its {{Shiny}} coloration is similar to Kantonian Zapdos's regular coloration.

====Name origin====
Zapdos is a combination of ''zap'' and ''dos'' (Spanish for two, indicating that it is the second in the series of [[Kanto]] [[legendary birds]]).<ref name=MonsterKids>Dockery, Daniel (October 4, 2022).
