'''Aerodactyl''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''プテラ''' ''Ptera'') is a dual-type {{2t|Rock|Flying}} [[Fossil]] {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It is revived from an [[Old Amber]]. While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Aerodactyl can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Aerodactyl''' using the [[Aerodactylite]].

==Biology==
Aerodactyl is a {{wp|reptile|reptilian}}, bipedal prehistoric {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that resembles a {{wp|pterosaur}} with several draconic features. It has small sharply pointed ears, narrow dark green eyes, a ridged snout, a gaping mouth, and a strong lower jaw full of serrated fangs. Its body is covered in light blue-gray skin and it has large, violet membranous wings. The clawed hands at the end of each wing allow it to grasp objects. There is a hump-like ridge with a spike on its back, and it has a strong tail with an arrow-shaped tip. Its talon-like feet have two toes in front and one in the back, and are capable of scooping up and tightly clutching its prey in flight.
 
Aerodactyl's serrated saw-like fangs and ferocious attitude were very imposing in its time. Its fangs can rip out throats and tear through the skin of any Pokémon to pieces, even {{type|Steel}} Pokémon. By spreading its wings, Aerodactyl is believed to have flown by gliding through the skies, freely letting out its high-pitched cries. However, it is slow to walk on land. It liked to nest in the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|mountains}}, where it enjoyed both safety and seclusion. Aerodactyl lived in prehistoric times, and was theorized to become extinct thanks to a giant meteor impact. It was restored in modern times using genetic material extracted from amber; some casualties occurred during these attempts. Even still, this restoration is not considered perfect.

===Forms===
Aerodactyl can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Aerodactyl.

As Mega Aerodactyl, its eyes turn bright green and parts of its body turn to stone, which some researchers believe to be its original appearance before fossilization. It grows larger and sprouts jagged black spiky rocks all over its body: five spikes at the wrist joint of each wing replacing its hands, three small spikes along its tail, one spike on each ear, and a long spike on its chin. The spike on its back and its rear talons have also become black and stony. Rocky plates cover its eyebrows and the corners of its jaw. Similar stone ornaments are present on its chest on its torso: two small ridges flanking a longer ridge. 

The power of [[Mega Evolution]] allows some of Aerodactyl's dormant genes to reawaken. Some scholars claim that Mega Aerodactyl is Aerodactyl's true appearance from prehistory before it was revived. Some of the rocks on Mega Aerodactyl's body are harder than diamond. Because of the burden of Mega Evolution, Mega Aerodactyl is fiercer and more irritable than before. As a result, Mega Aerodactyl attacks anything that moves.

In ''[[JN038|Restore and Renew!]]'', [[Goh]] found an [[Old Amber]] in the [[Pewter Museum of Science]], which was revived into an Aerodactyl due to Team Rocket's intervention. It went berserk as a result, but Goh caught it after calming it down.

In ''[[HS15|Putting the Air Back in Aerodactyl!]]'', an Aerodactyl was revived by [[Gary Oak]]. It seemed to enjoy eating a pear-like fruit that grew in the forests of an island. [[Team Rocket]] agents [[Butch]] and [[Cassidy]] wanted to steal this Aerodactyl and present it to [[Dr. Namba]], but were stopped by [[Gary's Umbreon]] and {{p|Dodrio}}, and the Aerodactyl itself, who sent the two Rockets flying with a {{m|Hyper Beam}}.

In ''[[DP017|Wild in the Streets]]'', Team Rocket accidentally revived an Aerodactyl from its fossil. Angered and confused, it terrorized [[Oreburgh City]]. It was eventually stopped by [[Dawn's Piplup]] and {{TP|Dawn|Buneary}} before [[Dr. Kenzo]] {{pkmn2|caught}} it

In ''[[XY125|A League of His Own!]]'', {{an|Trevor}} was revealed to have caught an Aerodactyl. It was used in his battle against [[Alain]] in the [[Lumiose Conference]], where it went up against {{TP|Alain|Charizard}} but was soon defeated.

==Trivia==
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta]], Aerodactyl was revived using a Wing Fossil, which formed a trio with the [[Helix Fossil]] and [[Dome Fossil]].
* Aerodactyl shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Arctovish}}, {{p|Arctozolt}}, {{p|Dracovish}}, and {{p|Dracozolt}}. They are all known as the Fossil Pokémon.
* Aerodactyl was [[List of references to Pokémon in science|the inspiration for the naming]] of ''{{wp|Aerodactylus}}'', a genus of {{wp|pterosaur}}s. The genus name was chosen in reference to Aerodactyl having traits derived from various pterosaur species.<ref>Vidovic, S. U. & Martill, D. M. (2014). "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4206445/ ''Pterodactylus scolopaciceps'' Meyer, 1860 (Pterosauria, Pterodactyloidea) from the Upper Jurassic of Bavaria, Germany: The Problem of Cryptic Pterosaur Taxa in Early Ontogeny]". PLOS ONE. 9 (10): e110646.</ref>
* Aerodactyl is the only Fossil Pokémon with a [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolved]] form.
** Prior to [[Generation VIII]], it was also the only Fossil Pokémon that can be obtained in any way other than breeding, reviving its Fossil, or from the {{pkmn|Dream World}}: it is available through an [[in-game trade]] in [[Generation II]], as a gift in [[Generation VII]], and is one of [[Hayley's trades]].
*** The trade in Generation II was removed in {{2v|HeartGold|SoulSilver}}, likely because the [[Old Amber]] could be obtained and revived in these games, unlike in Generation II.
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Aerodactyl was originally known as "Ptera", its Japanese name.
* Aerodactyl is the only Pokémon owned by [[Lance]] and [[Clair]] in the [[core series]] who is not a {{type|Dragon}} Pokémon nor a Pokémon belonging to the {{egg|Dragon}} Egg Group.
** This is likely due to pterosaurs being known as "winged dragons" (翼竜 ''yokuryū'') in Japanese, further explaining why it is called a "dragon" by an old man in [[Pewter Museum of Science]] in [[Generation I|Generations I]], {{gen|III}}, and {{gen|VII}}, as well as suggesting why its appearance is influenced by that of {{wp|wyvern}}s.
* Mega Aerodactyl has the highest base {{stat|Speed}} stat of all {{type|Rock}} Pokémon.
* Aerodactyl is one of four non-Hoenn Dex Pokémon available in [[Pokémon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire]]. The others are {{p|Chikorita}}, {{p|Cyndaquil}} and {{p|Totodile}}.
* Mega Aerodactyl has a unique base stat total of 615.
* Aerodactyl is the first Fossil Pokémon to have its {{pkmn|Egg}} shown in the {{pkmn|animated series}}.
* In the ''[[Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia]]'', Aerodactyl was stated to be the predecessor of birds. This, alongside many facts in the book, would be retconned by future content in the games, specifically by the introduction of [[Archeops]]. 

===Origin===
Aerodactyl's design may based on {{wp|Pterodactyloidea|pterodactyloids}}, a family of {{wp|pterosaur}}s that lived in the {{wp|Jurassic}} period. Its long tail, however, may be derived from {{wp|Rhamphorhynchoidea|rhamphorhynchids}}. Additionally, its pointed wings, spaded tail, and robust jaws give it the resemblance of a {{wp|dragon}}, specifically {{wp|wyvern}}s.

The rocks that appear on Mega Aerodactyl's body may be a reference to {{wp|atavism}} whereby an ancestral genetic trait reappears after having been lost through evolutionary change in previous generations. The rock on Mega Aerodactyl's chin resembles a {{wp|goatee}}.

====Name origin====
Aerodactyl may be a combination of ἀέρος ''aéros'' ({{wp|Greek language|Greek}} for ''air'') or aeroplane, and ''{{wp|Pterosaur|pterodactyl}}''.

Ptera may be derived from ''{{wp|pterosaur}}'' or ''{{wp|Pteranodon}}''.
