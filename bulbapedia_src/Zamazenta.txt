'''Zamazenta''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ザマゼンタ''' ''Zamazenta'') is a {{type|Fighting}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation VIII]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Zamazenta has a second {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Zamazenta|form}} activated by giving it a [[Rusted Shield]] to hold. Its original form, '''Hero of Many Battles''', will then become the dual-type {{2t|Fighting|Steel}} '''Crowned Shield'''.

Zamazenta is the [[game mascot]] of [[Pokémon Sword and Shield|Pokémon Shield]], appearing on its boxart in its Crowned Shield form. It is a member of the [[Legendary heroes|legendary heroes]] with {{p|Zacian}}.

It is associated with {{p|Eternatus}}, playing a role in stopping the [[Darkest Day]].

==Biology==
[[File:Zacian Zamazenta dormant.png|thumb|left|250px|Zamazenta's dormant state (left)]]
In its Hero of Many Battles form, Zamazenta is a large magenta lupine {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with yellow eyes, a bulky frame, and a ponytail on its head. Its tail and ponytail are a deep blue; it also has deep blue accents on its neck and forelimbs. There are battle scars on its shoulders, hips, side, and eye, which reveal a tan coloration under the red fur. Half of its right ear is also missing. Its head and neck have thick fur resembling a shield.

It is believed to be the younger sibling or the rival of {{p|Zacian}}. In the past, Zamazenta was feared and respected by the people of [[Galar]]. 3000 years ago, It worked together with [[First kings of Galar|two young humans]] to save the region from {{p|Eternatus}} and the [[Darkest Day]] it created, defeating the Gigantic Pokémon and forcing it back into slumber, which also caused pieces of its body imbued with its power to rain down throughout Galar in the form of [[Wishing Piece|Wishing Pieces]] and [[Wishing Star|Wishing Stars]]. It can also turn itself into a statue and slumber for eons alongside Zacian in the [[Slumbering Weald]]. Zamazenta can also cast illusions, including a projection of itself, even while it slumbers. Additionally, it is capable of flying. Even though it is not capable of [[Dynamax]]ing, Zamazenta may still go berserk when bombarded by [[Galar particle|Galar particles]]. As years passed, both Zamazenta and Zacian were forgotten by history, however, [[Sonia|Professor Sonia]] proved their existence by writing her first book: "[[Sonia's Book|Galar: A History]]", which details the discovery she and the [[Player character|player]] had in [[Stow-on-Side]].

Zamazenta is also the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Dauntless Shield}} as an [[Ability]].

===Forms===
[[File:Zamazenta Behemoth Bash shield.png|thumb|right|250px|Zamazenta's [[Rusted Shield|shield]] transforms so it can use {{m|Behemoth Bash}}]]
Zamazenta has two forms: Hero of Many Battles and Crowned Shield.

Zamazenta can change to its Crowned Shield form in battle by [[Held item|wielding]] the [[Rusted Shield]], it then absorbs metal particles in the air and uses them to form a golden armor over its body and transform the Rusted Shield into a larger, golden shield.

The Crowned Shield form causes Zamazenta to generate a set of golden armor covering the front of its body like a shield; although the side portions normally cover its forelimbs, they can slide forward to allow Zamazenta to use {{m|Behemoth Bash}} or protect itself from frontal attacks more effectively. Its ponytail also grows to cover most of its backside.

Crowned Shield is said to be Zamazenta's true form, and it is at its full power in this form. It has the ability to deflect any attacks with the shield that serves as its mane. When together with Zacian in their Crowned forms, it can negate the mysterious power of [[Eternamax]] {{p|Eternatus}}, which prevents opposing Pokémon from attacking it.

Zamazenta's regal and majestic movements enable it to overwhelm opponents who face off against it. Zamazenta uses its golden shield to fend off attacks and as a weapon. The shield has tremendous strength, capable of withstanding scratches from the sharp claws of {{type|Dragon}} Pokémon and attacks from [[Dynamax]] Pokémon. Its resolve does not falter, and it charges at its enemies head on. By bashing with its full might, it is said that Zamazenta's power can cause cracks in the land, and that the resulting shockwaves can knock out hundreds of enemies. According to legends, in this form, it was known as the "Fighting Master's Shield" due to its Typing and weapon.

Crowned Shield Zamazenta is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Behemoth Bash}}. By using Behemoth Bash, it is said to be able to bore holes through mountains.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon-galar-region/zamazenta/ Zamazenta | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref>

===Form data===
Zamazenta has two forms, Hero of Many Battles and Crowned Shield, which change its appearance, [[stat]]s, [[type]], and [[cry]]. Zamazenta will always be in its Hero of Many Battles form outside of {{pkmn|battle}}. In battle, Zamazenta will be in its Crowned Shield form if it holds a [[Rusted Shield]]. In this form, Zamazenta gains {{t|Steel}} as a secondary type and has increased {{stat|Defense}} and {{stat|Special Defense}}, at the expense of slightly decreased {{stat|Speed}}. Additionally, if Zamazenta knows {{m|Iron Head}}, the move will be replaced with {{m|Behemoth Bash}}.

* Zamazenta and {{p|Zacian}}'s Hero of Many Battles forms have the same stat distribution.

===Origin===
Zamazenta may be based on {{wp|King Arthur}}'s shield, known as {{wp|Excalibur#Arthur's other weapons|Wynebgwrthucher}} or Pridwen. It may also be based on the {{wp|Knights of the Round Table}}, characters under Arthur's order said to work with him to protect the British kingdom. Its relationship with {{p|Zacian}} may reference the relationship between King Arthur and his sister {{wp|Morgan le Fay}}. It otherwise resembles a {{wp|wolf}}, an animal once native to {{wp|Great Britain}} and an important heraldic symbol for noble families during the {{wp|Middle Ages}}. It also resembles the {{wp|Iron Wolf (character)|Iron Wolf}} of ancient {{wp|Lithuanian mythology}}. The armored plating on Zamazenta is similar to that of a {{wp|barding}}, a form of body armor worn by warhorses during the {{wp|Late Middle Ages}}.

The story of Zacian and Zamazenta retreating to the Slumbering Weald to recover from their wounds, and their return in the present day to save Galar, parallels the legend of {{wp|King Arthur's messianic return}}.

Zamazenta's shield's ability to resist any attack, with Zacian's sword being able to cut through anything, could be an example of an {{wp|irresistible force paradox}}. One of the most famous examples of this in folklore includes the Chinese tale of a peddler selling a spear and a shield with similar properties, only to be asked what would happen if the two items were to be used against one another. Another example tells of the Greek hunting hound {{wp|Laelaps (mythology)|Laelaps}}, which always caught its prey, being set upon {{wp|Teumessian fox}}, which could never be caught, and had to be turned into constellations to prevent the paradox.

Additionally, the shape of its shining shield while using Behemoth Bash may reference {{wp|Sköll}}, a wolf that chases after the Sun in Norse mythology.
