It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

==Biology==
[[File:Fezandipiti mesmerizing pheromones.png|thumb|250px|left|Fezandipiti releasing its pheromones]]
Fezandipiti is an avian Pokémon with a small head, a short beak with a magenta tip, and a long neck and legs. Its plumage is primarily black, with white on its head and neck, and bronze accents on its face, collar, and wing tips. It stands atop a pair of long slender bronze-colored legs having three-toed feet with sharp claws, and its tail consists of a long train of bronze-colored feathers ending in forked tips that gently curl outwards. A single white stripe accents each of its legs and tail. A crest of black feathers resembling a cap sits atop Fezandipiti's head, with golden feathers sticking out resembling a royal crown. A pair of magenta plumes also sits just above each of Fezandipiti's eyes like eyebrows and extend like long streamers with forked ends. Hanging from Fezandipiti's chest is a pair of magenta {{a|Toxic Chain|toxic chains}}, protruding from a shawl-like feature that wraps its body. Fezandipiti is a male-only species with no female counterpart.

Fezandipiti, together with Okidogi and Munkidori, are known as the [[Loyal Three]], the heroes of Kitakami. The three are beloved by the people of Kitakami as heroes that once protected the land from the "evil ogre",<ref>"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3cA6VSgdj8 Watch the New Trailer for The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero!]" [https://www.youtube.com/c/pokemon The Official Pokémon YouTube Channel]. ''YouTube''.</ref> and stone statues bearing their likenesses were made by the people as an expression of their gratitude right where the three had been buried.<ref>(February 27, 2023). "[https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/news/new_pokemon/ Introducing the Legendary Pokémon You’ll Meet in This DLC]." Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet Official Website</ref> According to locals, worshipping Fezandipiti leads to both good luck and serendipitous fortune. Even with its greedy and arrogant personality, Fezandipiti has great relationships with its teammates, talking to each other in private and acting together to defeat their opponents. By consuming the [[mochi|Kitakami Mochis]], Fezandipiti can become a [[Titan Pokémon|Titanic Pokémon]].

{{Spoilers}}
In myth, it is said that Fezandipiti was once [[List of disputed and unidentified Pokémon#Original Loyal Three|a Pokémon with short, dull feathers]]. A wish to be beautiful led it to meet the [[Mythical Pokémon]] {{p|Pecharunt}} which, in need of retainers in its journey to [[Kitakami]], used its [[mochi|Binding Mochi]] and {{a|Toxic Chain|toxic chains}} to tame and transform Fezandipiti. This resulted in the toxic chain being wrapped around its waist, chaining Fezandipiti to Pecharunt's will.<ref>'''Map Mission Guide:''' ''"Locals believe worshiping Fezandipiti will lead to good luck and serendipitous happenings. Fezandipiti was once a Pokémon with short, dull feathers, but a wish to be beautiful led it to gain an exquisite appearance."'' ([[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet]]: [[The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero]] Part 1: [[The Teal Mask]])</ref> Fezandipiti transformed, enhancing its capabilities and giving it a stunning appearance and a lovely voice. It possesses powerful pheromones, capable of captivating both humans and Pokémon with a beat of its glossy wings to scatter them through the air.

==Trivia==
* All of the [[level]]s at which Fezandipiti learns its [[move]]s, aside from level 1, are multiples of 8. It shares this trait with {{p|Pecharunt}} and the rest of the [[Loyal Three]].

===Origin===
Fezandipiti may be based on the {{wp|copper pheasant}} (山鳥 ''yamadori'' in Japanese), a pheasant {{wp|endemism|endemic}} to Japan and chosen as the prefectural bird of {{wp|Akita Prefecture}} of the {{wp|Tōhoku region}} (which [[Kitakami]] draws inspiration from). Both the male and the female of the copper pheasant have a similar brown color, but the male has a brighter hue with coppery luster.

Fezandipiti's plumage resembles a {{wp|kimono}}, its crest resembles a collection of ''{{wp|kanzashi}}'', and its white face is reminiscent of {{wp|oshiroi}}. These combined with its looks being described as beautiful and its voice being described as lovely could point to {{wp|geisha}}—female Japanese performance artists—as a possible inspiration. Given that Fezandipiti is male-only, its design may also hint at male {{wp|kabuki}} performers who assumed the role of female characters (particularly {{wp|oiran}}) on stage and also used oshiroi. Its crest and plumage also bears resemblance to the {{wp|hoatzin}}, whose consumption of toxic plants and emission of malodor may in turn inspired its {{type|Poison}}. It may also have been inspired by the mythical [[wp:Zhenniao|zhenniao]], a colorful bird with poisonous feathers from southern China.

{{p|Pecharunt}} and its [[Loyal Three]] of {{p|Okidogi}}, {{p|Munkidori}}, and Fezandipiti, and their relationship to {{p|Ogerpon}}, may reference the Japanese folktale of ''{{wp|Momotarō}}''. The tale relates the titular Momotarō, a boy born from inside a peach, who traveled alongside a talking dog, monkey, and pheasant to fight a band of ''{{wp|oni}}'' (a Japanese folkloric creature commonly equated to ogres in translations). The chains binding the Loyal Three may be based on {{wp|shimenawa}}, woven ropes used in Shinto purification rituals; on Fezandipiti, the chain resembles an ''{{wp|Obi (sash)|obi}}'' belt used to tie a kimono, such as a knotted ''maruobi''.

====Name origin====
Fezandipiti may be a combination of ''{{wp|pheasant}}'' and ''serendipity'' (an unexpected but auspicious happening).

Kichikigisu may be a combination of 吉 ''kichi'' (fortune) and 雉子 ''kigisu'' (archaic reading of pheasant).
