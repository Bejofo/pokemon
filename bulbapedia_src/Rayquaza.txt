'''Rayquaza''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''レックウザ''' ''Rayquaza'') is a dual-type {{2t|Dragon|Flying}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation III]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Rayquaza can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Rayquaza''' if it knows {{m|Dragon Ascent}}, but only if it is not holding a [[Z-Crystal]].

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Form data|Game data&rarr;Form data]] for these details.)

Rayquaza is the game mascot of {{game|Emerald}}, appearing on the boxart of the game. It serves to end the conflict between {{p|Kyogre}} and {{p|Groudon}} when [[Team Magma]]'s leader [[Maxie]] and [[Team Aqua]]'s leader [[Archie]] awakened them.

Along with Kyogre and Groudon, Rayquaza is one of the [[super-ancient Pokémon]], often viewed as their [[Legendary leader|leader]] by fans. In {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, it plays an important role during the [[Delta Episode]]. It is associated with {{p|Deoxys}}.

==Biology==
Rayquaza is a large, green, serpentine {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that also resembles a missile. It has red-tipped, rudder-like wings on its shoulders and down its body, and similarly patterned fins on the tip of its tail. Yellow ring-like symbols run across the length of Rayquaza's body and it has an additional yellow ring on top of its head. Rayquaza has two limbs with three-clawed hands, and two long, flat, horn-like structures on its head, with two shorter horns along its jawline. It has small, yellow eyes with black pupils, prominent pink gums, and two discernible fangs in its upper jaw.

Rayquaza has a strong and endless desire to do heroic deeds for the [[Pokémon world]].<ref>[[Legendary and Mythical Guidebook: Deluxe Edition]]: :''"Rayquaza has a never-ending appetite for doing what right."''</ref> Rayquaza is said to be equal to both Groudon and Kyogre.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150209222143/http://www.pokemonrubysapphire.com/en-us/pokemon/legendary-pokemon/the-legends-of-hoenn-continue | The Legends of Hoenn Continue]</ref> For that reason, it is the only one who can halt the endless battles of the other two [[super-ancient Pokémon]], by overpowering them and forcing both back into their slumber, even in their [[Primal Reversion|Primal Forms]].<ref>[[Wallace]]: ''"Somewhere, there is a super-ancient Pokémon named Rayquaza. It's said that it was Rayquaza that becalmed the two combatants in the distant past."'' ({{game|Emerald}})</ref><ref>[[Zinnia]]: ''"That was when, as if drawn by the brilliance, a Pokémon that shone in a blazing emerald hue descended from the heavens... That Pokémon was none other than Rayquaza. Rayquaza's power overwhelmed that of the two Primal Pokémon, and peace returned to the world."'' ([[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire]])</ref>. It is also the only one that can restore the order of nature that they've disrupted. Rayquaza is said to have lived for hundreds of millions of years in the {{wp|ozone layer}}, where it feeds on water and other particles. There, it feeds on [[Meteorite|meteoroids]], which includes [[Mega Stone]]s and even {{p|Minior}}. It also loves [[Rayquaza Treat]]s made by [[Snacksworth]], who once encountered it in the past. Rayquaza is {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Rare Pokémon|rarely}} seen by people; even in flight, its appearance is indistinguishable from that of a meteor. For living in the ozone layer, it can breathe in outer space.

Rayquaza possesses some of the strongest attack power out of any Pokémon, and can easily summon {{m|Hurricane|cyclones}} to overwhelm its opponents. {{m|Dragon Ascent|It can soar into the sky and drop out into its foes at high speeds}}, causing huge damage. Thanks to its weather-manipulation powers, {{a|Air Lock|it can eliminate weather effects}}. Rayquaza was worshiped by the [[Draconid people]] as the savior of the region since ancient times. Thus, they built the [[Sky Pillar]] to honor it. Additionally, it can be summoned atop Sky Pillar by multiple [[Key Stone]]s. In [[Pokémon Adventures]], the Draconids referred to it as their "Dragon Lord". It is one of the longest-lived Pokémon species. Inside its body lies an organ that contains the same [[Infinity Energy|power]] as a [[Mega Stone]], which was named the "mikado organ" (Japanese: '''ミカド{{tt|器官|きかん}}''') by a [[Devon Corporation]] scientist.

Rayquaza possesses a strong rivalry with {{p|Deoxys}}, an extraterrestrial Pokémon that repeatedly invades its territory, with the two often clashing with each other in space. This is depicted in the movie ''[[M07|Destiny Deoxys]]'' and in the games [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|Omega Ruby, Alpha Sapphire]], and {{pkmn|Masters EX}}.

Rayquaza is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Dragon Ascent}}. It is also the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Air Lock}} as an [[Ability]].

===Forms===
[[File:Destroying the meteoroid Rayquaza ORAS.png|thumb|right|<!--APNG, do not set a thumbnail size-->Mega Rayquaza destroying [[Grand Meteor Delta|a meteor]]]]
Rayquaza can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Rayquaza.

Thanks to Rayquaza's mikado organ, by consuming meteoroids in the stratosphere, the organ can be filled with enough [[Infinity Energy|energy]] for Rayquaza to [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] without a [[Mega Stone]] and, as seen in {{aniseries|XY}}, even a [[Key Stone]].

As Mega Rayquaza, its body becomes longer and gains more features. Its head becomes longer with the Δ (delta) symbol appearing on its forehead. Rayquaza's eyes now contain yellow pupils with red irises, and black, {{wp|shichishito}}-shaped markings trail behind its eyes. Its red lips and teeth become gold, and the gold lines connect to those on its lower horns, which take on a broad, triangular shape. At the outer edges of its lower horns are long, golden, glowing tendrils that each extend to a green, fin-like structure; these tendrils have ring patterns that strongly resemble the yellow markings running along the length of Rayquaza's normal form. While in flight, these tendrils give Mega Rayquaza a triangular profile. Its two upper horns become longer with a gold line running over them in a V shape, and each upper horn has another glowing tendril that ends in a circular shape with a spike. Along the length of its body are golden, glowing orbs placed where its ring patterns used to be. The chin, part of the neck, and parts of its serpentine body are changed to the color black. The fins running along its body are now marked with gold lines; the fins on its tail become entirely yellow and substantially longer. Particles stream from the long tendrils that extend from its jutting jaw; these particles can control the density and humidity of the air, allowing Mega Rayquaza to manipulate the weather. Its green hide sparkles with an emerald-like quality.<ref name="Mega">[https://web.archive.org/web/20150202050239/http://www.pokemonrubysapphire.com/en-us/pokemon/legendary-pokemon/mega-rayquaza | Mega Rayquaza]</ref>

Mega Rayquaza was said to have been born from humanity's wish for salvation, channeled through the Key Stone of a Draconid Lorekeeper. Rayquaza is the first recorded Pokémon to achieve [[Mega Evolution]] and is at its full power when in the Mega Evolved state. Thanks to its weather-manipulating powers, {{a|Delta Stream|it can change the weather to eliminate}} all of the [[Flying (type)|Flying]] [[type]]'s weaknesses. Mega Rayquaza is so powerful that it can undo the [[Primal Reversion|primal forms]] of {{p|Groudon}} and {{p|Kyogre}}. It's also capable of destroying [[Grand Meteor Delta|meteors bigger than itself]]. It has been referred to as "Δ (Delta)".

Mega Rayquaza is the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Delta Stream}} as an [[Ability]].

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
* {{g|Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire}}: Rayquaza is the focus of the third and final Bonus Field. It can only be challenged after capturing {{p|Groudon}} or {{p|Kyogre}} and will then join the circuit of bonus fields. Rayquaza will bounce along from left to right, allowing the ball to roll under it if it is up. It will sometimes use {{m|Thunder}} to paralyze the ball if it is not moving fast enough, though it does stay still while it is unleashing the attack. Rayquaza will also sometimes use {{m|ExtremeSpeed}} to create two tornadoes that cause the ball to fly up into the air for several seconds if contact is made. Rayquaza must be hit 15 times in three minutes to win. After beating the round twice, Rayquaza will be captured.
* [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team]]: Rayquaza acts as the final boss, living on the [[Sky Tower]]. After it is defeated, Rayquaza helps save the {{pkmn|world (Mystery Dungeon)|world}} from a meteor. After the credits roll, the player can re-battle Rayquaza to recruit it.
* {{vg|Pokémon Ranger}}: Rayquaza can be captured in a bonus mission after the credits.
* [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness]]: Rayquaza is the guardian of the [[Seven Treasures|Sky Melodica]].
* [[PokéPark Wii: Pikachu's Adventure]]: Rayquaza is the leader of the [[Granite Zone|Granite]] and [[Flower Zone]]s. He's in charge of {{DL|Attraction (PokéPark)|Rayquaza's Balloon Panic}}.
* {{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}}: Rayquaza first appears early into the game, fleeing to space in fear of [[Dark Matter]]'s influence. When Dark Matter attempts to take the [[Tree of Life]] to space, Rayquaza and Deoxys use their energy to try and slow its ascent from above, with Rayquaza even Mega Evolving. Ultimately, when Dark Matter regenerates itself for the first time, it unleashes even more energy, turning both Rayquaza and Deoxys to stone. At the conclusion of the event, Rayquaza turns back to normal and takes residence at [[Dragon Gate]] and guards the {{DL|Looplet|Wind Looplet}}.

====Major appearances====
=====[[Rayquaza (M07)]]=====
Rayquaza debuted in ''[[M07|Destiny Deoxys]]''. It fought {{OBP|Deoxys|M07}}, believing it was invading the Sky High Pokémon's territory when Deoxys was in fact looking for its friend, another Deoxys.

====={{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (XY series)|Rayquaza|Rayquaza (''Pokémon the Series: XY'')}}=====
In ''[[XYS02|Mega Evolution Special II]]'', a Rayquaza showed up and [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolved]]. [[Alain]] and {{Steven}} tried to battle it, but they were quickly defeated by the Sky High Pokémon. In ''[[XYS03|Mega Evolution Special III]]'', it tried to stop the destructive battle between [[Primal Reversion|Primal]] [[Super-ancient Pokémon (XY series)#Groudon|Groudon]] and Primal [[Super-ancient Pokémon (XY series)#Kyogre|Kyogre]] as both were trying to obtain the [[Giant Rock]], and eventually succeeded.

=====[[Black Rayquaza]]=====
In ''[[HZ006|The Ancient Poké Ball]]'', a {{Shiny}} Rayquaza emerged from [[Roy]]'s [[Ancient Poké Ball]] before flying away. It was later revealed that it was one of [[Lucius]]'s Pokémon and one of the [[Six Heroes]]. Finding it again provided Roy with inspiration to start traveling with the [[Rising Volt Tacklers]].

=====Other=====
In ''[[DP043|Malice In Wonderland!]]'', {{an|Cynthia}} appeared to own a Rayquaza, but it was only an illusion created by {{p|Mismagius}}. Whenever Mismagius fuses with Rayquaza, it becomes the same color as the Mismagius, making it look like a Shiny Rayquaza.

Rayquaza made its physical animated series debut in ''[[DP142|Where No Togepi Has Gone Before!]]''. It used {{m|Hyper Beam}} on the rocket ship {{Ash}}, {{ashfr}}, and {{TRT}} were on, presumably in order to protect its territory from them.

In [[BWS02]], {{an|Iris}} saw a Rayquaza and decided to follow it and see where it would go next.

In ''[[M18|Hoopa and the Clash of Ages]]'', a Shiny Rayquaza capable of Mega Evolving was summoned alongside {{p|Latios}} and {{p|Latias}} by {{an|Hoopa}} to protect it from the shadow {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Hoopa|Hoopa Unbound}}. The trio protected Hoopa from the shadow Hoopa and its reinforcements, [[Primal Reversion|Primal]] {{p|Groudon}}, Primal {{p|Kyogre}}, {{p|Dialga}}, {{p|Palkia}}, {{p|Giratina}}, and {{p|Kyurem}}, in [[Dahara City]]. Eventually, the {{pkmn|battle}} ended after the shadow Hoopa was sealed in a [[Prison Bottle]], and Rayquaza departed for its home.

In ''[[SM124|Living on the Cutting Edge!]]'', a Rayquaza was battling {{p|Deoxys}} in outer space. The battle accidentally caused one of the meteors to head towards [[Alola]], though it was ultimately cut up by a {{DL|Ultra Beasts (anime)|Kartana}}, saving the [[region]] from harm.

====Minor appearances====
In the opening sequence of ''[[M09|Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea]]'', a Rayquaza was captured by [[Team Rocket]] operatives and experimented on.

A Rayquaza appeared in the opening sequence of ''[[M08|Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]]''.

A Rayquaza appeared in the opening sequence of ''[[M13|Zoroark: Master of Illusions]]''.

In ''[[SM079|Showering the World with Love!]]'', {{Ash}} and {{ashcl}} saw a Rayquaza in the sky at [[Starfall Hill]] after saying goodbye to {{p|Minior}}.

A Rayquaza appeared in a fantasy in ''[[JN032|Time After Time!]]''.

A Rayquaza appeared in ''[[JN046|Getting More Than You Battled For!]]''.

A silhouetted Rayquaza appeared in a fantasy in ''[[JN053|Healing the Healer!]]''.

===Pokémon Adventures===
{{main|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)#Rayquaza|Rayquaza (Adventures)}}
Rayquaza debuted in ''[[PS258|Rayquaza Redemption I]]'', where [[Norman]] sought it out to stop the battle between {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Groudon}} and {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Kyogre}} in [[Sootopolis City]], using {{adv|Wally}}'s help to gain access to its sealed chamber inside [[Sky Pillar]]. While Rayquaza's power alone was insufficient to stop the battle, {{adv|Ruby}} was able to combine it with the powers of the [[Red Orb|Red]] and [[Blue Orb]]s, successfully stopping the conflict. Afterwards, Rayquaza broke free of the weakened Norman's control and fled. In the {{MangaArc|Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire}}, Ruby and Norman once again sought to use Rayquaza to avert a crisis, this time to destroy a [[Grand Meteor Delta|giant meteoroid]] that was threatening the planet. [[Zinnia]] also wanted to use Rayquaza for the same purpose, believing herself to be the one who should carry out the task. However, after Rayquaza rejected her, it befell to Ruby and {{adv|Sapphire}} to ride Rayquaza to space and [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] it in order to destroy the meteoroid.

In this [[canon]], Rayquaza was once captured by the [[Pokémon Association]] in order to study it and create an artificial [[Jade Orb|Green Orb]] in order to control it, but the artifact was never fully completed before Rayquaza escaped its imprisonment.

===Pokémon Pocket Monsters===
A Rayquaza appears in ''[[PMRS34|Pokémon Task Force In Action!!]]'', where {{PPM|Red}}, {{TP|Red|Clefairy}}, {{PPM|Red's Pikachu|Pikachu}}, and {{TP|Red|Tyrogue}} try to stop it from destroying a city.

===Let's Play the Pokémon Card Game XY!===
[[Manabu Kadoo|Manabu]] was seen with a Rayquaza.

===Movie adaptations===
{{main|Rayquaza (M07)}}
Rayquaza plays a major role in the {{ma|Destiny Deoxys|manga adaptation}} of ''[[M07|Destiny Deoxys]]''.

A Shiny Rayquaza appears in ''{{ma|Hoopa and the Clash of Ages}}''.

===Pocket Monsters DP===

==In the TCG==
{{main|Rayquaza (TCG)}}

==Other appearances==
===[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]===
[[File:Rayquaza Brawl.png|thumb|200px|Rayquaza in Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]
Rayquaza appears in [[The Subspace Emissary]] mode as a boss. After {{smw|Diddy Kong}} lands in {{sbw|The Lake}}, Rayquaza lunges out of the water and grabs him, angry at being disrupted. Before it can further attack, {{smw|Fox McCloud|Fox}} ejects out of his ship, which had crashed and been destroyed by Rayquaza earlier, and rescues Diddy Kong. Enraged, Rayquaza attacks Fox with {{m|Dragon Pulse}}, but Fox {{sbw|Reflector|reflects}} its attack back at it, sending it reeling back into the water. Rayquaza soon launches back out and engages in battle against Fox and Diddy Kong.  Even though it is a very powerful Legendary Pokemon, they still manage to defeat it.

Like all other Subspace Emissary bosses, Rayquaza is later battled again in {{sbw|The Great Maze}}, and can be fought in the {{sbw|Boss Battles}} mode after the latter is unlocked. Its attacks in battle include {{m|ExtremeSpeed}}, {{m|Thunder}}, {{m|Dig}}{{tt|*|Can't learn this in the core series games}}, {{m|Iron Tail}}, and {{m|Fly}}.

Rayquaza being found/battled at the lake contrasts how it canonically is supposed to live in the ozone layer.

====Trophy information====
''A Sky High Pokémon. It normally resides high up in the ozone layer where it flies endlessly, so it is rarely seen. However, when {{p|Groudon}} and {{p|Kyogre}} began to fight, it appeared to calm them down. It has the ability {{a|Air Lock}}, which blocks all weather-condition effects. It has exceedingly strong abilities, and its attack power is especially remarkable.''

===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for Wii U]]===
[[File:Kalos Pokémon League Dragonmark Chamber SSB4WU.png|thumb|left|250px|Rayquaza in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U]]
Rayquaza appears as an occasional stage hazard in the {{DL|Pokémon League (Kalos)|Dragonmark Chamber}} of the {{st|Kalos Pokémon League}} stage. Appearing rarely, it flies across the stage at various angles, dealing damage to fighters. Its path is shown briefly by lightning before it appears, giving players time to avoid it.

====Trophy information====
''This Dragon- and Flying-type Pokemon usually dwells high in the ozone layer, so it can't be seen from the ground. In the Kalos Pokemon League stage, it occasionally flies at great speed through the Elite Four's Dragon-type chamber, where any fighters in its path will be damaged and launched with great force.''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Rayquaza appears as a {{sbw|Spirits (characters)|Spirit}}, as well as retaining its rare appearance in the Dragonmark Chamber on the {{st|Kalos Pokémon League}} stage. Rayquaza's Spirit Battle uses a Ridley puppet fighter and is fought on the Kalos Pokémon League stage's Dragonmark Chamber, which features Rayquaza as a stage element. During the battle, heavy winds are immediately in effect, referencing Mega Rayquaza's ability, Delta Stream, which creates strong winds.

==Trivia==
[[File:0384Rayquaza-Shiny.png|thumb|200x200px|Promotional artwork of Shiny Rayquaza]]
* Mega Rayquaza has the highest base {{stat|Attack}} and {{stat|Special Attack}} stats and the highest base stat total of all {{type|Dragon}} and {{type|Flying}} Pokémon.
* Mega Rayquaza is the tallest Mega Evolved Pokémon.
** It is also the [[List of Pokémon by height|tallest]] {{type|Flying}} Pokémon.
* Rayquaza's catch rate was raised from its original value of 3 to 45 in {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}. This is likely due to it being a required capture during the [[Delta Episode]] storyline of that game. Its catch rate was later reverted from 45 back to 3 in {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}.
* Rayquaza was the most voted Pokémon of all pre-[[Generation V]] Pokémon in the {{pmin|South Korea|Korean}} [[Pokémon Global Link]] [[List of Pokémon Global Link promotions/Pokémon#Rayquaza|promotion]] poll.
** Rayquaza was also the most voted on the {{DL|List of local Japanese event Pokémon distributions in Generation V|15th Anniversary Rayquaza|15th anniversary poll}}, which was for the [[game mascot]]s of the [[core series]] games, making it Japan's favorite game mascot.
* {{Shiny}} Rayquaza is likely the most promoted Shiny Pokémon. Its Shiny form has been [[Mystery Gift|distributed]] via [[Event Pokémon|events]] 11 times, has appeared in 9 [[Pokémon Trading Card Game|TCG]] prints, serves as a featured character in ''[[M18|Hoopa and the Clash of Ages]]'' and a [[Black Rayquaza|recurring character]] in {{aniseries|HZ}}, and has made appearances in various [[Spin-off Pokémon games|spin-off games]] and {{pkmn|merchandise}}.
* Rayquaza is misspelled as "Rayquayza" at the {{player}} select screen of {{g|Team Turbo}}.
** However, this typo does not affect the minigames [[Charizard's Crossword Challenge]] and [[Mudkip's Word Finder]], because they don't use Rayquaza or any other Pokémon without evolutionary relatives as of [[Generation III]].
* Rayquaza is the only Pokémon capable of Mega Evolving that does not require a [[Mega Stone]] to do so in the games.
** It is, therefore, the only Pokémon that can have a different held item (apart from [[Z-Crystal]]s) while Mega Evolved, since Mega Stones cannot be taken off their proper holder during battle.
** It is also the only Pokémon not to have the message "(The opposing) <Pokémon>'s <[[Mega Stone]]> is reacting to its [[Key Stone]]!" when it Mega Evolves. Instead, it has the message "<player>'s fervent wish has reached Rayquaza!".
* Mega Rayquaza is tied with {{p|Mewtwo}}'s Mega Evolutions for the highest base stat total of all Pokémon, with 780, excluding the non-playable Eternamax {{p|Eternatus}}.
** This also makes it the only Pokémon with a base stat total above 720 that doesn't require a specific held item.
* Rayquaza was designed by [[Hironobu Yoshida]].<ref>[https://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/worlds/2014/info/vips/ 2014 Pokémon World Championships VIPs | The Official Pokémon Website]</ref>
* In the [[Pokémon of the Year]] poll held by The Pokémon Company in 2020, Rayquaza was voted the most popular [[Generation III]] Pokémon, receiving 60,939 votes. It was also the eighth-most popular Pokémon overall.
** It was also voted as the most popular [[Legendary Pokémon]], as well as being the only Legendary to make the top ten results.

===Origin===
Rayquaza's design may be based on the {{wp|Chinese dragon}} and the {{wp|Lindworm}}. Its role is similar to that of {{wp|Ziz}} in Hebrew legends. It matches the description of the Aztec god {{wp|Quetzalcoatl}}, who was depicted as a flying serpent and created the boundary between the earth (including the oceans) and the sky. The markings on its body may be inspired from The Nazca Lines. Its trait of being capable of inhabiting the skies, and living there while subsisting on nothing but dew and particles for centuries, also bears aspects of the legendary Chinese xian hermit sages and East Asian dragons, specifically Japanese dragons, who are commonly depicted with three claws, as opposed to four in Chinese dragons.

Rayquaza being a dragon coming from the cosmic space on earth might take inspiration from {{wp|meteorite}}s, the {{wp|Draconids}} meteor shower named after {{wp|Draco (constellaton)|Draco constellation}}, or the comet that gave the name {{wp|Uther Pendragon|Pendragon}} to the legendary King of the Britons. The yellow marking on Mega Rayquaza's head, as well as its overall appearance when its chains are linked to its tail when flying, is similar to the Greek letter {{wp|delta}}, likely signifying its connection to the [[Delta Episode]] from {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}.

====Name origin====
Rayquaza may be derived from 裂空 ''rekkū'' (sky-rending), a word appearing in various media and merchandise that featured Rayquaza. The latter half may be derived from 座 ''za'' (seat), relating to compounds such as 星座 ''seiza'' (constellation) and 王座 ''ōza'' (throne). It may also involve רָקִיעַ ''rāqī́aʿ'' (Hebrew for {{wp|firmament}}), ''{{wp|ray}}'', and ''{{wp|quasar}}''.

Rayquaza's mikado organ refers to 帝 ''mikado'' (emperor), another name for the {{wp|Emperor of Japan}}.
