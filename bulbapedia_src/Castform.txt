'''Castform''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ポワルン''' ''Powalen'') is a {{type|Normal}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation III]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Castform changes [[#Form data|forms]] depending on the current [[weather]].
* During any weather not listed below or outside of battle, it will be in its '''Normal''' form and will be {{type|Normal}}.
* During {{weather|harsh sunlight}}, it will be in its '''Sunny Form''' and will be {{type|Fire}}.
* During {{weather|rain}}, it will be in its '''Rainy Form''' and will be {{type|Water}}.
* During {{weather|hail}}, it will be in its '''Snowy Form''' and will be {{type|Ice}}.

(Refer to [[#Form data|Game data&rarr;Form data]] for more details.)

==Biology==
Castform is an {{pkmn2|artificial}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that changes appearance and attitude based on the weather. Its body is made of cells exactly like those of water molecules, causing its cellular structure to be chemically altered by temperature and humidity. Though not of its free will, Castform uses this ability to protect its tiny body. In its Normal form, it resembles a plain, gray cloud with a single wisp extending from the top of its head.

Regardless of the form it takes, it will always have a large, spherical head and a lighter-colored mask-like marking over its eyes. Various experiments were conducted to change its form in artificial conditions, but all have failed. In [[Generation III]], {{m|Weather Ball}} was its [[signature move]]. Despite its man-made origins, it can be found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|grassland areas}}.

Castform is the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Forecast}} as an [[Ability]].

===Forms===
Castform has three alternate forms: Sunny Form, Rainy Form, and Snowy Form.

Under harsh sunlight, it takes on its Sunny Form. Its lower half becomes pure white, while the head turns orange has develops small orange spheres around it. This gives it the overall appearance of the sun above a small cloud. Its skin glows and dries, and becomes hot to the touch.

When it is soaked in rain, it takes on its Rainy Form. It has a dark gray lower half resembling a storm cloud. The head turns blue and resembles a raindrop. Its body is soft and slippery and seeps with water when compressed.

When it is hit by hail, it takes on its Snowy Form. Its head turns purplish-blue. The rest of the body changes into the shape of a mint green, {{wp|cumulonimbus cloud}}. Its body becomes a smooth ice-like material, partially frozen measuring temperatures near {{tt|23 degrees Fahrenheit|−5 degrees Celsius}}.

===Form data===
Castform has four interchangeable forms, which it switches between based on the [[weather]] in {{pkmn|battle}}s and {{pkmn|Contest}}s, due to its [[Ability]] {{a|Forecast}}. Each of its forms has a different [[type]] to match the weather. Castform was the first Pokémon to have interchangeable forms.

By default, Castform is in its Normal form and is {{type|Normal}}. It is always in this form outside of battles and contests. It begins battles in this form and reverts to this form if [[Recall|withdrawn]]. It has this form in any weather that does not trigger another form, or if the weather has its effects negated by an active Ability. In [[harsh sunlight]], Forecast changes Castform into its Sunny Form, which is {{type|Fire}}. In [[rain]], Forecast changes Castform into its Rainy Form, which is {{type|Water}}. In {{weather|hail}}, Forecast changes Castform into its Snowy Form, which is {{type|Ice}}.

In Generations {{gen|III}} and {{gen|IV}}, if Forecast is suppressed or replaced, Castform will remain in its current form (regardless of the weather). From [[Generation V]] onward, if Forecast is suppressed or replaced, Castform will revert to its Normal form (regardless of the weather).

Castform's {{m|Weather Ball}} will usually receive {{STAB}} in any of its forms, except in a sandstorm, under {{m|Shadow Sky}}, or if it loses {{a|Forecast}}.

Castform's forms cannot be viewed in the forms section of the {{game2|Diamond|Pearl|Platinum}} Pokédex, nor do they appear on the field in {{2v2|HeartGold|SoulSilver}}. All of Castform's forms will appear in the forms section of the HeartGold and SoulSilver Pokédex upon obtaining one, even if it never transformed.

Prior to [[Generation VIII]], unlike most Pokémon with [[form]] differences, Castform's alternate forms had no {{Shiny}} variations of their own, so only the Normal form of a Shiny Castform would look different. Its Shiny forms were first seen in {{g|HOME}}; they first became directly obtainable in {{g|Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl}} (though they were also released in {{g|GO}} starting March 24, 2021<ref>[https://pokemongolive.com/post/weather-week-2021/?hl=en Therian Forme Thundurus brings rain and wind to Weather Week!]</ref>).

==In the TCG==

==Other appearances==
{{missing image|section}}
Castform was featured as one of the Pokémon released from a Poké Ball in the demo of [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]] that appeared at {{wp|Jump Festa}}.

==Trivia==
* Castform is the lightest {{Type|Normal}} Pokémon.
* In [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time, Darkness, and Sky]], Castform has a body size of 4, despite it being a body size 1 in {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team}} and having the same in-game sprite in Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness. This is due to all 4 forms of Castform's sprites being loaded into the game's memory at once, meaning that it is the equivalent of 4 Pokémon with a body size of 1 each in terms of memory. <!-- This last sentence previously got removed as "baseless speculation." Proof can be found here: https://imgur.com/a/HisyLk8 -->
* Before [[Generation VII]], Castform's Normal form was classified by Pokédex color sorting as white.
* Castform is the only Normal-type Pokémon in the {{egg3|Amorphous}}.
* Sunny Form Castform is tied with {{form|Rotom|Heat}} {{p|Rotom}}, {{p|Litwick}}, and {{p|Scorbunny}} for the [[List of Pokémon by height|shortest]] {{type|Fire}} Pokémon.
** Snowy Form Castform is tied with Frost Rotom and {{p|Snom}} for the shortest {{type|Ice}} Pokémon.

===Origin===
{{Bulbanews|On the Origin of Species: Castform}}
Castform resembles a living {{wp|cloud}} and acts like weather in general, but it may also be based on a {{wp|weather balloon}}. It is similar in both concept and design to a ''{{wp|teru teru bōzu}}'', a Japanese charm doll used to wish for good weather. Its forms and their types may have originated from the English saying "rain, hail, or shine". Its shape of a large sphere with two smaller orbs resembles an H<sub>2</sub>O molecule, matching how it is said to be composed of molecules similar to water.

Conceptually, Castform may also draw inspiration from or be intended to contrast with the {{wp|weather rock}} concept. These are stones jokingly hung up as a low tech way to tell the weather. They are intended to parody the poor forecasting of more complicated modern instruments. Given Castform's artificial origins and design to predict weather, but failure to transform until after the weather is already present, it may be comparable to the opposite extreme of a weather rock.

The Sunny Form looks like the {{wp|Sun}} on a cloud, the Rainy Form resembles a droplet of rain on a dark cloud, and the Snowy Form looks like a gust of wind or an ice cream cone.

====Name origin====
Castform may be a combination of ''forecast'' (the prediction of weather) and ''transform'' or ''form'' (referring to its ability to change form depending on the weather).

Powalen may be a combination of ポワン ''powan'' (onomatopoeia of a sudden transformation, similar to "poof" in English) and 変わる ''kawaru'' (to change or transform).
