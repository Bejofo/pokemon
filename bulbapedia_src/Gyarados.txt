'''Gyarados''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ギャラドス''' ''Gyarados'') is a dual-type {{2t|Water|Flying}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Magikarp}} starting at [[level]] 20.

Gyarados can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Gyarados''' using the [[Gyaradosite]].

==Biology==
[[File:Gyarados Mouth Closed.png|thumb|left|250px|Gyarados with its mouth closed]]
Gyarados is a {{wp|fish|piscine}}, draconic {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a long serpentine body covered in slightly overlapping scales. It is mostly blue with a yellow underbelly, and it has a row of yellow spots down each side. Its mouth is very large and gaping, bearing four pointed teeth and yellow lips. It has one pair of {{wp|barbels (anatomy)|barbel}} and a small white fin on each side of its face. The barbels are white on a female and blue on a male. It has small, red eyes, a three-pointed, dark blue crest on its head, and four white, spiky {{wp|dorsal fin}}s. Gyarados's tail fin is similar in structure to the crest on its head, except with a thin, white fin spread between the points.

The process of Evolution causes a change in its brain structure that is believed to cause its violent nature. Gyarados's fangs can crush stones and its scales are harder than steel. Gyarados is feared for its fierce temper and wanton destructive tendencies since ancient times. In some regions, Gyarados is called the "deity of destruction" because of this. It appears in times of conflict and destroys the surrounding area. Its rampages have been known to last a month at a time. These rampages can occur even during a harsh storm. A Gyarados's rage won't stop completely until everything is destroyed. Some believed any human settlement is fated to be destroyed should a Gyarados appear. Gyarados lives in both {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Water's-edge Pokémon|fresh and salty waters}}. Both Gyarados and its Mega form have demonstrated in [[Pokémon Chronicles]] and ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' that it can leap huge distances both from the water<ref>''[[HS02|Cerulean Blues]]''</ref> and from the ground<ref>''[[XY133|Coming Apart at the Dreams!]]''</ref>, usually several times its own body length. However, Gyarados is rarely seen in the wild. The move {{m|Hyper Beam}} is often associated with Gyarados due to it being being powerful enough to instantly destroy everything it hits.

===Forms===
Gyarados can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Gyarados.

When it Mega Evolves, Gyarados becomes bulkier. The fins on its cheeks become longer and gain a yellow tint. Its crest is larger and black, and its barbels also gain considerable length. A large spike extends downward underneath its chin, and it now has a black underside with a red stripe around the edges. The yellow spots along its body are replaced by raised red scales, which propel Mega Gyarados through the water. Two large yellow fins with blue spines appear on its back. Most of the other fins along its back disappear, replaced by two rows of blue spikes. There are now four yellowish, spiky fins near its tail: two on its back and two on its underside.

Due the stress Mega Evolution puts on a Gyarados's body, it becomes even more ferocious and rough-tempered than before.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160406143554/http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/pokemon/mega_pokemon/#Gyarados | Mega Gyarados | Official Site | Pokémon X and Pokémon Y]</ref> All other brain functions cease when Mega Evolution occurs, except for the destructive drive to burn down anything into cinders. Despite its brain having a powerful destructive instinct, it will obey a {{pkmn|Trainer}} it truly trusts. Mega Gyarados can launch at Mach Speed by using its orifices to release water from both sides. With this speed, it has enough power to split large ships in two. Mega Gyarados is tied with {{p|Hoopa}} {{fd|Hoopa|Unbound}} as the [[List of Pokémon by height|tallest]] {{type|Dark}}.

==Game data==
In [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl Versions|Diamond and Pearl]], a [[Shiny Pokémon|red]] Gyarados is featured on the TV on a program called "Search for the Red Gyarados." It is this that inspires {{ga|Lucas}} or {{ga|Dawn}} and {{ga|Barry|their rival}} to go to [[Lake Verity]], to see if there is a rare Pokémon dwelling in it.

===NPC appearances===
* [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness|Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time, Darkness]] and [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky|Sky]]: A Gyarados appears in the [[Miracle Sea]]. He scares off the {{p|Phione}} in order to claim the Phione Dew, but is stopped by the player's team.
* [[PokéPark Wii: Pikachu's Adventure]]: Gyarados tries to take over the [[Beach Zone]] in {{p|Empoleon}}'s absence. {{p|Pikachu}} then has to beat Gyarados's Aqua Dash so Gyarados stops trying to take over.
* [[Pokémon: Magikarp Jump]]: The player's Magikarp may evolve into Gyarados as part of the "Adios, Gyarados!" and "Macho Karp" {{DL|Pokémon: Magikarp Jump|Random encounter events|random events}}. However, once it evolves into Gyarados, it is forced to retire.
* [[Pokkén Tournament]]: Gyarados has been shown in the background of the Magikarp Festival stage as an NPC background Pokémon.

==Trivia==
[[File:Gyarados Red Battle Chess.png|thumb|Gyarados in Pokémon Battle Chess]]
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Gyarados's name was "Skulkraken", a combination of ''skull'' and ''{{wp|kraken}}'' (a mythological sea monster).
* The radio drama ''[[The Birth of Mewtwo]]'' contains an audio footage of Gyarados's {{pkmn|discovery}} by a female researcher which ends disturbingly.
* Gyarados and {{p|Magikarp}} are the only {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that can be obtained without a [[trade]], [[transfer]], or {{pkmn2|event}} in every [[core series]] game.
* Gyarados, Magikarp, and {{p|Regigigas}} are the three Pokémon that can be encountered in the {{pkmn2|wild}} at the lowest and highest levels. In {{B2W2}}, Gyarados can be found at levels ranging from level 1 to 100 in the [[Nature Preserve]] by using a [[Super Rod]] in rippling water.
* In [[Generation II|Generations II]] and {{gen|IV}}, Gyarados is the first of only two [[Shiny Pokémon]] to be integrated into a game's plot (the second was {{mdc|Celebi|2}} in {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}} and {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky}}).
* Gyarados's {{Shiny}} form is the first Shiny Pokémon to appear in the [[Pokémon Adventures]] manga.
* Gyarados and its pre-evolved form's [[Egg Group]] combination ({{egg|Water 2}} and {{egg|Dragon}}) is unique.
** Gyarados is the only {{type|Flying}} Pokémon in the {{egg3|Water 2}}.
* Despite being part Flying-type, Gyarados couldn't learn any Flying-type moves naturally prior to [[Generation VII]].
* Gyarados is tied with {{p|Pelipper}} as the most common Pokémon found amongst [[Gym Leader]]s, being used by seven of them. Coincidentally, both are dual [[Water (type)|Water]]/[[Flying (type)|Flying]] type.
** Gyarados is also used by two [[Pokémon League]] members (counting [[Blue (game)|Blue]] and [[Lance]] only once each) and two [[villainous team]] leaders, making it the most common Pokémon among boss Trainers in the core series at eleven appearances.
* In many ways, Gyarados is the counterpart of {{p|Milotic}}. Both are the serpentine evolved forms of weak fish Pokémon, and both appear in times of conflict; Gyarados to destroy, Milotic to becalm. Both have base stat totals of 540, the only difference being the distribution of their {{stat|Attack}}, {{stat|Special Attack}} and {{stat|Special Defense}} stats.
** Gyarados is tied with {{p|Milotic}} for the greatest increase in base stat total after evolving, at 340 points.
* Mega Gyarados is tied with {{p|Hoopa}} {{form|Hoopa|Unbound}} for being the [[List of Pokémon by height|tallest]] {{type|Dark}} Pokémon.
* Gyarados appears in {{DL|Pokémon Battle Chess|Pokémon Battle Chess}}. It doesn't behave like any traditional piece in chess. It is only present after Magikarp is damaged.
* Gyarados has featured as multiple cultural references in the Pokémon franchise including {{wp|Koinobori}} in ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' and a 1997 May calendar insert, {{wp|Shachihoko}} on a Nagoya Castle pin, {{wp|Merlion}} from Pokémon Center Singapore, and most historically as the Dragon Gate myth discussed further below.

===Origin===
[[File:EP244 Unknown Pokémon.png|thumb|200px|The unnamed Pokémon resembling Mega Gyarados]]
Gyarados appears to be based on a {{wp|Chinese dragon}} and a {{wp|koinobori}}. Gyarados is heavily hinted to be based on the Chinese tale of a {{p|Magikarp|carp}} ascending into a dragon upon swimming up a river or waterfall and then {{m|Splash|leaping}} over the {{wp|Longmen (mythology)|Dragon Gate}}. This legend is an allegory for the drive needed to overcome obstacles, which can be tied to the fact it can take a lot of effort to evolve a Magikarp into Gyarados.

Gyarados may also reference myths about earthquakes that were popular in Japan until the late Edo period. While said phenomenon is currently associated with the giant catfish {{wp|Namazu}}, older explanations involved a giant underground dragon encircling the Japanese archipelago, or located under certain islands (such as the {{wp|Chikubu Island}} in the {{wp|Lake Biwa}}). Notably, the [[Lake of Rage]] appears to be the Pokémon world's counterpart of the Lake Biwa.

Gyarados also seems to be inspired by depictions of vicious {{wp|sea monster}}s — mainly sea dragons and {{wp|sea serpent}}s — found on medieval and Renaissance maritime navigation maps, such as the ''{{wp|Carta marina}}''. This is further hinted by one of Gyarados' English names during early localization ("Skulkraken")<!--It's spelled with a single L due to character limitation-->, which references a {{wp|kraken}}. Alternatively, Gyarados could also be inspired by the South African cryptid {{wp|Inkanyamba}}, a giant, winged eel that causes storms when angry.

Mega Gyarados appears to continue the theme of cartographic sea monsters, incorporating details of fish-like depictions of creatures such as the {{wp|Leviathan}} and the Serra. Furthermore, its design, specifically its large dorsal fins, strongly resembles that of the unnamed "legendary water Pokémon" seen in the ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' episode ''[[EP244|Enlighten Up!]]'', first aired on April 18, 2002, in which Misty recounts seeing an unknown water Pokémon. This creature may have inspired the design of Mega Gyarados when it was eventually created 10 years later.

[[File:Gyarados Capsule Monsters 1990 Sprite Sheet.png|thumb|200px|Gyarados' beta sprite]]
On December 2018, the beta sprite for Gyarados was showcased on a NHK Broadcast in Japan, where it had a worm-like body with a mouthful of sharp teeth and barbels on the top of its head.<ref>https://www.newsweek.com/pokemon-beta-designs-red-green-1265710</ref> 

====Name origin====
According to [[Ken Sugimori]], Gyarados's name has no specific origin and was chosen merely for its "force".<ref name=Nameorigin>[https://archive.ph/ueFjq Tweet by 杉森 建 (@SUPER_32X).] Posted on December 12, 2011. Archived from the original via Archive.today.</ref> However, it may be variously derived from 虐殺 ''gyakusatsu'' (slaughter), 逆境 ''gyakkyō'' (adversity), or 逆転 ''gyakuten'' (reversal, turnaround); 荒らす ''arasu'' (to devastate); and 脅す ''odosu'' (to threaten).
