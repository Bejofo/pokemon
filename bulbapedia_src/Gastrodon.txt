'''Gastrodon''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''トリトドン''' ''Tritodon'') is a dual-type {{2t|Water|Ground}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation IV]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s from {{p|Shellos}} starting at [[level]] 30.

Gastrodon has [[#Form data|two different forms]]: '''West Sea Gastrodon''', which is pink and brown in appearance, and '''East Sea Gastrodon''', which is blue and green. They are found on the respective sides of [[Sinnoh]]'s mountain range.<!-- Due to this, there is a myth that the Sinnoh region was once split in two.-->

==Biology==
Gastrodon is a {{wp|sea slug}}-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. Much like its pre-evolved form, it has a slug-like body with a round head and a {{wp|Mantle (mollusc)|mantle}} covering the top half of its body. It has six stubby legs and two black eyes with white pupils, with a mark imitating a third eye appearing on its forehead. A yellow stripe runs along the edge of its mantle, through its two lower eyes, and around the back of its head. Like {{p|Shellos}}, Gastrodon has two forms based on the sea it lives in.

In its West Sea form, it has a pair of large tentacles on its head that curve upward and a smaller, straighter pair on its neck. Its underside is pink, while its mantle is brown, with three pink spots on each side of its back. There are also two lumps on its back, resembling the {{wp|cerata}} on real-life sea slugs.

In its East Sea form, it retains the head tentacles it had as a Shellos, which are now fully green and angled slightly further upward. Its underside is turquoise, while its mantle is forest green with two turquoise spots on each side. It has a pair of yellow, fin-like cerata on its back and a wavy yellow line bordering its side and rear.

Gastrodon and its pre-Evolution Shellos are examples of {{wp|allopatric speciation}}, although the two forms can still breed with each other. It is also a relative of {{p|Shellder}} and {{p|Cloyster}}. When threatened, it oozes a purple liquid and flees. While not poisonous, the fluid is very bitter and sticky. Its mucus-coated body is soft and squishy yet surprisingly resilient, and it leaves behind a trail of sticky slime when moving on land. It also has strong regenerative capabilities that allow it to recover from injuries or dismemberment within a few hours. In ancient times, it had a shell on its back, which gradually became a thin yet hard vestigial plate.

Gastrodon lives in shallow tidal pools, beaches, and rocky shorelines. Its diet consists mainly of plankton, but it is occasionally known to move onto land to look for other foods, such as beach sand. When it finds prey, it melts it with mucus before eating them. While Gastrodon cannot stay out of water for too long due to its body being highly vulnerable to dehydration, it becomes more active during cloudy or rainy weather. It has been found on far-off mountains during times of constant rain. The two forms of Gastrodon are known to engage in heated conflict with one another. West Sea Gastrodon was much more numerous in the past than it is in the present. Conversely, East Sea Gastrodon's population has visibly increased in population as of late.

===Forms===
Gastrodon has two separate forms: West Sea Gastrodon and East Sea Gastrodon. The two forms are purely cosmetic, and do not affect base stats or level-up moves.

===Form data===
Gastrodon has two different forms: West Sea Gastrodon and East Sea Gastrodon. In most cases, where it is encountered in the {{pkmn2|wild}} determines its form. This is purely a cosmetic difference, and this Pokémon cannot change between forms.

West Sea Gastrodon is pink and brown in color, whereas East Sea Gastrodon is blue and green. There is also a slight difference in shape depending on the form.

In [[Sinnoh]] and [[Hisui]], West Sea Gastrodon is encountered west of [[Mount Coronet]], while East Sea Gastrodon is encountered east of Mount Coronet. In [[Paldea]], West Sea Gastrodon is encountered in [[Casseroya Lake]], while East Sea Gastrodon is encountered in [[North Province (Area One)]]; both forms can also be found in [[Tera Raid Battle]]s regardless of location. In other [[region]]s, only one form appears in the wild per game (with the other only obtainable via [[trade|trading]] or [[transfer]]): Gastrodon only appears in its West Sea form in [[Kalos]]'s [[Friend Safari]], and in [[Alola]] and [[Galar]], only East Sea Gastrodon appear in the wild.

==Trivia==
[[File:Spr b 4d 423b.png|thumb|Early back sprite of Gastrodon]]
* According to an interview in [[Nintendo Power]] with [[Game Freak]], Gastrodon and {{p|Shellos}} were [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire beta|originally]] intended for {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}}.<ref name=NintendoPower>[[Junichi Masuda]]: There's also a sea-slug Pokémon that we weren't able to put in {{2v2|Ruby|Sapphire}} that we were able to put in <nowiki>[</nowiki>{{game|Diamond and Pearl|s}}<nowiki>]</nowiki>... | "Pearls of Wisdom", ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' Issue 215, May 2007, p. 37 ([https://imgur.com/a/kkZqB Scan])</ref>
* Both Shellos and Gastrodon have [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl beta|early back sprites]] within the game data of {{game|Diamond and Pearl|s}}; however, there are no front sprites for these forms.
* In Diamond and Pearl, no in-game {{pkmn|Trainer}} uses East Sea Gastrodon in battle, even on the east side of [[Mount Coronet]].
* Prior to Generation VI, Gastrodon's shape was [[File:Body14.png|32px]].
* Gastrodon and its pre-Evolution were accidentally released in {{g|GO}} on April 29, 2019, but were removed shortly after. On May 17, 2019, they made their official debut along with various other Pokémon from Generation IV.
* Gastrodon was featured alongside several bovine Pokémon, namely {{p|Tauros}}, {{p|Miltank}}, and {{p|Bouffalant}}, in multiple [https://twitter.com/poke_times/status/1346984961790906368 promotional] [https://www.pokemoncenter-online.com/?p_cd=4521329325095 artworks] created to celebrate New Year's 2021, also known as the {{wp|Year of the Ox}}.
* The {{g|Scarlet and Violet}} Pokédex entries mentioning a decrease in West Sea Gastrodon and an increase in East Sea Gastrodon may be an inverse on the changes in the populations of real life sea slug species due to climate change — with species that better survive in warmer waters becoming more common.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20220814133258/https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-01-18/citizen-science-project-counting-sea-slugs-helps-map-climate/10719706 Citizen science project counting NSW sea slugs helps map effect of climate change on species (retrieved December 2nd, 2022)]</ref>

===Origin===
Gastrodon is based on a {{wp|sea slug}},<ref name=NintendoPower/> perhaps one of the order {{wp|Opisthobranchia}}. It may also be based on a {{wp|Anaspidea|sea hare}}, a type of sea slug that is also known to secrete purple fluid in self-defense. The tentacles on Gastrodon's head are shaped like cattle horns, which may be a {{wp|visual pun}} on 海牛 ''umiushi'', Japanese for sea slug, derived from 海 ''umi'' (sea) and 牛 ''ushi'' (cow; cattle). Gastrodon has appeared in two different artworks celebrating the 2021 Year of the Ox in the Chinese Zodiac, further supporting this connection.<ref>[https://twitter.com/poke_times/status/1346984961790906368 Year of the Ox artwork from official @poke_times Twitter account (January 7, 2021)]</ref><ref>[https://twitter.com/poke_times/status/1347468106629869568 Year of the Ox artwork from official @poke_times Twitter account (January 8, 2021)]</ref>

====Name origin====
Gastrodon may be a combination of ''{{wp|gastropoda|gastropod}}'' or ''{{wp|Gastropteron}}'' (genus of sea slug), and ''don'' (Spanish for ''lord'') or ''-don'' (common suffix in dinosaur names derived from the Ancient Greek word for tooth).

Tritodon may be a combination of ''{{wp|Tritoniidae}}'' (family of shell-less marine gastropod molluscs) or ''{{wp|Charonia|Triton snail}}'' (marine gastropod mollusk named after {{wp|Triton (mythology)|Triton}}, Greek god of the sea), and ''don'' (Spanish for lord) or ''-don'' (common suffix in dinosaur names derived from the Ancient Greek word for tooth). It may also be derived from ''torito'' (Spanish for little bull).
