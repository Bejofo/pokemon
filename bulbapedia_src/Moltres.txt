'''Moltres''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ファイヤー''' ''Fire'') is a dual-type {{2t|Fire|Flying}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation I]].

In [[Galar]], Moltres has a dual-type {{2t|Dark|Flying}} [[regional form]] that was introduced in [[The Crown Tundra]] expansion. Neither Kantonian Moltres nor Galarian Moltres are known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

Along with {{p|Articuno}} and {{p|Zapdos}}, it is one of the three [[legendary birds]] of [[Kanto]].

==Biology==
[[File:Moltres Feather.png|thumb|left|250px|A Moltres feather]]
Moltres is a large, {{wp|Aves|avian}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a light yellow plumage. It has a long, flowing head crest and a billowing tail, both made of reddish flames. Additionally, its wings are also shrouded in fiery plumage. It has a long, thin neck, a pointed, brown beak, and small, triangular eyes. Its thin, brown legs have anisodactyl feet, with three forward-facing digits and one facing backward. 

Moltres sheds embers with every flap of its wings, creating a brilliant flash of flames: This display is said to have inspired the legend of the phoenix in [[An Illustrated Book of POCKET MONSTERS]]. In ''[[The Power of One]]'', its fire is said to have combined with {{p|Articuno}}'s ice to create the ocean's cradle, and it has some connection to the weather of the [[Orange Islands]]. By dipping itself into the magma of an active volcano, this Pokémon can heal itself. {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Rare Pokémon|Rarely seen}}, It migrates from the south with the coming of spring, and is said to bring an early springtime to cold lands. There have been stories of Moltres using its wings to assist those lost in the mountains. As seen in [[Pokémon Horizons: The Series|''Pokémon Horizons'']], like other [[Legendary Pokémon]], Moltres can be found in the Pokémon paradise [[Laqua]]. Moltres loves [[Moltres Treat]]s made by [[Snacksworth]], who once encountered it in the past.

{{pkmn2|Shadow}} Moltres is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Shadow Fire}}. Also, in [[Generation II]], {{m|Sky Attack}} was its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via {{pkmn|breeding}}.

===Forms===
Moltres has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Galarian}} Moltres.
[[File:146Moltres-Galar 2.png|right|thumb|200px|Galarian Moltres's {{m|Fiery Wrath|aura}}]]

In [[Galar]], Moltres has a similar build, but a drastically different color scheme. Its body is primarily black with scarlet highlights and bright blue eyes. Its scarlet beak is hooked at the tip and leads to markings that run down its front and behind its head. Its feet are also scarlet with black talons. Its wings, crest, and tail are mostly black, with the crest having an extra curl at the front and the tail being split in two, and all three of these features exude a magenta, flame-like energy that earns it the name of its Kantonian counterpart. Its body apparently feels lukewarm to the touch.

The sinister energy that blazes from within its body is so oppressive that most Pokémon can't even approach it. {{rf|Galarian}} Moltres attacks by spreading its wings wide to unleash its energy in {{m|Fiery Wrath|a powerful aura}} that attacks the minds of its foes, inflicting deep fatigue as it burns away their energy from within. The aura has the power to consume the spirit of its victims, reducing them to burned-out shadows of themselves. As seen in ''[[HZ022|Charge! Galar Mine!]]'', the only way to overcome the effects of its aura is to have a strong spirit. It is said to have a haughty personality and a calm demeanor. It is constantly migrating around the world but can be found in the [[Crown Tundra]] once every few decades congregating with the other birds at the [[Dyna Tree Hill|Dyna Tree]] to eat its fruits.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/expansionpass/pokemon/galarian-moltres/ Galarian Moltres | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref>

Galarian Moltres is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Fiery Wrath}}. Additionally, in [[Generation IX]], Galarian Moltres is the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Berserk}} as an [[Ability]].

====Trophy information====
=====Melee=====
''As tradition has it, the onset of spring heralds the return of this legendary Pokémon from its southern home. Its bright orange color and fiery aspect lends to its overwhelming appearance. {{m|Sky Attack}}, the strongest of flying moves, is a perfect fit for this burning phenom, but it obviously also excels at powerful {{type|Fire}} moves.''

=====Brawl=====
''"A Flame Pokémon. It's one of the legendary bird Pokémon. When Moltres appears in a town, it is said that spring will come earlier there than in other towns. If Moltres is injured, it apparently returns to a volcano to heal its wings with magma. Moltres spreads its wide, flame-covered wings and attacks opponents with the exciting and highly damaging {{m|Sky Attack}}."''

'''NA''': ''This Fire/Flying-type Pokémon is one of three Legendary birds in the Kanto region. It will use Fly when called into a Smash Bros. battle, flapping its orange wings and sending fire out around it. Getting hit hurts and could launch you so far, you'd make Moltres jealous. That isn't a good thing...''

'''PAL''': ''Moltres is one of the three Legendary Bird Pokémon of the Kanto region, along with Articuno and Zapdos. When spreading its huge wings and taking flight, it can make the flames all over its body burn even brighter. If you get hit by those flames during its Fly attack, you might go flying even further than Moltres! ''

Moltres returns as a Pokémon summoned from the Poké Ball, retaining its behavior from past games. It also appears as a {{sbw|Spirits (characters)|Spirit}} alongside {{p|Articuno}} and {{p|Zapdos}}.

* In English, the {{pkmn|category}} "Flame Pokémon" is shared by {{p|Charmeleon}}, {{p|Charizard}}, {{p|Flareon}}, [[Kanto|Kantonian]] Moltres, and {{p|Infernape}}.
** In Japanese, {{p|Flareon}} has the category ほのおポケモン ''Honō Pokémon'' (Flame Pokémon), while the other four Pokémon share the category かえんポケモン ''Kaen Pokémon'' (Flame Pokémon).
* In Generations I, {{gen|III}}, and {{gen|VII}}, a Trainer at the [[Cinnabar Gym]] mentions that [[Blaine]] became a Fire-type [[Type expert|expert]] after seeing a Moltres.
* Moltres's English name was suggested by Bill Giese, who assisted in the naming of many [[Generation I]] Pokémon.<ref name=MonsterKids />
* Moltres is the only one of the three legendary birds whose in-game location differs between {{game|Red and Green|s}} and {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}}, being found in {{ka|Victory Road}} in the former and in [[Mt. Ember]] in the latter.
* Moltres and the other two legendary birds had Australian beetle species [[List of references to Pokémon in science|named after them]]: ''Binburrum articuno'', ''Binburrum zapdos'', and ''Binburrum moltres''. The three species were first described in 2020, and were collectively named after the legendary birds to reflect their rarity.<ref>[https://twitter.com/YHsiaoBeetle/status/1345310387059625985 Tweet by Yun Hsiao (@YHsiaoBeetle)], posted Jan 2, 2021</ref><ref>Hsiao, Y. & Pollock, D.

===Origin===
Moltres seems to be based on the legends of {{wp|Firebird#Folklore|firebird}}s such as the {{wp|Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix}}, the {{wp|Firebird (Slavic folklore)|Slavic firebird}}, or the {{wp|Bennu}}. It may also be based on the {{wp|Vermilion Bird}} of the {{wp|Four Symbols|Chinese Four Symbols}}, which represents the element of fire and the direction of south. In addition, it may be based on a {{wp|heron}} because of their similarities in body shape.

As suggested by the Pokédex entries, the three legendary birds appear to be embodiments of {{wp|seasons}}, Moltres represents {{wp|spring}}, while {{p|Articuno}} and {{p|Zapdos}} represent {{wp|winter}} and {{wp|summer}}, respectively. {{wp|Autumn}} is however unrepresented.

Galarian Moltres appears to resemble a {{wp|cormorant}}. Its ability to make opponents fatigued with its aura may allude to {{wp|Occupational burnout|burnout}}, a psychological condition of which one of the main symptoms is exhaustion. Its {{Shiny}} coloration is similar to Kantonian Moltres's regular coloration.

====Name origin====
Moltres is a combination of ''molten'' and ''tres'' (Spanish for three, indicating that it is the third in the trio of [[Kanto]] [[legendary birds]]).<ref name=MonsterKids>Dockery, Daniel (October 4, 2022). ''[[Monster Kids: How Pokémon Taught a Generation to Catch Them All]]''. Running Press. p. 33. ISBN 978-0762479504.</ref><ref>(2006). ''[[Pokémon Fan (US)|Pokémon Fan]]: 10th Anniversary News Booklet'', p. 9 ([https://archive.org/details/10-anni-book/ Archive])</ref> It may also derive from ''{{wp|Molting#Birds|molt}}''.

Fire is literally ''fire''.
