'''Braviary''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ウォーグル''' ''Warrgle'') is a dual-type {{2t|Normal|Flying}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation V]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Rufflet}} starting at [[level]] 54.

In [[Hisui]], Braviary has a dual-type {{2t|Psychic|Flying}} [[regional form]]. It evolves from Rufflet starting at level 54. All Rufflet in Hisui will evolve into this form regardless of their origin.

==Biology==
Braviary is a large, avian {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with dark red feathers on its back and dark blue feathers on its underside. Its tail feathers are red, turning to yellow, and then blue at the tips. Braviary's legs are long and thick with yellow feet that each have a digit facing backward, and three facing forward. Each digit is tipped by a short, thick, black claw.

Braviary has a long, thick beak with a blue {{wp|cere}}. On either side of the cere are Braviary's eyes, which are greyish-blue with small black pupils and white reflections. Sprouting from above the eyes is a crest of three long, white feathers. At the base of the feathers is a red, W-shaped design that is spread across all three feathers. On each side of Braviary's face, sprouting out from behind the feathers on its forehead, are an additional three white feathers pointing horizontally and downward. Behind the three feathers on its head is a large mane of white feathers, draping over its neck. Combined, these features resemble a {{wp|Native American}} {{wp|war bonnet}}.

Braviary is extremely aggressive, but for noble reasons. It is known for its bravery and pride, and will fight fiercely to help and protect its friends. Even if it is injured or has its life threatened, it will still fight. The more scars it has on its front, the more respect it gets from its peers. Scars on its back will bring it ridicule, however. It has earned the nickname "the hero of the skies" due to its extreme dedication for its friends. Aiding its valiance, Braviary is extremely strong, capable of lifting a car and flying with it. However, due to its hotheaded and belligerent nature, it was rejected from being the [[Flying Taxi]] carrier in [[Galar]] in favor of {{p|Corviknight}}. Braviary is usually seen as a motif for different emblems.

===Forms===
Braviary has an ancient [[regional form]] in Hisuian Braviary. In [[Hisui]], Braviary grow even larger and have been known to be relied on by the indigenous people of Hisui for personal transport aross the skies. Their legs and undersides feature dark grey plummage while white feathers extend across their back, wings, and tail. Braviary's tail feathers are now shaped like a jet. The crest of feathers above its beak and now red {{wp|cere}} has evolved into a formation that appears to be purple flames adorned with two light blue eye-like markings, altogether resembling aviator goggles. The mane of feathers behind this formation has grown more voluminous and fans upward.

Unlike their Unovan counterparts, Hisuian Braviary prefers to live alone instead of flocks. Hisuian Braviary travels to Hisui from the north during the winter season. When it hunts, it sends out bloodcurdling battle cries, which can be imbued with its psychic powers to generate shock waves. It uses these shock waves to stun prey living underwater in lakes, causing them to float to the surface, before it grabs them with its talons and rips them apart. Hisuian Braviary can use its psychic powers to heighten its sixth sense, as well as to enter a trance for a physical power boost.<ref>[https://legends.arceus.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon/braviary/ Hisuian Braviary | Pokémon Legends: Arceus Official Website]</ref>

A special Hisuian Braviary is worshiped in Hisui due to him being descended from one of the 10 ancient Pokémon who received a blessing from {{p|Arceus}}. In particular, he is one of the [[Ride Pokémon (Hisui)|Ride Pokémon]] who resides in [[Alabaster Icelands]], watched over by the [[warden]] [[Sabi]]. This special Hisuian Braviary is known to assist humans.

Hisuian Braviary is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Esper Wing}}.

===Evolution===
Braviary evolves from {{p|Rufflet}}.

In [[Hisui]], Braviary has a [[regional form]] that evolves from Rufflet.

==Trivia==
* Braviary represents {{wp|August}} in the [[Unova]] [[horoscope]].
* Braviary and {{p|Rufflet}} can be seen as counterparts to {{p|Mandibuzz}} and {{p|Vullaby}}. Braviary and Mandibuzz share a base stat total of 510, evolve from their pre-evolved forms starting at [[level]] 54, and are both part {{t|Flying}}. Braviary and Rufflet are exclusive to {{game|Black and White|s|White}}, {{B2W2|White 2}}, {{pkmn|Sun and Moon|Sun}}, {{pkmn|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|Ultra Sun}}, and {{pkmn|Sword and Shield|Sword}}, while Mandibuzz and Vullaby are exclusive to {{game|Black and White|s|Black}}, {{B2W2|Black 2}}, {{pkmn|Sun and Moon|Moon}}, {{pkmn|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|Ultra Moon}}, and {{pkmn|Sword and Shield|Shield}}. Whereas Braviary and Rufflet can only be male, Mandibuzz and Vullaby can only be female.
* Unovan Braviary and its pre-Evolution were designed by [[Takao Unno]].<ref name=ND205 />
* In [[Pokémon Legends: Arceus]]'s internal code, Hisuian Braviary's Hidden Ability is {{a|Defiant}} instead of {{a|Tinted Lens}}.
* Hisuian Braviary and Hisuian {{p|Growlithe}} were the first Hisuian forms to be officially revealed.

===Origin===
Because the setting of {{game|Black and White|s}}, [[Unova]], is based on the {{wp|New York metropolitan area}}, the game designers considered how they could incorporate this setting — and more broadly, of America — into their designs. Braviary is based on the {{wp|bald eagle}}, which is the national bird of the United States. Its color scheme of red, white and blue is inspired by the {{wp|flag of the United States}}. Additionally, its design is influenced by {{wp|Native Americans in the United States|Native American}} culture, which is reflected by its strong legs and the feathers on its head,<ref name=ND205>''Nintendo Dream'' Vol. 205, May 2011 ([http://web.archive.org/web/20110402003550/http://shellspider.blog101.fc2.com/blog-entry-562.html Shellspider's blog (Japanese)], [http://lavacutcontent.com/ken-sugimori-nintendo-dream-6/ Translation by Dr. Lava])</ref> the latter resembling {{wp|war bonnet}}s. War bonnets were traditionally only worn by men, which is presumably reflected in Braviary's 100% male gender ratio. Braviary's personality traits appear to be based on {{wp|Stereotypes of Americans|American stereotypes}}.

Hisuian Braviary appears to be based on the {{wp|Steller's sea eagle}}, with its size, plumage, and southward migratory route to {{wp|Hokkaido}} (the real-life basis for the Hisui region). Its {{t|Psychic}} type might allude to the fact that the Steller's sea eagle is considered a {{wp|kamuy}} (divine or spiritual being) by the {{wp|Ainu people}}, who call it ''Kapatcir-kamuy.'' It also has a rare dark {{wp|Polymorphism (biology)|morph}} that resembles Hisuian Braviary's {{Shiny}} variant. The purple flames on Hisuian Braviary's head may be inspired by {{wp|Eyespot (mimicry)|eyespots}} or a {{wp|third eye}}, which is said to give psychic powers.  

====Name origin====
Braviary may be a combination of ''brave'' or ''bravery'' and ''{{wp|aviary}}''. It may also involve ''[[Wiktionary:eyrie|eyrie]]''.

Warrgle may be a combination of ''{{wp|war}}'' or ''{{wp|warrior}}'' and ''eagle''. It may also involve ''warble'', a sound a bird makes.
