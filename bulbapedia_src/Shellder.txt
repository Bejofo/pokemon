'''Shellder''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''シェルダー''' ''Shellder'') is a {{type|Water}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s into {{p|Cloyster}} when exposed to a [[Water Stone]].

==Biology==
Shellder is a {{wp|bivalve}} {{wp|mollusk}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} encased within a spiky, blue-violet bivalve shell. It has two round white eyes with tiny black pupils. Its long, red tongue, usually hidden due to the darkness of Shellder’s body, extends from its often closed mouth. Shellder uses this tongue to burrow into the sand to sleep overnight and to lure and capture prey. If it were to close its shell, nothing could come to it; however, the tongue protrudes even when its shell is shut. Tugging on it will cause the shell to pop open. Its soft and tender body is well-protected by its extremely durable shell, which is purported to be harder than diamonds and has historically been used by people to make shields. It can make pearls from accumulated sand, though it discards them as they are typically in its way. 

Shellder has an unusually strong appetite for the tail of a {{p|Slowpoke}} and can develop a symbiotic relationship with the Dopey Pokémon. After attaching itself to the Slowpoke's tail, the two undergo a metamorphosis and evolve into {{p|Slowbro}} together. Alternatively, if it attaches to the head of a Slowpoke in possession of a [[King's Rock]], the two will instead evolve into {{p|Slowking}}. These relationships allow it to travel onto land and begin a new stage in its life cycle. In [[Galar]], Shellder attaches to the forearms and heads of {{rf|Galarian}} Slowpoke wearing [[Galarica Cuff]]s or [[Galarica Wreath]]s, causing the Evolution into Galarian Slowbro and Galarian Slowking, respectively. Shellder that are part of Slowbro change in shape further if it Mega Evolves.

Regardless of which form the two Pokémon evolve into, Shellder's shell changes to a light gray color with irregular darker spots. Its shape changes into a spiny, spiraled cone with several tiers, which is slightly rounded for Galarian Slowbro. Sharp teeth develop around the rim of the shell to anchor it securely to the evolved Slowpoke, and its eyes now peek out from the bottom rim of the shell. In its crown form, Shellder has a large horn on either side of its shell, which is purple for Galarian Slowking. It also gains a gem: a red one on the underside for Johtonian Slowking, and a green one between its eyes for the Galarian form. As part of Mega Slowbro, it becomes large enough to contain most of the Slowpoke's body, gaining two holes near the rim and an opening at the tip, through which protrude the Slowpoke's forelegs and tail respectively. 

While in its crown form, Shellder will periodically release its venom into Slowking's brain. This is actually beneficial to Slowking, as it causes the Regal Pokémon's intelligence to increase. Higher quantities of venom intensify this effect, and Shellder is easily provoked into releasing more whenever Slowking yawns. However, Shellder's poison makes Slowbro more sluggish as it continues to drain nutrients from its host's body. As seen in ''[[JN026|Slowking's Crowning!]]'' and ''[[JN097|An Evolution in Taste!]]'', the crown form of Shellder can take control of humans who wear it and speak through its host. The control of Shellder wears off the moment the crown is removed.

Despite its hard shell, clamping on to an opponent will reveal its vulnerable parts. Because of this, it will only clamp itself to a foe as a last resort. It swims around its {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|seafloor home}} by rapidly opening and closing its shell while facing backward. Despite its appearance, Shellder is surprisingly fast. Prehistoric Shellder were apparently preyed upon by {{p|Omastar}}, whose powerful bites were capable of breaking through its shell. Shellder and its evolved form, Cloyster, are related to {{p|Shellos}} and {{p|Gastrodon}}. {{p|Kingler}}, {{p|Rufflet}}, and {{p|Bruxish}} are modern predators of Shellder.

Prior to [[Generation III]], {{m|Clamp}} was its [[signature move]]. Prior to [[Generation V]], {{m|Icicle Spear}} was also its signature move, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via {{pkmn|breeding}}. Additionally, prior to Generation V, Shellder and its evolved form, Cloyster, were the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that could have {{a|Skill Link}} as an [[Ability]].

==Trivia==
[[File:Slowking evolution anime.png|thumb|Shellder and Slowpoke evolving into Slowking in ''[[EP260|A Crowning Achievement]]'']]
* In ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'', Shellder is required to [[Evolution|evolve]] {{p|Slowpoke}} into {{p|Slowbro}} or {{p|Slowking}}. Shellder clamps onto a Slowpoke's tail to evolve into Slowbro, or onto its head while wearing the [[King's Rock]] to evolve into a Slowking. Even though Shellder changes form drastically when it bonds with Slowpoke to evolve (see above), it is not considered an Evolution in and of itself.
** Despite this requirement for Slowpoke to evolve, no game has ever reflected this beyond Slowpoke's [[Pokédex entry|Pokédex entries]]. Slowpoke instead evolves into Slowbro at [[level]] 37, and into Slowking while [[trade]]d with a King's Rock, and does not require the presence of Shellder, as opposed to {{p|Mantyke}} evolving with {{p|Remoraid}} in the [[party]].
** Shellder is said to produce poison and inject it into its host Slowbro or Slowking, but is not actually capable of learning any {{type|Poison}} moves as of [[Generation VIII]].
** In ''[[EP066|The Evolution Solution]]'', it is revealed that Shellder is still capable of speech as the shell of a Slowbro.
* Shellder were revealed to be capable of floating through the air in {{g|Snap}}, a trait that has been seen in no other media.
* Shellder and {{p|Cloyster}} share their {{pkmn|category}} name with {{p|Clamperl}}. They are all known as the Bivalve Pokémon.
* Shellder can be seen as a counterpart to {{p|Staryu}}. Both are Water-types in the {{OBP|Water 3|Egg Group}} [[Egg Group]], both evolve with a [[Water Stone]], and both gain a second type upon Evolution. Cloyster is seen as a slow defensive Pokémon, while Starmie is seen as a fast attacking Pokémon; and Shellder is exclusive to {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s|FireRed}} and {{pkmn|X and Y|Y}}, while Staryu is exclusive to LeafGreen and X.

===Origin===
Shellder appears to be based on a {{wp|clam}}, with its tongue representing a clam's "foot". Its ability to move by flapping its shell may have been inspired by {{wp|scallop}}s. Scallops are also related to the thorny oysters that resemble its evolved form. The fact that it latches onto {{p|Slowpoke}} and produces a beneficial toxin may be inspired by {{wp|leech}}es.

====Name origin====
Shellder may be derived from ''shell'' and possibly ''shelter''.
