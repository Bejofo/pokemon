'''Zoroark''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ゾロアーク''' ''Zoroark'') is a {{type|Dark}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation V]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Zorua}} starting at [[level]] 30.

In [[Hisui]], Zoroark has a dual-type {{2t|Normal|Ghost}} [[regional form]]. It evolves from Hisuian Zorua starting at level 30.

Both it and Zorua were the first [[Generation V]] Pokémon to be revealed to the public on February 10, 2010. Zoroark initially debuted as a silhouette before being revealed in full.<br>The Hisuian forms of it and Zorua were revealed in a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEb9gbJUUeA teaser video] on October 21, 2021.

==Biology==
Zoroark is a bipedal, slate gray, fox-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with crimson and black accents. It has a pointed snout and ears with red insides. It also has some red that rims its eyes and mouth. Zoroark has a large, red, voluminous mane with black tips, tied into a ponytail, as a teal bangle down its length separates a mass of the mane from the lower portion. It has a black ruff on its upper body, pointed at the shoulders from which its arms extend. Its upper arms are thin, whereas its lower arms, while still slim, are bulkier. The arms have spiky extensions of fur at the elbows, and it has red claws on its hands and feet. Zoroark's eyes are red-rimmed with light blue irises.

Zoroark can create illusions that are indistinguishable from reality, deluding many people simultaneously. It can even create illusory landscapes in the forests where it dwells, to hide its territory and protect its den. However, Zoroark is incapable of physically changing itself into another form; it is merely capable of casting illusions. When a Zoroark takes the form of a human, it is capable of human speech. It can make convincing illusions of attacks, and these illusions are extremely realistic, enough to fool even cameras and make one believe they're being physically affected, though the illusion does not have any direct physical effect. Lonely {{pkmn|Trainer}}s tend to use Zoroark to create illusions in order to ease their own burden of solitude. There are stories of Zoroark punishing people who tried to capture it with illusions.

Zoroark lives in groups, where unity is strong. It is extremely protective of those it cares about and will go to any lengths to keep them safe, including risking its own life, and it can hold grudges against those who harm its loved ones. Zoroark will hide its Zorua young in its mane to protect them and carry them around.

Prior to [[Generation VII]], Zoroark and its pre-evolved form, {{p|Zorua}}, were the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Night Daze}}. Additionally, Zoroark, its pre-evolved form, Zorua, and their [[regional form]]s, are the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Illusion}} as an [[Ability]].

===Forms===
Zoroark has a {{rf|Hisuian}} [[regional form]]: Hisuian Zoroark.

In the [[Hisui]] [[region]], Zoroark takes on a drastic ghostly appearance due to dying from the harsh conditions and being reborn through spite. Its main body color is now disheveled with light gray with red and white accents. Hisuian Zoroark's head and face are similar to its Unova counterpart but colored gray. It has gray ears with black insides and two white markings on both sides of the face. The ears also have light red split parts. The long mane has changed into a longer mane that is colored white with the ends of each tips being colored light and dark red, while covering the right side of Zoroark's face. The arms and legs have several red spots and light red fur that dangles around. The claws and toes of Zoroark are colored black. The eyes are now red with yellow sclera.

As a result of its appearance, Hisuian Zoroark was said to resemble an embodiment of death. The illusions channeled through Hisuian Zoroark's long withering fur are full of spite. Uniquely, this spiteful illusion can cause physical harm to its opponent on both the inside and outside. This power comes from the hatred it has for every living thing in the world. Hisuian Zoroark's illusion malice is powerful enough to drive anyone who sees it to insanity due to their terror. Hisuian Zoroark recklessly attacks its foes or nemeses, to the point its own bitter energy can cause physical harm onto itself. Despite its extremely hostile and aggressive nature, Hisuian Zoroark can be compassionate to those it cares about, such as Hisuian Zorua, and it will become an invaluable ally once someone earns its trust.<ref>[https://legends.arceus.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon/zoroark/ Hisuian Zoroark | Pokémon Legends: Arceus Official Website]</ref> Hisuian Zoroark prefers to reside in the cold areas where it lingers onto. Like its Unova counterpart, Hisuian Zoroark can make its illusion of humans talking, to the point of easily fooling anyone in order to get food.

Hisuian Zoroark and Zorua are the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Bitter Malice}}.

===Evolution===
Zoroark evolves from {{p|Zorua}}.

==In animation==
===Main series===
[[File:Raifort Zoroark.png|thumb|250px|Zoroark in {{aniseries|HZ}}]]
====Major appearances====
=====[[Zoroark (M13)]]=====
Zoroark debuted in ''[[M13|Zoroark: Master of Illusions]]''. She was threatened by [[Grings Kodai]] into attacking [[Crown City]], under the guises of {{OBP|Legendary beasts|M13|Suicune, Entei, and Raikou}}, in exchange for {{OBP|Zorua|M13}}'s safety. However, until later on in the film, she was unaware of the fact that Zorua had managed to escape.

=====[[Gladion's Zoroark]]=====
A Zoroark appeared in a flashback in ''[[SM116|The Secret Princess!]]'', under the ownership of [[Mohn]]. At some point after the disappearance of its {{pkmn|Trainer}}, Zoroark ran away and disappeared. It physically debuted in ''[[SM127|Chasing Memories, Creating Dreams!]]'', where it encountered {{an|Gladion}} and joined his [[party|team]] on his quest to find Mohn.

=====Other=====
Zoroark made its animated series debut in ''[[BW127|The Island of Illusions!]]''. It inhabited [[Grand Spectrala Islet]] and used its {{a|Illusion}} [[Ability]] to create [[giant Pokémon]] in order to protect the other Pokémon on the island from {{pkmn|hunter}}s, as well as running an abandoned [[Pokémon Center]] to take care of wild Pokémon. Decades earlier, it was a Zorua that a [[Nurse Joy]] once cared for, later evolving once Nurse Joy left the island.

A Zoroark appeared in ''[[HZ057|The Terapagos I Don't Know]]'', under the ownership of [[Raifort]]. Throughout the episode, it disguised itself as other {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} just for fun.

==Other appearances==
[[File:Zoroark SSB4.png|thumb|240px|Zoroark in Super Smash Bros. for 3DS.]]
===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U]]===
Zoroark appears as a {{i|Poké Ball}} summon. In the 3DS version of the game, it is unlocked after clearing 10-Man Smash. Upon release, it uses {{m|Fury Swipes}} to send fighters into the air, slash them repeatedly, and smash them back down. This move is very similar to {{p|Greninja}}'s [[Final Smash]].

[[File:Zoroark 3DS trophy SSB4.png|thumb|left|150px|Zoroark trophy in Super Smash Bros. for 3DS]]
Zoroark also appears as a trophy in both versions of the game.

====Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''This Dark-type Pokémon will protect its home and anyone it cherishes by creating illusions to fluster opponents. When it uses Fury Swipes, it will vanish from view and then suddenly appear next to its targets, launching them upward. It will then finish them off by sending them crashing back down. ''

'''PAL''': ''This Dark-type Pokémon is a powerful illusionist, and uses its power to confuse any that would threaten its home and loved ones. When it uses its Fury Swipes attack, it vanishes, then reappears next to an opponent and sends them flying into the air. It then slashes at them furiously before slamming them into the ground.''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Zoroark appears again as a Poké Ball summon retaining its behavior from the previous game. It also appears as a {{sbw|Spirits (characters)|Spirit}}.

* {{p|Zorua}}, Zoroark, and their Hisuian forms were designed by [[Atsuko Nishida]].<ref>[https://funs-project.com/poplab/007/index_2.html Fun's Project interview with Atsuko Nishida]</ref><ref>[https://www.instagram.com/p/CZR0ngKvAfy/ Instagram post by Atsuko Nishida]</ref>
* No other Pokémon has the same [[type]] [[List of Pokémon with unique type combinations|combination]] as Hisuian Zoroark and its pre-Evolution.
** Incidentally, they are the only Pokémon possessing the ''only possible'' type combination to be immune to both of their types, as the Normal and Ghost types are the only types immune to each other.
** Hisuian Zorua and Zoroark are the only Pokémon for whom one of each of their types cancels out a weakness of the other type: Ghost's immunity to Fighting cancels out Normal's weakness to Fighting, and Normal's immunity to Ghost cancels out Ghost's weakness to Ghost.
* Zoroark was first revealed by [[Junichi Masuda]] as a silhouette in the February 7, 2010 edition of [[Pokémon Sunday]]. Its full image was later revealed in the March 2010 issue of [[CoroCoro]], alongside its pre-evolved form {{p|Zorua}}.
* Due to its debut before [[Generation V]] in ''[[M13|Zoroark: Master of Illusions]]'', it can be seen as a parallel to {{p|Lucario}}, which debuted in ''[[M08|Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]]'', prior to the release of [[Generation IV]]. Unlike Lucario, however, Zoroark was revealed at the same time as its pre-evolved form.
** They both share the same names in Japanese and English versions of the game, have the same [[List of Pokémon by gender ratio|Gender ratio]], are in the {{egg3|Field}} and need [[:Category:Pokémon in the Medium Slow experience group|1,059,860 Exp.]] to reach level 100.
* Though evolving from Zorua at level 30, pre-release information from CoroCoro suggested it would evolve from Zorua by a method different from known [[methods of Evolution]]. What this method might have been if it was true is unknown.
* Zoroark and its pre-Evolution Zorua are the only non-Mythical Pokémon to have been [[event]]-exclusive for a time, prior to the release of {{B2W2}}.
* Zoroark appears in {{DL|Pokémon Battle Chess|Pokémon Battle Chess BW Version}}. Along with {{p|Emboar}}, Zoroark doesn't behave similarly to any traditional piece in chess.
* Prior to Version 1.2.0 of {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, Hisuian Zoroark's base stats were the same as Unovan Zoroark's. This change was undone when Hisuian Zoroark became available in those games. Similar occurrences happened to Hisuian {{p|Zorua}} and {{p|Kleavor}}.
** Furthermore, prior to the Version 2.0.1 update, Unovan Zoroark was unable to learn {{m|Encore}} via [[TM]], while its pre-Evolution could.

===Origin===
Zoroark is based on a {{wp|fox}}<ref>[https://funs-project.com/poplab/007/index_2.html Fun's Project interview with Atsuko Nishida]</ref>, possibly on the ''{{wp|kitsune}}'' of Japanese folklore, a shape-shifting mythical {{wp|fox}} that would trick unsuspecting travelers for fun. Its facial markings may draw from ''{{wp|Kabuki}}'' and ''{{wp|Noh}}'' theater makeup. It also resembles a {{wp|werewolf}}, due to the fact that it is an anthropomorphic {{wp|Canidae|canid}} with a propensity for shape-shifting. According to [[Ken Sugimori]], Zoroark's large mane being tied into a ponytail is supposed to be a stand-in for its lack of a tail.<ref>''Nintendo Dream'' Vol. 201, January 2011 ([http://lavacutcontent.com/ken-sugimori-nintendo-dream-3/ Translation by Dr. Lava])</ref>

Hisuian Zoroark may draw inspiration from a {{wp|revenant}} or a {{wp|vengeful ghost}}, notably an ''{{wp|onryō}}'', typically depicted with disheveled hair, wearing bright white garments, and having blood or wounds on them. It may also be inspired by Cironnup [[wp:Kamuy|Kamuy]], the [[wp:Ainu_people|Ainu]] deity of foxes, with ''Cironnup'' roughly translating to "those whom we kill many". Its coloration may be based on kitsune masks. The red portions on its arms and legs resemble frostbite sores. 

====Name origin====
Zoroark may be a combination of ''zorro'' (Spanish for ''fox'') and ''dark'', 悪 ''aku'' (evil), or ''arch-'' (prefix for "top" or "chief").
