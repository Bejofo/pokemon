'''Chespin''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ハリマロン''' ''Harimaron'') is a {{type|Grass}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation VI]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Quilladin}} starting at [[level]] 16, which evolves into {{p|Chesnaught}} starting at level 36.

Along with {{p|Fennekin}} and {{p|Froakie}}, Chespin is one of the three [[Kalos first partner Pokémon|first partner Pokémon of Kalos]] available at the beginning of [[Pokémon X and Y]].

Along with Fennekin, Froakie, {{p|Xerneas}}, and {{p|Yveltal}}, it was the first [[Generation VI]] Pokémon to be revealed to the public on January 8, 2013, as part of the {{DL|Nintendo Direct|Pokémon Direct}} broadcast.

==Biology==
[[File:Chespin Tumblr concept art.png|thumb|left|250px|Chespin's unique morphology, including its defensive quills and distinctive shell hole on the back of its head]]
Chespin is a bipedal, mammalian {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. It is primarily light brown with darker arms and three triangular markings around its face. It has oval, brown eyes; a triangular, red nose; and rodent-like incisors. Its arms have three fingers, while its feet have two long claws. Covering its back is a tough, green shell, which extends from its head to halfway down its tail. The tip of its tapered tail is orange. There is a small, off-center hole in the shell on the back of Chespin's head and, around the face, the shell has four leaf-like spikes. On the back of its head is another spike split into three parts.

Chespin's shell can protect it from powerful attacks. The quills on its head are usually soft but can be stiffened for attacking as well. Despite having a curious nature that tends to get it in trouble, Chespin keeps an optimistic outlook and does not worry about small details.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160224014849/http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/pokemon/starters/ Pokémon X and Y site | Starters (Archived)]</ref> By consuming tons of [[Berry|berries]], the bark shell that covers Chespin’s head and body will grow sturdier. It has been recently seen living in the [[Terarium]] of [[Blueberry Academy]].

Prior to [[Generation VII]], Chespin and its evolved forms were the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that could have {{a|Bulletproof}} as an [[Ability]].

* Chespin is the only {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} who has a base stat total of 313.
** Prior to [[Generation VII]], {{p|Woobat}} also had a base stat total of 313.

===Origin===
<!--Please do not add Porcupine as an alternative origin. The source states that it is based off a hedgehog-->
Chespin is based on a {{wp|hedgehog}}<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141031155604/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/55933/features/interview-game-freak-on-the-origins-of-pokmon-x-y/ Official Nintendo Magazine - Interview: Game Freak on the origins of Pokémon X & Y] (archive)</ref> and also appears to have been based on a {{wp|chestnut}} {{wp|shoot}} or {{wp|bur}}.

The brown spot found on the back of Chespin's head may be a subtle reference to {{wp|Bend-Or spots}}, most commonly found on a {{wp|chestnut horse}}. Bend-Or spots occur in breeds with chestnut coloration, and most chestnuts seem to have at least one.

====Name origin====
Chespin may be a combination of ''{{wp|chestnut}}'', ''{{wp|urchin}}'' (an old term for hedgehog), ''pin'', ''{{wp|Castanopsis|chinkapin}}'' (name of some species of chestnuts), and ''spina'' (Latin for thorn).

Harimaron may be a combination of 蝟 ''harinezumi'' (hedgehog), 針 ''hari'' (needle), and ''marron'' (French for chestnut).
