'''Raticate''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ラッタ''' ''Ratta'') is a {{type|Normal}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Rattata}} starting at [[level]] 20.

In [[Alola]], Raticate has a dual-type {{2t|Dark|Normal}} [[regional form]]. It evolves from {{rf|Alolan}} Rattata when [[level]]ed up at [[Time-based Evolution|night]] starting at level 20.

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for these details.)

==Biology==
Raticate is a large, {{wp|rodent}}-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. Although it is often depicted on its hind legs, it is a quadruped. It is primarily tawny-colored with a cream underside. It has narrow black eyes, ears with ragged edges and dark insides, and large incisors that grow constantly. There are three whiskers on each side of its face, which it uses to maintain balance. It has short arms with three-fingered hands and webbed feet with three toes. The webbing on its feet allows it to swim. Its tail is long and scaly. Females will have shorter whiskers.

If attacked, Raticate stands up on its hind legs, bares its fangs and shrieks in an intimidating manner at its enemy. It is willing to take on larger foes if provoked enough. Its teeth are strong enough to gnaw through steel and their constant growth means it often needs to gnaw on something, like rocks and logs. It may even chew on the walls of houses, and is capable of chewing through cinderblocks and toppling concrete buildings. As shown in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Raticate is known to sleep with a log in its teeth, gnawing at it in the process.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref> This Pokémon typically lives in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|plains and savannas}}.

Prior to [[Generation IV]], Raticate and its pre-evolved form, {{p|Rattata}}, were the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the moves {{m|Hyper Fang}} and {{m|Super Fang}}.

===Forms===
Raticate has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Alolan}} Raticate.

In [[Alola]], Raticate has become heavier and darker due to its urban environment and higher calorie diet.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170227055454/http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/alolan-raticate/ Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Alolan Raticate]</ref> Its fur is mostly black with a brown, leaf-shaped patch on its belly and brown inside its ears. Its hands, feet, cheeks, and tail are a whitish-cream color, and its hands are much smaller. It has large, puffy cheeks with four whiskers under its chin and two sprouting sideways from the top of each cheek. Its large incisors are still visible, but its eyes are now red.

This variant uses its nest as a food stockpile, and generally prefers to have the Alolan {{p|Rattata}} it commands to go out and forage for food while it remains in its nest and eats. It is selective in what it eats, however, only eating fresh, high-quality foods, such as fruits. Rumor has it that a certain high-class restaurant even exploits this selectivity, bringing Raticate along to buy ingredients and letting it taste test new dishes. Each Alolan Raticate has its own territory, and disputes over food and feeding grounds happen frequently. Alolan Raticate and Rattata are not native to Alola, having been brought to the region via cargo ships. Their populations grew drastically until {{p|Yungoos}} and {{p|Gumshoos}} were imported as a control measure.

A special Alolan Raticate in [[Alola]] acts as the [[Totem Pokémon]] for [[Ilima]]'s {{DL|Island challenge|trial}} in [[Verdant Cavern]]. This Raticate possesses [[Z-Power]], an energy that originates from [[Ultra Wormhole]]s and takes the form of a golden, flaring aura. The reward for defeating Totem Raticate and completing the trial is a [[Normalium Z]] (in {{aniseries|SM}}, it is a [[Darkinium Z]] instead).

===Evolution===
Raticate evolves from {{p|Rattata}}.

{{rf|Alolan}} Raticate evolves from Alolan Rattata.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Raticate (TCG)}}

==In the TFG==
One Raticate figure has been released.
* {{TFG|Groundbreakers}}: {{TFG ID|Groundbreakers|Raticate|27}}

==Trivia==
* Raticate's [[catch rate]] was 90 in [[Generation I]] and {{gen|II}}. This was changed to 127 in [[Generation III]].
* Raticate is the only Pokémon that shares its [[National Pokédex]] number with the level at which it evolves from its pre-evolved form, although this is likely a coincidence.
* Raticate and its pre-evolved form both share their {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Pikachu}}, {{p|Raichu}}, {{p|Sandshrew}}, {{p|Sandslash}}, {{p|Pawmi}}, and {{p|Pawmo}}. They are all known as the Mouse Pokémon, though {{p|Rattata}} and Raticate were originally called the Rat Pokémon prior to [[Generation III]].
* Of all the Totem Pokémon that can be battled in Alola, Totem Raticate is one of the only two Totem Pokémon that is battled in only one game out of the two versions — in this case, {{pkmn|Sun and Moon|Moon}} and {{pkmn|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|Ultra Moon}}. The other is Totem {{p|Gumshoos}}.
** During the cutscene before Totem Raticate's battle, it cries out {{p|Gumshoos}}'s [[cry]] instead of its own cry.
* Alolan Raticate and its pre-Evolution are the only regional forms that cannot be transferred out of {{g|HOME}} into any [[Generation VIII]] or {{gen|IX}} game.

===Design variations===
{{main|Pokémon controversies#Four-fingered hands|Pokémon controversies → Four-fingered hands}}

===Origin===
Raticate appears to be based on a {{wp|rat}}, as well as a semi-aquatic rodent such as a {{wp|muskrat}} or a {{wp|coypu}} due to its large size and webbed feet. Its scruffy ears are similar to a {{wp|guinea pig}}.

Alolan Raticate appears to be based on the {{wp|black rat}}, {{wp|brown rat}}, or {{wp|Polynesian rat}}, all of which are {{wp|invasive species}} in {{wp|Hawaii}}. Their attacks on sugar cane fields caused the locals to import the {{wp|small Indian mongoose}} into Hawaii as a form of pest control, explaining the relationship between {{p|Yungoos}}/{{p|Gumshoos}} and Rattata/Raticate. Its gluttonous behavior, ability to command groups of Rattata to steal, and hostile relationship with the detective-inspired Gumshoos are reminiscent of a stereotypical {{wp|crime boss}}. It has {{wp|cheek pouches}} similar to {{wp|chipmunks}} and {{wp|hamsters}}.

====Name origin====
Raticate may be a combination of ''{{wp|rat}}'' and ''eradicate'' (to destroy or exterminate) or ''masticate'' (to chew).

Ratta may be derived from ラット ''ratto'' (rat).
