'''Butterfree''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''バタフリー''' ''Butterfree'') is a dual-type {{2t|Bug|Flying}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Metapod}} starting at [[level]] 10. It is the final form of {{p|Caterpie}}.

Butterfree can [[Gigantamax]] into '''Gigantamax Butterfree''' if it has the {{DL|Gigantamax|Gigantamax Factor}}.

==Biology==
Butterfree is a {{wp|lepidoptera|lepidopteran}} {{wp|insect}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} which resembles a vaguely anthropomorphic {{wp|butterfly}} with a purple body. Unlike true insects, it only has two body segments and four light blue legs. The upper pair of its legs resembles small, three-fingered hands, while the lower pair resembles long, digit-less feet. Butterfree has two black antennae, a light blue snout with two fangs underneath, and large, red compound eyes. Its two pairs of wings are white with black {{wp|Insect wing#Venation|venation}}. Two oval scales on a female Butterfree's lower wings are black, but they are white on a male.

The wings of Butterfree are coated with poisonous scales that easily fall off continuously as it flies. If inhaled, it results in several status conditions. Using this powder, it will defend {{p|Caterpie}} from bird Pokémon. This powder also repels water, enabling it to fly and gather honey even in the rain. Butterfree can use its sensitive antenna to detect the odors of blooming flowers six miles (ten kilometers) from its nest in search of nectar, which it carries with the hairs of its legs. Sometimes, it has territorial disputes with {{p|Cutiefly}} over fields of flowers. It also consumes sap from trees pierced by {{p|Heracross}}, as seen in the ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' episode ''[[EP119|A Sappy Ending]]''. Butterfree is found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Forest Pokémon|temperate forests and jungles}}, but it is also observed in the episode ''[[EP021|Bye Bye Butterfree]]'' flying near the ocean as part of its migratory breeding pattern. As shown in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Butterfree is known to sleep while flapping its wings. It tends to accidentally scatter highly toxic dust while sleeping.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref>

===Forms===
Butterfree has a [[Gigantamax]] Form.

As Gigantamax Butterfree, its wings become shades of bright and dark green with a white pattern. A fur-like circle attaches to Gigantamax Butterfree's back at the base of the wings. Its antennae also become bright green and extend to the point where the tip bends, and three red clouds surround them. Its eyes glow bright red. Several green scales, created from crystallized Gigantamax energy, can be seen floating around Gigantamax Butterfree. These are its most effective weapons, capable of causing paralysis, poisoning, or sleep. Gigantamax Butterfree scatters these scales by the winds that it generates with each flap of its wings; these winds are powerful enough to lift a 10-ton truck.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon-galar-region/gigantamax-butterfree/ Gigantamax Butterfree | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref>

Gigantamax Butterfree is the only known Pokémon capable of using the [[G-Max Move]] {{m|G-Max Befuddle}}.

===Main series===
[[File:Butterfree anime.png|thumb|250px|Butterfree in {{aniseries|JN}}]]
[[File:Pink Butterfree M20.png|thumb|250px|Female pink Butterfree in ''[[M20|I Choose You!]]'']]
====Major appearances====
=====[[Ash's Butterfree]]=====
{{Ash}} had a Butterfree that he {{pkmn2|caught}} as a {{p|Caterpie}}, the first Pokémon he ever caught. He evolved from {{p|Metapod}} in ''[[EP004|Challenge of the Samurai]]''. Butterfree was also the first Pokémon that Ash [[released Pokémon|let go]], allowing him to mate with a [[pink Butterfree]] in ''[[EP021|Bye Bye Butterfree]]''. He later reunited with Ash in ''[[JN136|This Could be the Start of Something Big!]]''.

Butterfree also appeared in ''[[M20|I Choose You!]]'', which is set in a different continuity from {{aniseries|PTS}}. He evolved from Metapod during a {{pkmn|battle}} against a group of {{p|Primeape}}.

=====[[Pink Butterfree]]=====
In ''[[EP021|Bye Bye Butterfree]]'', Ash's Butterfree fell in love with a pink Butterfree and fought to save her from {{TRT}}. At the end of the episode, Ash released his Butterfree to mate with the pink Butterfree. The pink Butterfree reappeared in ''[[M20|I Choose You!]]'', which is set in a different continuity from {{aniseries|PTS}}.

=====[[Goh's Butterfree]]=====
In ''[[JN006|Working My Way Back to Mew!]]'', [[Goh]] caught a male Butterfree. He has since made further appearances in {{aniseries|JN}}.

=====Other=====
[[File:Orange Islands Butterfree.png|thumb|250px|An {{DL|List of alternately colored Pokémon in animation|Orange Islands Butterfree}} in {{aniseries|OS}}]]
Multiple {{pkmn2|wild}} Butterfree appeared in ''[[EP021|Bye Bye Butterfree]]'', all under the ownership of {{pkmn|Trainer}}s who released them so they could engage in a mating ceremony. Ash's Butterfree became one of these Butterfree.

In ''[[EP078|A Friend in Deed]]'', [[Ritchie]]'s Butterfree, [[nickname]]d Happy, was used to help Ritchie get out of Team Rocket's runaway truck safely. In ''[[EP079|Friend and Foe Alike]]'' and ''[[EP080|Friends to the End]]'', it was used during Ritchie's battles in the [[Indigo Plateau Conference]].

In ''[[EP083|Poké Ball Peril]]'', an {{DL|List of alternately colored Pokémon in animation|Orange Islands Butterfree|Orange Islands variant}} of Butterfree living on [[Valencia Island]] appeared. It had not eaten for days despite [[Professor Ivy]]'s effort to make different kinds of food for it. It took a liking to {{an|Brock}}'s food, however, and was one of the reasons he stayed behind. It reappeared in a flashback in ''[[EP115|A Tent Situation]]''.

==Trivia==
<!--DO NOT ADD TRIVIA ABOUT BUTTERFREE BEING RELATED TO VENONAT.-->
* Butterfree was the first Pokémon shown in {{aniseries|PTS}} with an alternate color, [[Pink Butterfree|pink]] in its case. This has only been seen in a single female, and unlike a {{Shiny}} Butterfree, which has green eyes and pink wings, limbs, and snout, this Butterfree only differed in its pink body and wings.
* Butterfree shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Beautifly}}. They are both known as the Butterfly Pokémon.
* Butterfree can be seen as a parallel to {{p|Beedrill}}. Both of their unevolved stages [[Evolution|evolve]] at level 7 and again at level 10. They both go through metamorphosis-like Evolution and have the same base stat total of 395. Also, while Beedrill is [[Version-exclusive Pokémon|exclusive]] to {{game|Black and White|s|Black}} and {{B2W2|Black 2}}, Butterfree is exclusive to White and White 2. Both also have an alternate form only available in-battle ([[Gigantamax]] Butterfree and [[Mega Evolution|Mega]] Beedrill, respectively).

===Origin===
Butterfree seems to be based on the {{wp|Aporia crataegi|black-veined white}} {{wp|butterfly}}.

Butterfree's parallels to {{p|Beedrill}} could possibly be a reference to the phrase "Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee", which was coined by American boxer {{wp|Muhammad Ali}}. This is further backed by the phrase being used in two episodes<ref>''[[AG061|Disaster of Disguise]]'' and [[BW106|Strong Strategy Steals the Show!]]</ref> of the English [[dub]] of the [[Pokémon animated series]] as "floating like a Butterfree and stinging like a Beedrill".

====Name origin====
Butterfree may be a combination of ''butterfly'' and ''free''. It may also involve パタパタ ''patapata'' (the sound of wings flapping) and 振る ''furu'' (to flap).
