'''Mr. Mime''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''バリヤード''' ''Barrierd'') is a dual-type {{2t|Psychic|Fairy}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]]. Prior to [[Generation VI]], it was a pure {{type|Psychic}} Pokémon.

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s from {{p|Mime Jr.}} when [[level]]ed up while knowing {{m|Mimic}}.

In [[Galar]], Mr. Mime has a dual-type {{2t|Ice|Psychic}} [[regional form]]. It evolves into {{p|Mr. Rime}} starting at level 42. All Mime Jr. in Galar evolve into this form regardless of their origin. Kantonian Mr. Mime is not known to evolve into any other Pokémon.

==Biology==
[[File:MrMimeSupremeVictors37.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Mr. Mime rock climbing]]
Mr. Mime is a bipedal, {{wp|humanoid}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. Blue growths resembling clown hair extend from the sides of its pale pink head, and there is a magenta circle on each cheek. Its jaw is curved inward, resembling the mouth of a wooden dummy. It has a round, white body with a magenta spot in the middle, light pink arms and legs that connect to its body via magenta spheres, and small white coverings over its knees. Its white hands resemble gloves with magenta pads on the tips of its white fingers and its dark blue feet curl upward at the tips.

From birth, this Pokémon is an excellent pantomime. As it matures, it gains the ability to solidify air molecules by vibrating its fingertips. This ability allows it to create invisible objects with its gestures. It punishes those who interrupt its act or are not impressed by slapping them. In the [[TCG]], Mr. Mime is [[Mr. Mime (Supreme Victors 37)|shown]] to be adept at rock climbing. Mr. Mime is usually very rare but can be found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Urban Pokémon|suburban areas}}. As mentioned in {{g|Sleep}}, it is hard to tell whether Mr. Mime is either sleeping or pretending to be asleep due to its masterful pantomime skills.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref>

In [[Generation II]], {{m|Substitute}} was its [[signature move]]. Prior to [[Generation VI]] and in [[Generation VIII]], Mr. Mime and its pre-evolved form, {{p|Mime Jr.}}, were the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that could have {{a|Filter}} as an [[Ability]].

===Forms===
Mr. Mime has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Galarian}} Mr. Mime.

{{rf|Galarian}} Mr. Mime are mostly blue and white. It also has blue growths resembling clown hair on its pale head; however, these also extend and cover its cheeks, creating a mutton chop style sideburn effect resembling earmuffs. It has wider-shaped eyes and a small blue triangle for a nose. It has a suit-like body comprising a white top, blue shoulder spheres, blue bottom trousers, and a diamond-shaped crystal that resembles a tie. It has mitten-like hands and feet that are more defined, resembling blue shoes with light blue soles, presumably made out of ice. 

Through its feet, it is able to control the temperature and create a floor of ice, which it can kick up to act as a barrier. It is widely known in the region for its talent in tap dancing (contrasting Kantonian Mr. Mime's talent in pantomiming) and is likely the result of {{p|Mr. Rime}}'s influence over {{p|Mime Jr.}} imitating their dance steps.

Galarian Mr. Mime and its evolved form, Mr. Rime, are the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Screen Cleaner}} as an [[Ability]].

===Evolution===
Mr. Mime evolves from {{p|Mime Jr.}}

{{rf|Galarian}} Mr. Mime evolves from Mime Jr. and evolves into {{p|Mr. Rime}}.

(For specifics on this Pokémon's Evolution in the games, refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]].)

===Specific appearances===
* {{g|Stadium 2}}: Mr. Mime stars in its own minigame called "Barrier Ball", where they use {{m|Barrier}} to bounce {{i|Poké Ball}}s into opposing players' goals while defending their own.
* [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness]], and [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky|Explorers of Sky]]: During the post-game, a few days after the graduation ceremony, Mr. Mime will appear in [[Treasure Town]], saying that a famous {{p|Scizor}} has been trapped in a dungeon called [[Blizzard Island]]. Afterwards, Mr. Mime will remain in Treasure Town. In Explorers of Sky, it also appears before the post-game as a regular visitor of [[Spinda's Cafe]].

=====Other=====

[[File:Mr. Mime Detective Pikachu.jpg|thumb|250px|Mr. Mime in {{DetPikMov}}]]
==={{DetPikMov}}===
A Mr. Mime appeared in {{DetPikMov}}, where it was encountered by {{OBP|Detective Pikachu|character}} and [[Tim Goodman]] at [[Ryme Wharf]] while they were searching for the source of the [[R]] substance. Having previously been interrogated by Tim's father [[Harry Goodman|Harry]] and Detective Pikachu before, it tried to mime an escape but was unsuccessful. Tim and Pikachu then tried interrogating it, but it taunted them and used {{m|Barrier}} to shield itself from any other questioning. This prompted Tim to try and "get inside its head", and he mimed opening the door to Mr. Mime's "room", pouring gasoline on it, and threatening it by miming a lit match. Mr. Mime relented and revealed that it had gotten the R from the "roundhouse", an illegal fight club owned by {{OBP|Sebastian|Detective Pikachu}}. In their excitement, Tim accidentally dropped the "match", much to Mr. Mime's horror.

==Trivia==
* Despite its English and French names containing a male-exclusive {{wp|honorific}}, Mr. Mime's [[gender ratio]] is evenly split between male and female.
** This discrepancy is probably due to the fact that Mr. Mime's Japanese name, Barrierd, does not reference gender. Also, Mr. Mime was introduced in [[Generation I]], before the gender mechanic was introduced.
** Based on this, translator [[Nob Ogasawara]] was wary about Mr. Mime's English name during localization: "If they make sequels and they give genders to Pokemon, we're going to be hooped."<ref>[https://lparchive.org/Pokemon-Blue/code.html Lets Break PKMN Blue Thread Bits - SomethingAwful Forums]</ref><ref>[https://twitter.com/DougDinsdale/status/1269697794765279233 Nob Ogasawara on Twitter]</ref>
* Mr. Mime is the only Pokémon to have its English name changed between generations. Prior to [[Generation III]], it was known as Mr.Mime, without the space.
* The Mr. Mime obtained through an in-game [[trade]] in {{game|Red and Blue|s}} was [[nickname]]d Marcel. This may have been a homage to {{wp|Marcel Marceau}}, a French mime artist. However, this was not kept in {{game|Yellow}} or {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}}; the same Mr. Mime is [[nickname]]d Miles in Yellow, and Mimien in FireRed and LeafGreen.
** This is referenced in [[Pokémon Sword and Shield]], where a boy in [[Wyndon]] says a nearby Galarian Mr. Mime is named Marcel.
* {{rf|Galarian}} Mr. Mime is:
** The only [[regional form]] with an exclusive evolved form that evolves from a Pokémon without a regional form of its own.
** The only Pokémon evolved by {{m|Mimic|knowing a certain move}} that can evolve further.
** The only Galarian form that can have the [[Origin mark|Hisuian origin mark]], due to Mime Jr. being able to have it.
* Galarian Mr. Mime shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Oricorio}}. They are both known as the Dancing Pokémon.
* Galarian Mr. Mime has the highest [[base stat total]] of any Pokémon that can evolve by leveling up.
* Mr. Mime and {{p|Lycanroc}} are the only two Pokémon known to have six possible {{Abilities}} between their forms, the most of any Pokémon.
* Mr. Mime is the only wild Pokémon in {{g|Legends: Arceus}} that can prevent players from battling it, as the barrier it sets up disrupts any Poké Balls that hit it.

===Design variations===
<!--This is notable, do not remove. -DETH-->
{{main|Pokémon controversies#Four-fingered hands|Pokémon controversies → Four-fingered hands}}
In all official artwork and in-game [[#Sprites|sprites]] prior to the release of {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}}, as well as in early appearances in the [[Pokémon Adventures]] manga, Mr. Mime only has four fingers. However, Mr. Mime has always been depicted with five fingers in {{aniseries|PTS}}, including the [[original series]], and from FireRed and LeafGreen onward, it is consistently depicted with five fingers across media.

===Origin===
Mr. Mime seems to be based on a {{wp|mime artist}}, specifically the {{wp|pantomime}} of pretending to be trapped in invisible boxes. Its brightly colored body is also reminiscent of a {{wp|clown}} and a {{wp|court jester}}. The blue growths on its head resemble a {{wp|cap and bells|fool's cap}}, and its curled feet resemble a jester's hook-toed shoes. Its curled feet are also reminiscent of modern depictions of {{wp|elves}}. Elves are often portrayed as fairy-like beings and in some cases the terms are used interchangeably; this may explain why Mr. Mime was changed to be part-{{t|Fairy}} with the type's introduction in [[Generation VI]]. Its jerky animations cause it to resemble a jointed {{wp|puppet}} or {{wp|doll}}. In Japanese folklore, inanimate objects that are possessed by spirits and come to life are known as ''{{wp|tsukumogami}}''.

Galarian Mr. Mime appears to be based on both {{wp|tap dance}}rs and {{wp|ice skating|ice skaters}}. The soles of its feet resemble {{wp|tap dance#Tap shoes|tap shoes}}, the blue spots on the sides of its head resemble {{wp|earmuffs}}, its fingers resemble {{wp|Glove#Mittens|mittens}}, and the ice on its chest resembles a {{wp|necktie}}. Its round body is also reminiscent of a {{wp|snowman}}.

====Name origin====
Mr. Mime is an abbreviation of ''Mister'' and ''{{wp|mime}}''.

Barrierd may be a combination of ''barrier'' (referring to the invisible walls it can create) and ''weird''.
