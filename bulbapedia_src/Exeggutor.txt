'''Exeggutor''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ナッシー''' ''Nassy'') is a dual-type {{2t|Grass|Psychic}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Exeggcute}} when exposed to a [[Leaf Stone]].

In [[Alola]], Exeggutor has a dual-type {{2t|Grass|Dragon}} [[regional form]]. It evolves from {{p|Exeggcute}} when exposed to a Leaf Stone. All Exeggcute in Alola evolve into this form regardless of their origin. These Exeggutor can also be found in [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]].

==Biology==
Exeggutor is a tall, bipedal {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that resembles a {{wp|coconut}} tree or {{wp|Arecaceae|palm}} tree. Its body and legs are light brown with thin black rings and its legs are thick with two-toed feet. There is a light yellow paw pad on each foot's underside. It has thin, green leaves sprouting from the top of its body. Exeggutor has three round, light yellow heads that resemble coconuts, each with different facial expressions.

Exeggutor's heads think independently and don't appear interested in one another, so it makes a lot of noise as each head speaks its mind. They still appear to get along, though, for they never squabble amongst themselves. If all the heads want to go in a different direction, its body is unable to move. They are able to communicate telepathically as well and sometimes use it to come to a joint decision. It uses psychic powers to fight, and since all three heads are capable its power is tripled. If one of these heads grows too large, it falls off and groups together with others to become an {{p|Exeggcute}}. In the {{aniseries|OS}} episode ''[[EP043|The March of the Exeggutor Squad]]'', Exeggutor also has been seen in groups of its own kind, meaning that it is not a solitary Pokémon. Exeggutor has been referred to as "The Walking Tropical Rainforest" or "The Walking Jungle". It can be sluggish during cloudy days due to the lack of sunlight. Being the result of an Evolution via [[Evolution stone]], Exeggutor is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Forest Pokémon|forests and jungles}}.

Exeggutor and its pre-evolved form, {{p|Exeggcute}}, are the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Barrage}}.

===Forms===
[[File:Exeggutor SM concept art.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Alolan Exeggutor, in comparison to its original counterpart, grows abundantly due to [[Alola]]'s sun]]
Exeggutor has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Alolan}} Exeggutor.

Due to the abundance of sunlight in the [[Alola]] [[region]], the Exeggutor that live there grow over five times taller than those in other regions. The region is considered to be the best environment for Alolan Exeggutor. Alolan Exeggutor's neck is thinner and much longer, causing it to more closely resemble a coconut tree or tropical palm tree than its Kantonian counterpart, which resembles the shorter desert palm. It has a long, tapering tail with two leaves and a fourth light green head on the tip.

This extra head can also act on its own and defend the rear.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20171012040631/http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/alolan-exeggutor/ Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Alolan Exeggutor,] archived October 12th, 2017</ref> The tail can use weak telepathy to scan the surrounding area. Its long neck can be used as a whip to attack enemies with its hard head. However, its neck can also be a weak point, as it will become dizzy swinging it around. Its increased height reduced its need for a psychic defense and has instead awakened its draconic powers, resulting in its psychic powers becoming weaker.

Ancient carvings and murals depict this Pokémon. Alolan Exeggutor is considered the pride of the Alola region by its natives. Alolans take pride in its appearance, claiming this is what Exeggutor ought to look like. Its extra height makes it the [[List of Pokémon by height|tallest]] and [[List of Pokémon by weight|heaviest]] {{type|Grass}}. Alolan Exeggutor can be found on [[Exeggutor Island]], a former trial site in Alola, which is not only shaped like an Exeggutor, but contains many wild Exeggutor, giving the island its name. They can also be found in the [[Coastal Biome]] of [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]], where Alola's island life is simulated.

In [[Generation VII]], {{m|Dragon Hammer}} was its signature move, but {{p|Tropius}} could still inherit it via {{pkmn|breeding}}.

In ''[[EP075|Round One - Begin!]]'', [[Mandi]]'s Exeggutor was the first Pokémon Ash faced in the [[Indigo Plateau Conference]].

* Alolan Exeggutor was the first [[Alolan form]] to be officially revealed.

===Design variations===
{{main|Variant Pokémon#Exeggcute and Exeggutor|Variant Pokémon → Exeggcute and Exeggutor}}
[[File:Exeggutor 5 heads.png|thumb|250px|Exeggutor with five heads in ''[[EP043|The March of the Exeggutor Squad]]'']]
The number of heads Exeggutor has used to vary in earlier media. Exeggutor is depicted with an extra head on its back in every [[core series]] game up until {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}}. In its [[Pokédex]] entry for {{game|Crystal}}, it is stated that "living in a good environment makes it grow lots of heads". In the early seasons of ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'', it was occasionally depicted with more than three heads, often distributed in a ring around its torso rather than just on the front. In ''[[EP043|The March of the Exeggutor Squad]]'', an Exeggutor's leaves are cut, revealing five heads. Additionally, official game art during this period also depicted Exeggutor with its heads distributed around its body, though not exceeding three heads. However, from FireRed and LeafGreen onwards, Exeggutor is consistently depicted with three heads on the front and none on the back across official media.

===Origin===
Exeggutor appears to be based on a {{wp|coconut}} tree or desert {{wp|Arecaceae|palm}} tree and possibly the Japanese monster {{wp|Jinmenju}}, a tree that grows human heads that are always smiling. It might also be inspired by a {{wp|yucca}} plant, with its bulky trunk and blade-like leaves. It may also draw inspiration from {{wp|Asura_(Buddhism)|Buddhist asuras}}, three-headed demigods whose faces are sometimes said to each express one of the emotions of joy, anger, and sorrow. This quality is also reflected in another Pokémon, [[Dodrio]]. Exeggutor's {{t|Psychic}} [[type]] may come from the idea of {{wp|telepathy}}.

{{rf|Alolan}} Exeggutor more closely resembles a coconut tree or tropical palm tree. Its {{t|Dragon}} type may be a reference to the ''{{wp|Dracaena (plant)|Dracaena}}'' genus of trees. It may also be a pun inspired by the {{wp|Coco (folklore)#Physical representations|Coca}}, a dragon whose name shares the same origins as the word ''coconut''. Its dramatically larger size may also reference {{wp|island gigantism}}.

====Name origin====
Exeggutor may be a combination of ''egg'' and ''executor''.

Nassy may be a combination of ココナッツ ''kokonattsu'' (coconuts) and 椰子 ''yashi'' (palm tree).
