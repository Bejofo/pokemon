'''Eevee''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''イーブイ''' ''Eievui'') is a {{type|Normal}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s into one of [[Eeveelution|eight different Pokémon]] through various methods.
* Since [[Generation I]]:
** Eevee evolves into {{p|Vaporeon}} when exposed to a [[Water Stone]].
** Eevee evolves into {{p|Jolteon}} when exposed to a [[Thunder Stone]].
** Eevee evolves into {{p|Flareon}} when exposed to a [[Fire Stone]].
* Since [[Generation II]]:
** Eevee evolves into {{p|Espeon}} when [[friendship Evolution|leveled up with high friendship]] during the [[Time-based Evolution|day]] or with a [[Sun Shard]] in the [[Player character|player's]] [[Bag]].
** Eevee evolves into {{p|Umbreon}} when leveled up with high friendship during the [[Time-based Evolution|night]] or with a [[Moon Shard]] in the player's Bag.
* Since [[Generation IV]]:
** Eevee evolves into {{p|Leafeon}} when leveled up near a [[Moss Rock]] or when exposed to a [[Leaf Stone]].
** Eevee evolves into {{p|Glaceon}} when leveled up near an [[Ice Rock]] or when exposed to an [[Ice Stone]].
* Since [[Generation VI]]:
** Eevee evolves into {{p|Sylveon}} when leveled up while knowing a {{type|Fairy}} [[move]] and having high friendship.
(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for these details.)

Additionally, Eevee has two [[#Form data|forms]]: the '''{{OBP|Partner Pokémon|Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|partner}} Eevee''' and '''Gigantamax Eevee'''. It can [[Gigantamax]] into Gigantamax Eevee if it has the {{DL|Gigantamax|Gigantamax Factor}}. The partner Eevee and Eevee with the Gigantamax Factor cannot evolve.

Eevee is the [[game mascot]] of and the [[List of the player's first Pokémon|player's first Pokémon]] in {{LGPE|Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee!}}. It also serves as the player's first Pokémon in {{g|XD: Gale of Darkness}} and {{g|Conquest}}. It also is the first Pokémon employee in {{g|Café Mix}}. In {{game|Yellow}}, [[Professor Oak]] had originally intended to give Eevee to the player as their first Pokémon, but it is taken by {{ga|Blue}} instead.

==Biology==
Eevee is a small, {{wp|mammal}}ian, quadrupedal {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with primarily brown fur. The tip of its bushy tail and its large furry collar are cream-colored. It has short, slender legs with three small toes and a pink paw pad on each foot. Eevee has brown eyes, long pointed ears with dark brown interiors, and a small black nose.

Eevee is rarely found in the wild and is mostly only found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Urban Pokémon|cities and towns}}. It is said to have an irregularly shaped genetic structure that is easily influenced by its environment. This allows it to adapt to a variety of habitats by [[Evolution|evolving]]. Eevee can potentially evolve into [[Eeveelution|eight different Evolutions]]. Eevee can also start to adopt the face of the Trainer that owns it. Eevee's genes are believed to have the key to solving the mysteries of Pokémon Evolution. As mentioned in {{g|Sleep}}, Eevee is believed to dream about which form it will evolve into.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref>

Eevee is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of using the [[Z-Move]] {{m|Extreme Evoboost}}.

===Forms===
Eevee has two forms: the {{OBP|Partner Pokémon|Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|partner}} Eevee and [[Gigantamax]] Eevee.

====Partner Eevee====
The partner Eevee has purple eyes and a lighter shade of fur. These design elements were likely taken from ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'', which implemented similar traits starting in {{aniseries|AG}}. The partner Eevee has higher base stats and access to [[move]]s that normal Eevee do not. The white tip on a [[Variant Pokémon#Eevee|female partner Eevee]]'s tail has larger, rounder scallops than other Eevee. Before {{g|Sword and Shield}}, this trait was unique and wasn't found on other female Eevee. Since Sword and Shield, however, the unique tail pattern is present on all female Eevee as a true [[List of Pokémon with gender differences|gender difference]]. As a result, {{g|GO}} was updated to apply this change to all female Eevee as well.

The partner Eevee is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of using the moves {{m|Bouncy Bubble}}, {{m|Buzzy Buzz}}, {{m|Sizzly Slide}}, {{m|Glitzy Glow}}, {{m|Baddy Bad}}, {{m|Sappy Seed}}, {{m|Freezy Frost}}, and {{m|Sparkly Swirl}}, as well as the partner power {{m|Veevee Volley}}.

====Gigantamax Eevee====
As [[Gigantamax]] Eevee, it has become larger and more fluffy. The fur collar becomes longer with several triangular furs pointing straight up. The right ear has three red clouds circling it. Due to the fur becoming fluffier and more luxurious, any enemies caught in it will become enamored and lose the will to fight. Eevee becomes even more playful and rambunctious after Gigantamaxing, desiring to play with its opponent and often unintentionally crushing them with its size.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon-galar-region/gigantamax-eevee/ Gigantamax Eevee | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref>

Gigantamax Eevee is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of using the [[G-Max Move]] {{m|G-Max Cuddle}}.

===Form data===
Eevee has two forms: the {{OBP|Partner Pokémon|Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|partner}} Eevee and [[Gigantamax]] Eevee. Only Gigantamax Eevee is recognized by an in-game [[Pokédex]] (in {{g|Sword and Shield}} and {{g|HOME}}). Partner Eevee has only been named in promotional materials.<ref>[https://pokemonletsgo.pokemon.com/en-us/story/ Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! | Experience the World of Pokémon]</ref>

====Partner Eevee====
The {{OBP|Partner Pokémon|Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|partner}} Eevee is the Pokémon the player starts with in {{LGPE|Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee!}}. [[Gender|Female]] partner Eevee also have a distinct pattern on their tail (although this was applied to all female Eevee in subsequent [[generation]]s); male Partner Eevee and standard Eevee of either gender have the same pattern. It has higher base stats than normal Eevee. Unlike other Eevee, the partner Eevee can learn the exclusive moves {{m|Bouncy Bubble}}, {{m|Buzzy Buzz}}, {{m|Sizzly Slide}}, {{m|Glitzy Glow}}, {{m|Baddy Bad}}, {{m|Sappy Seed}}, {{m|Freezy Frost}}, and {{m|Sparkly Swirl}}, as well as having access to the [[partner power]] {{m|Veevee Volley}}.

The partner Eevee is not differentiated from standard Eevee in {{LGPE}}'s Pokédex, and it cannot be transferred out of the games.

====Gigantamax====
Gigantamax Eevee can only be obtained through special methods, and the {{DL|Gigantamax|Gigantamax Factor}} cannot be [[Pokémon breeding|bred]].

}}

===Evolution data===
Eevee can evolve into eight different Pokémon (collectively called [[Eeveelution]]s).

Eevee can always evolve into {{p|Vaporeon}}, {{p|Jolteon}}, or {{p|Flareon}} when exposed to a [[Water Stone]], [[Thunder Stone]], or [[Fire Stone]], respectively.

Since [[Generation II]], Eevee can evolve into {{p|Espeon}} or {{p|Umbreon}} when [[friendship Evolution|leveled up with high friendship]] (220 before [[Generation VIII]] or 160 since) during the [[time|day]]/night, respectively. In a few games without a [[time|clock]], it cannot evolve into Espeon or Umbreon; in {{Pokémon XD}} only, Eevee will evolve if the player has the [[Sun Shard]]/[[Moon Shard]] in their [[Bag]].

Since [[Generation IV]], Eevee can evolve into {{p|Leafeon}} or {{p|Glaceon}} when it levels up near a [[Moss Rock]] or [[Ice Rock]], respectively. Not all games have Moss and Ice Rocks, so since [[Generation VIII]], Eevee can also evolve into Leafeon or Glaceon when exposed to a [[Leaf Stone]] or [[Ice Stone]].

Since [[Generation VI]], Eevee can evolve into {{p|Sylveon}} if it knows a {{type|Fairy}} [[move]] and has high [[affection]] (at least two levels) when it levels up. Since affection was folded into [[friendship]] in [[Generation VIII]], it can evolve if its friendship is at least 160 instead.

If multiple [[Methods of Evolution|evolutionary conditions]] are met simultaneously, {{p|Leafeon}} and {{p|Glaceon}} are prioritized over {{p|Sylveon}}, and Sylveon is prioritized over {{p|Espeon}} and {{p|Umbreon}}.

The {{OBP|Partner Pokémon|Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|partner Eevee}} and Eevee with the {{DL|Gigantamax|Gigantamax Factor}} cannot evolve. Since {{LGPE}} only include the first 151 Pokémon, wild Eevee can only evolve into Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Flareon in those games. Similarly, {{g|Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl}} does not contain Sylveon.

[[File:Eevee Terastal.png|thumb|250px|Tera Eevee in {{aniseries|HZ}}]]
===Main series===
====Major appearances====
=====[[May's Eevee]]=====
In ''[[AG150|May's Egg-Cellent Adventure]]'', {{an|May}} received an {{pkmn|Egg}} from a [[Day-Care Couple]]. That Egg hatched into an Eevee in ''[[AG157|Time Warp Heals All Wounds]]''. Eevee eventually evolved into a {{p|Glaceon}} before May met back up with {{ashfr|the group}} in ''[[DP076|A Full Course Tag Battle!]]''.

=====[[Serena's Eevee]]=====
{{an|Serena}} {{pkmn2|caught}} an Eevee in ''[[XY089|A Frolicking Find in the Flowers!]]''. She later evolved into a {{p|Sylveon}} in ''[[XY105|Party Dancecapades!]]''.

=====[[Sandy]]=====
A male {{pkmn2|wild}} Eevee first appeared in a series of shorts titled [[Where Are You Going, Eevee?]]. The {{DL|Where Are You Going, Eevee?|Episode 1|first episode}} debuted after ''[[SM093|Lillier and the Staff!]]''. He made his animated series debut in ''[[SM099|We Know Where You're Going, Eevee!]]'', where he was caught by {{an|Lana}} and given the [[nickname]] Sandy.

=====[[Gary's Eevee]]=====
In ''[[EP116|The Rivalry Revival]]'', {{Gary}} has an Eevee, which defeated [[Ash's Pikachu]] in battle. It evolved into an {{p|Umbreon}} sometime before ''[[EP171|Power Play!]]''.

=====[[Sakura's Eevee]]=====
[[Sakura]] owned an Eevee in ''[[EP183|Trouble's Brewing]]''. By the time {{Ash}} and his friends met up with Sakura again in ''[[EP226|Espeon, Not Included]]'', her Eevee had evolved into an {{p|Espeon}}.

=====[[Gladion's Eevee]]=====
{{an|Gladion}}'s Eevee appeared in a flashback in ''[[SM027|A Glaring Rivalry!]]''. In the present day, it has evolved into an Umbreon.

=====[[Chloe's Eevee]]=====
[[Chloe]] owns a female Eevee, which she caught in ''[[JN049|To Train, or Not to Train!]]''. She is the first Pokémon that Chloe caught, as her only previous Pokémon, {{TP|Professor Cerise|Yamper}}, was adopted under [[Professor Cerise|her father]]'s ownership. For unknown reasons, she is incapable of evolving, despite the experiments done to her by [[Pinery]] and her assistants at the [[Eevee Evolution Lab]].

=====Other=====
[[File:May Eevee Egg.png|thumb|220px|Eevee {{pkmn|Egg}} in {{aniseries|AG}}]]
Eevee debuted in ''[[EP040|The Battling Eevee Brothers]]'', under the ownership of [[Mikey]], who was hiding it from [[Eevee brothers|his three older brothers]] because they wanted him to evolve it just like they did to their own Eevee. However, when Mikey's Eevee single-handedly defeated {{TRT}}, Sparky, Rainer, and Pyro accepted the fact that Mikey wanted to keep his Eevee just the way it is.

Sadly, this attack isn't incredibly powerful. ''

'''PAL''': ''This adorable Normal-type Pokémon's ability to evolve in so many different ways makes it a popular choice with trainers. When brought out in battle, Eevee uses Take Down on the first opponent it sees, but...it's not very effective. Never mind. Eevee may not be the toughest Pokémon, but it'll always be one of the cutest. ''

==Trivia==
* Eevee's English name is a {{wp|palindrome}}.
** Eevee's English name also contains only two unique characters, less than any other {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}'s English name.
** It is one of five Pokémon whose English name is palindromic, with the other four being {{p|Girafarig}}, {{p|Ho-Oh}}, {{p|Alomomola}}, and {{p|Farigiraf}}.
* Eevee was designed by [[Motofumi Fujiwara]].<ref name=EVs/><ref>[https://twitter.com/atsuko_nishida/status/783643367523557376 Tweet by AtsukoNishida (@atsuko_nishida).] Posted on October 5, 2016.</ref>
* Eevee has the most [[List of Pokémon with branched Evolutions|branched Evolutions]], with a total of eight.
** It was the only Pokémon with branched Evolutions in [[Generation I]].
* Eevee has the most evolved forms of any Pokémon and is the only Pokémon that has more than four evolved forms.
* Only the Generation I evolved forms of Eevee maintain its distinctive ruff in their designs. The later generations' evolved forms drop this motif entirely.
* Eevee is the only Pokémon that evolves with a [[Leaf Stone]] that is not a {{type|Grass}}, as well as the only one to evolve by [[Water Stone]] that is not a {{type|Water}}.
* The fan-made term to describe the Evolutions of Eevee, [[Eeveelution]]s, was made official after its use in the strategy guide for {{g|Stadium 2}}, followed by {{TCG|Eeveelution|a TCG Theme Deck}}.
* In early English promotional material for {{pkmn|Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue}}, Eevee was called "Eon", the suffix of all the evolved forms of Eevee.
* Eevee is the only Pokémon capable of evolving further that cannot evolve into a Pokémon that it shares at least one type with (though {{p|Azurill}} shared this trait prior to it and {{p|Marill}} gaining the {{type|Fairy}} in [[Generation VI]]).
* {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}} and {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}} are the only [[core series]] titles to have the methods of Evolution required for some included {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} be completely unavailable, and Eevee is impacted in both cases.
* Despite Eevee being obtainable before the {{un|Pokémon League}} and Leafeon and Glaceon being included in the [[List of Pokémon by Unova Pokédex number in Pokémon Black 2 and White 2|Unova regional Pokédex]] in {{B2W2}}, it cannot evolve into them until after entering the [[Hall of Fame]]. This is because [[Twist Mountain]] and [[Pinwheel Forest]] are inaccessible before then.
* Eevee is the only pre-existing Pokémon to [[List of cross-generational evolutionary lines|receive an Evolution]] in [[Generation VI]], though many received [[Mega Evolution]]s.
* Four of Eevee's evolved forms evolve through abnormal means in the {{g|Mystery Dungeon series}} ({{p|Espeon}}, {{p|Umbreon}}, {{p|Leafeon}}, and {{p|Glaceon}}).
** In the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series, Eevee evolves using the {{DL|Mystery Dungeon evolutionary items|Sun Ribbon}} or {{DL|Mystery Dungeon evolutionary items|Lunar Ribbon}} with at least 1 star of IQ, a {{DL|Mystery Dungeon evolutionary items|Mossy Rock}}, or a {{DL|Mystery Dungeon evolutionary items|Frozen Rock}} into its respective evolved forms.
* In {{vg|Pokémon Ranger}}, all of Eevee's evolved forms up to the third generation can be captured; however, Eevee is completely unobtainable. This was changed in {{g|Ranger: Shadows of Almia}}.
* Despite the fact that {{an|May}}, {{Gary}}, and [[Sakura]] each owned an Eevee that went on to evolve, Eevee was never seen evolving onscreen in {{aniseries|PTS}} until ''[[DP174|Last Call — First Round!]]'', when [[Ursula]] evolved her two Eevee into {{p|Flareon}} and {{p|Vaporeon}} during a Contest appeal, over thirteen years into the series.
* As a species, Eevee has appeared in the [[Party|teams]] of the most main characters in ''Pokémon the Series'', with {{an|May}}, {{an|Serena}}, and {{an|Lana}} each owning one.
** This also makes Eevee the only Pokémon species in the series to have been owned by more than two different main characters.
* Eevee has more [[signature moves]] than any other Pokémon, with a total of eleven.
* Eevee is the only pre-existing Pokémon to [[List of Pokémon with gender differences|receive a gender difference]] after [[Generation IV]].
* All of [[Eeveelution|Eevee's Evolutions]] up to {{p|Sylveon}} were of types that had been considered [[special moves|special]] before Generation IV. The only special move type not included is the {{t|Dragon}} type.
* Eevee Day is celebrated since 2018 on November 21 (11/21), which is {{wp|goroawase}} for "i-i-bu-i", Eevee's Japanese name. It is certified by the Japan Anniversary Association.<ref name="EeveeDay">[https://twitter.com/project_eevee/status/1065032072761393152 Tweet by 【公式】プロジェクトイーブイ（続） (@project_eevee).] Posted on November 21, 2018.</ref>
* Between {{LGPE}} and {{g|Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl}}, Eevee used its {{pkmn|animated series}} [[cry]] alongside {{p|Pikachu}}. From {{g|Legends: Arceus}} onward, Eevee's cry switched back to its traditional game cry.

===Origin===
In the 2018 artbook ''EVs'', [[Motofumi Fujiwara]] revealed that the idea for Eevee came from [[Satoshi Tajiri]]'s request to have a Pokémon that evolves into multiple types. Fujiwara himself designed Eevee as a "blank slate" for its varied Evolutions; as such, while Eevee has traits of foxes, dogs, and cats, it is not based on any specific animal. Fujiwara also envisioned Eevee as a creature that could exist "in people's memories"; namely, vague memories of seeing a cat or dog-like creature that players might have experienced in their childhood.<ref name=EVs>(2018) ''EVs''. ([http://lavacutcontent.com/ken-sugimori-eevee-origins/ English translation] written by Anthony Madry and commissioned by Dr. Lava)</ref><ref>Morrissy, Kim (September 11, 2018). "[https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2018-09-10/pokemon-designers-reflect-on-history-of-eevee-design/.136529 Pokémon Designers Reflect on History of Eevee's Design]". ''Anime News Network''.</ref>

Eevee's fluffy tail makes its design lean more towards foxes, especially considering that foxes are often seen as shapeshifters in Japanese folklore, which is reflected in the variety of its evolved forms.

====Name origin====
Eevee and Eievui are pronunciations of ''E-V'', the first two letters in the word [[Evolution]].<ref name=EVs/>
