'''Gogoat''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ゴーゴート''' ''Gogoat'') is a {{type|Grass}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation VI]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Skiddo}} starting at [[level]] 32.

==Biology==
[[File:Alexa Gogoat empathetic sense.png|thumb|left|250px|[[Alexa's Gogoat]] sensing [[Tony]]'s feelings through him touching its horns]]
Gogoat is a quadrupedal, hooved {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} similar to a goat. The fur on its face is white with fluffier fur on the chin and the back of its head is dark brown. It has a black nose, red eyes encircled by black markings, a brown blaze down the middle of its face, and rounded ears. On top of its head is a pair of curving black horns that extend over its back. It is covered in shaggy, brown fur that is darker across the back and lighter around the belly and legs. Around its neck is a thick, green leafy mane that extends down its back and ends in a short, bushy tail. The fur on its legs is shorter than the rest of its body; it is dark brown on the upper leg and white around the feet. Each foot ends in a cloven, brownish-orange hoof.

Gogoat has been domesticated by people since 5,000 years ago, and is often used for transport. Gogoat is known to have empathic abilities that allow them to sense the feelings of whoever grips its horns. It does this by sensing subtle changes to the grip, and this ability is so acute that it can move as if it and its rider were one being. In the wild, Gogoat lives in herds in mountainous regions. The leader of the herd is decided through battles with its horns.

Gogoat and its pre-evolved form, {{p|Skiddo}}, are the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Grass Pelt}} as an [[Ability]]. In [[Generation IX]], {{m|Milk Drink}} is Gogoat's [[signature move]].

===Evolution===
Gogoat evolves from {{p|Skiddo}}.

==Trivia==
[[File:Shiny Gogoat Cropped.png|thumb|90px|Gogoat's original Shiny coloration.]]
* Gogoat and its pre-Evolution share their {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Cyclizar}}. They are all known as the Mount Pokémon.
* Gogoat is the [[List of Pokémon with unique base stat totals|only Pokémon]] with a base stat total of 531.
* Gogoat has the highest base {{stat|HP}} stat of all {{type|Grass}} Pokémon.
* In [[Pokémon X and Y beta|pre-release footage]] shown in the E3 developer roundtable, Gogoat's {{Shiny}} form was shown. However, in the final release, its Shiny colors were changed drastically.

===Origin===
Gogoat is based on a {{wp|goat}}, possibly a {{wp|bharal}}, {{wp|Dwarf blue sheep|dwarf bharal}}, {{wp|Bilberry goat|bilberry}}, or {{wp|ibex}} due to its horns, though they also resemble the horns of various {{wp|gazelle}}s and {{wp|antelope}}s. It is also based on a {{wp|motorcycle}}, as it can be ridden and has {{wp|Motorcycle handlebar#Types of handlebar|beach bar}}-like horns. The grass that grows upon it may originate from {{wp|Pan (god)|Pan}} or {{wp|Faunus}}, gods of nature who are half-goat, half-human. The grass could also be a reference to the traditional {{wp|yule goat}} figures in northern Europe made of hay.

====Name origin====
Gogoat may be derived from ''go'', 轟轟 ''gōgō'' (rumbling), and ''goat''.
