'''Alcremie''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''マホイップ''' ''Mawhip'') is a {{type|Fairy}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation VIII]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Milcery}} while holding a [[Sweet]] when the {{player}} spins and strikes a pose or gets dizzy. The [[#Form data|form]] it takes upon evolving depends on the {{DL|Time|Time-based Evolutions|time}} of day, the length of the spin, and whether the Trainer was spinning clockwise or counterclockwise. Its appearance is further determined by the type of Sweet that is held.

<!--Do NOT change the order of the forms, this is the official order.-->
Milcery evolves into:
* '''Vanilla Cream''' Alcremie after spinning clockwise for less than 5 seconds during the day.
* '''Ruby Cream''' Alcremie after spinning counterclockwise for less than 5 seconds during the day.
* '''Matcha Cream''' Alcremie after spinning clockwise for less than 5 seconds at night.
* '''Mint Cream''' Alcremie after spinning counterclockwise for more than 5 seconds at night.
* '''Lemon Cream''' Alcremie after spinning clockwise for more than 5 seconds at night.
* '''Salted Cream''' Alcremie after spinning counterclockwise for less than 5 seconds at night.
* '''Ruby Swirl''' Alcremie after spinning counterclockwise for more than 5 seconds during the day.
* '''Caramel Swirl''' Alcremie after spinning clockwise for more than 5 seconds during the day.
* '''Rainbow Swirl''' Alcremie after spinning in either direction for more than 10 seconds during the evening.
(Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for more details.)

Alcremie has a [[Gigantamax]] form, which is the same regardless of its form. It can Gigantamax into '''Gigantamax Alcremie''' if it has the {{DL|Gigantamax|Gigantamax Factor}}.

==Biology==
Alcremie is a vaguely humanoid {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a body made of whipped cream. Its head resembles several clumps of whipped cream styled like hair, with a large crowning blob flanked by two loop-like "bangs." Each of these bangs is topped with the [[Sweet]] Alcremie was given to hold as a {{p|Milcery}} when evolving. Alcremie's lower body is similarly composed of two dollops of whipped cream resembling a robe or a dress. It has two stout arms with three fingers each extending between the dollops of its body.

When a {{pkmn|Trainer}} gains Alcremie's trust, Alcremie will treat them to {{Berries}} with cream. The content of Alcremie's cream can become richer and sweeter the happier it feels. Due to the cream it makes being very delicious, many pastry chefs seek to have Alcremie as a partner. The cream is said to have an exquisite taste as a result. Alcremie's cream is said to bring happiness anyone who eats them. If attacked, it will throw a sweet-scented cream to distract or blind the opponent in order to escape. The cream's effect is powerful enough to make an opponent soothed and lose the will to battle if eaten.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon-galar-region/alcremie/ Alcremie | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref>

Alcremie is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Decorate}}.

===Forms===
Alcremie has nine major forms as well as a [[Gigantamax]] form.

Alcremie's flavor and color are wildly variable and dependent on the time of day, slight vibrations, direction, and duration for which it was swirled while it was a {{p|Milcery}}. This factor affects Alcremie's cells in the process. An Alcremie's flavor affects the color of its body, which can be any of several pastel shades. Its eye color matches the color of its sweet. There are nine known flavors of Alcremie.

;Gigantamax Alcremie
Gigantamax Alcremie's body resembles a towering, five-tiered cake. The apical tier of the cake resembles Alcremie's regular body, though it's wearing a bow and its whipped-cream "hair" is styled into a flamboyant swoop. The "hair" also extends down the back of the cake like a veil. Each layer of the cake features a variety of sweets that can be used to evolve Milcery. The bottom tier of its body is frosted yellow and adorned with an alternating row of star sweets and dotted frosting. The second tier is frosted pink and features a magenta bow topped with a clover sweet. The third tier is frosted blue and encircled with a row of flower sweets featuring a berry sweet arch. The fourth tier is frosted pink and encircled with love sweets and three red clouds, with the central sweet being larger than the rest. Lumps of whipped cream surround Gigantamax Alcremie's body between each of its tiers. Gigantamax Alcremie's cream is said to be endlessly pouring.

When the cream gets hit by a strong impact, the cream hardens depending on the blow. This allows Gigantamax Alcremie to be resistant to most physical attacks. Moreover, the decorations on Alcremie's body are as hard as diamonds. When attacking, Gigantamax Alcremie unleashes missiles made of cream, each one filled with 100,000 kilocalories. Anyone who gets hit by one of these cream missiles will be filled with energy and euphoria but will become extremely confused and dizzy at the same time.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon-galar-region/alcremie/gigantamax/ Gigantamax Alcremie | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref>

Gigantamax Alcremie is the only known Pokémon capable of using the [[G-Max Move]] {{m|G-Max Finale}}.

===Form data===
Alcremie's form depends on two different parameters: its cream and type of [[sweet]]. Cream affects the color of Alcremie's body, while the sweet affects its eye color and head ornaments. There are nine different types of cream and seven different types of sweet. Any type of cream can be paired with any sweet, resulting in 63 different non-[[Gigantamax]] forms of Alcremie, not including its {{Shiny}} coloration. Each of Alcremie's creams have different menu sprites and [[Pokédex entry|Pokédex entries]], while sweets only affect the appearance of Alcremie's 3D model; all of Alcremie's menu sprites show it with a [[Strawberry Sweet]], regardless of its actual sweet (except in {{g|HOME}}, in which every form has its own menu sprite). The differences between Alcremie's forms are purely aesthetic.

Alcremie's form is non-interchangeable and is decided when it evolves from {{p|Milcery}}. Milcery evolves into Alcremie while holding a sweet when its Trainer spins and strikes a pose while it is in the [[party]]. The type of sweet on Alcremie matches the sweet it was holding, while the cream color varies depending on the [[Time|time of day]], the length of the spin, and whether the Trainer was spinning clockwise or counterclockwise.

All Alcremie forms have access to the same Gigantamax form. Normally, the only Gigantamax Alcremie that can be encountered in [[Max Raid Battle]]s have Vanilla Cream and the Strawberry Sweet. However, all types of cream appeared as Gigantamax Alcremie in limited-time [[Wild Area News]], but only with the Strawberry Sweet. Additionally, Milcery with the Gigantamax Factor were also available in limited-time Wild Area News, enabling players to obtain a Gigantamax Alcremie with any sweet and cream combination. [[Max Soup]] can also be used to give any Alcremie the Gigantamax Factor.

Shiny Alcremie always has the same color, regardless of its actual cream type (which is still visible in its menu sprite).

===Evolution data===
Alcremie [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Milcery}} while holding a [[Sweet]] when the {{player}} spins and strikes a pose (in {{g|Sword and Shield}}) or gets dizzy (in {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}). The [[#Form data|form]] it takes upon evolving depends on the {{DL|Time|Time-based Evolutions|time}} of day, the length of the spin, and whether the Trainer was spinning clockwise or counterclockwise. Its appearance is further determined by the type of Sweet that is held.

<!--Do NOT change the order of the forms, this is the official order.-->
Milcery evolves into:
* Vanilla Cream Alcremie after spinning clockwise for less than 5 seconds during the day.
* Ruby Cream Alcremie after spinning counterclockwise for less than 5 seconds during the day.
* Matcha Cream Alcremie after spinning clockwise for less than 5 seconds at night.
* Mint Cream Alcremie after spinning counterclockwise for more than 5 seconds at night.
* Lemon Cream Alcremie after spinning clockwise for more than 5 seconds at night.
* Salted Cream Alcremie after spinning counterclockwise for less than 5 seconds at night.
* Ruby Swirl Alcremie after spinning counterclockwise for more than 5 seconds during the day.
* Caramel Swirl Alcremie after spinning clockwise for more than 5 seconds during the day.
* Rainbow Swirl Alcremie after spinning in either direction for more than 10 seconds during the evening (between 7:00 and 7:59PM in real-time in {{g|Sword and Shield}}).

==Trivia==
* Alcremie has the most different recognized forms of all {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}, with 64. This consists of nine named forms, each with seven variants corresponding to the type of [[Sweet]], plus a Gigantamax form.
** Despite having the most different recognized forms, Alcremie only has nine [[Pokédex entry|Pokédex entries]] (one for each named form), making it the Pokémon with the second-most [[Pokédex entry|Pokédex entries]] for a single Pokémon as of [[Generation IX]], behind {{p|Vivillon}}.
* Prior to the release of {{g|HOME}}, Alcremie was tied with {{p|Minior}} as being under the most [[Pokédex]] [[List of Pokémon by color|color]] groupings, with a total of six. The distinction is now held by Vivillon, with nine Pokédex color groupings.
* Alcremie was designed by [[Atsuko Nishida]].<ref>[https://www.instagram.com/p/B5EnBIaAzFz/ Comment on an Instagram post by Atsuko Nishida (@coloatsu).] Posted on November 20, 2019.</ref>

===Origin===
Alcremie appears to be based on whipped cream, or {{wp|Eton mess}}, a British dessert made of fruit, meringue, and whipped cream. Its [[Gigantamax]] form may be based on a {{wp|wedding cake}}.

====Name origin====
Alcremie may be a combination of ''{{wp|alchemy}}'' and ''cream'', ''crème'', or ''creamy''.

Mawhip may be a combination of 魔法 ''mahō'' (magic) and ホイップ ''hoippu'' (whip, as in whipped cream).
