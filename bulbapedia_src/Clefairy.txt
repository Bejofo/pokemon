'''Clefairy''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ピッピ''' ''Pippi'') is a {{type|Fairy}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]]. Prior to [[Generation VI]], it was a {{type|Normal}} Pokémon.

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Cleffa}} when [[friendship Evolution|leveled up with high friendship]] and evolves into {{p|Clefable}} when exposed to a [[Moon Stone]].

==Biology==
[[File:Clefairy floating.png|thumb|200px|left|Clefairy floating]]
Clefairy is a bipedal, pink {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a chubby, vaguely star-shaped body. A small, pointed tooth protrudes from the upper left corner of its mouth. It has wrinkles beside its black, oval eyes, a single dark pink oval marking on each cheek, and large, pointed ears with brown tips. A tuft of fur curls over its forehead, much like its large, upward-curling tail. Each stocky arm has two small claws and a thumb on each hand, and both feet have a single toenail. There is a pair of tiny, butterfly-shaped wings on its back. Though incapable of flight, Clefairy's wings can store moonlight and allow it to float.

Clefairy is very shy and rarely shows itself to humans. On the rare occasions that Clefairy comes down from its {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Mountain Pokémon|mountain home}}, it can be seen dancing underneath the full moon's light. The area surrounding their dance is enveloped in a magnetic field. Once the sun rises, it returns home, where it sleeps nestled with other Clefairy. There have been many sightings of Clefairy during the morning aftermath of the full moon. In the ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' episode ''[[EP062|Clefairy Tales]]'', Clefairy is depicted as an [[extraterrestrial Pokémon]]. Clefairy is known to be popular thanks to both its adorable look and behavior. As mentioned in [[Pokémon Sleep]], anyone who sees a Clefairy using {{m|Metronome}} while sleeping will receive happiness. This sighting is considered to be a very unusual sight to witness.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref>

Before [[Generation V]], Clefairy and its evolutionary relatives were the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that could have {{a|Magic Guard}} as an [[Ability]].

[[File:Clefairy leader.png|thumb|250px|Clefairy in {{aniseries|GS}}]]
===Main series===
====Major appearances====
=====Clefairy (recurring)=====
A peculiar group of Clefairy debuted in ''[[EP062|Clefairy Tales]]''. {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} first encountered them after their spacecraft crash-landed near [[Viridian City]]. The Clefairy resorted to stealing items, including {{an|Jigglypuff}}'s signature microphone marker and even {{AP|Pikachu}}, from a nearby town to rebuild their spaceship.

The group, accompanied by [[Oswald]] and Jigglypuff, tracked the Clefairy to an underground cave and stormed the spaceship to recover Jigglypuff's microphone and Pikachu. Though Jigglypuff ended up defeating all of the Clefairy with {{m|Pound}}, the spacecraft still took off because of its preset launch, though Ash, his friends, and Jigglypuff escaped in time. Oswald remained on board until the spaceship crashed again in another village. As a result, the Clefairy once again began stealing the locals' items to return to orbit.

The Clefairy reappeared in ''[[EP246|Wish Upon a Star Shape]]'', where the group re-encountered them after their spacecraft crashed into a [[Johto]] mountainside. Prior to the crash-landing, the Clefairy beamed a {{p|Cleffa}} to safety, and it landed on [[Ash's Phanpy]]. Cleffa quickly struck up a friendship with Phanpy. It later led everyone to the crash site while also trying to escape {{TRT}} and the [[Pokémon Mystery Club]] (PMC).

The Clefairy went on to use the parts from [[Team Rocket's mechas|Team Rocket's mecha]] and the PMC's machine to repair their spacecraft. Pikachu's {{m|Thunderbolt}} ultimately helped the craft lift off. In the process, Cleffa [[Evolution|evolved]] into a Clefairy and reunited with its family.

Its known moves are {{m|Light Screen}}, {{m|Double Slap}}, and {{m|Pound}}.

{{main|Clefairy (TCG)}}

==Other appearances==
===[[Super Smash Bros.]]===
When released from a {{i|Poké Ball}}, Clefairy will use {{m|Metronome}} to copy another Pokémon's move randomly.

According to an interview with Masahiro Sakurai, the director of the Super Smash Bros. series, in the May 1999 issue of The 64 DREAM, both Clefairy and [[Jigglypuff]] were considered to be added to the game as a clone of Kirby, with Jigglypuff ultimately being chosen for the game.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/64dream-may-1999-ozidual/64Dream%201999%2005%20%28J%20OCR%29/page/n91/mode/2up?view=theater The 64 DREAM May 1999, p. 91]. ところで、「どうして隠しキャラにプリンが?」っていう意見もあったりするんですが。 / ふつうの格闘ゲームは、基本になる骨格などを一緒に作って、やられるモーションなども使いまわすことができるんです。でも「スマブラ」の場合は基本の8キャラがすべて異なる体型で作られているんですね。その上、やられパターンとか倒れパターン、それに起き上がりら攻撃パターンや崖捕まりパターンなど、それぞれ違う作りをしていて、それらを全て作るのは、ふつうの格闘っていうレベルでみてもすごく大変なことなんです。それで、隠れキャラは基本キャラの骨格を使い回すことを前提にしたんです。なので、ネスとルイージはマリオと同じ骨格でできてるし、ファルコンはサムス、プリンはカービィと一緒というわけなんです。プリンを選んだのはそういった骨格の類似性もありましたが、それとは別に、「人気ポケモンは?」って考えたときに、最後まで残ったのがピッピとプリンだったんですね。カービィ体形でピッピを作ることも可能だったと思いますけど、とりあえずキャラクター的な性格からして、プリンの方がやられ役っぽさがあったので選びました。</ref>

===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]===
Clefairy reappears in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', although Metronome has been modified to consist of four, random attacks:

*{{m|Gust}}: Any character caught in the whirlwind will take heavy amount of damage, but not enough to KO them. This can be SDI'd out of, allowing characters to escape or reduce damage taken.
*{{m|Fire Spin}}: This attack burns the ground around Clefairy, damaging any opponent caught in it. Like Gust, this can be SDI'd out of.
*{{m|Waterfall}}: This attack has high vertical knockback, large range, and hits many times, to the point that it can KO a character.
*{{m|Self-Destruct}}: This attack is similar to [[Electrode]]'s Explosion. Any character caught in the blast radius will take damage.

As in ''Smash 64'', the summoner is immune to damage from Clefairy's attacks, including Self-Destruct. Its Japanese voice clip comes from a different part of ''Clefairy and the Moon Stone'' while its English voice clip is the same one used in ''Smash 64''.

====Trophy information====
''Clefairy are very cute Pokémon, which makes them popular pets. However, as they're only found in a few areas, it takes a lot of work to find one. Strangely enough, legend has it that Clefairy are more active during the full moon. These Pokémon are known to use Metronome, a move that unleashes a randomly selected technique.''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Clefairy appears as a {{sbw|Spirits (characters)|Spirit}}.

==Trivia==
* The [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|prototype name]] for Clefairy was ''Aria''. The {{pmin|Russia}}n [[dub]] of ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' used this name during the [[original series]].
** The {{pmin|Poland|Polish}} dub of the episode ''[[EP006|Clefairy and the Moon Stone]]'' calls Clefairy by its proper species name and "Aria" interchangeably.
* Clefairy and its evolved form [[List of categories by abundance|share]] their {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Snubbull}} and {{p|Granbull}}. They are all known as the Fairy Pokémon.
** The "Fairy Pokémon" category predates the introduction of the {{type|Fairy}} in [[Generation VI]]. From this generation onwards, the type and category of these four Pokémon share the same English name. However, this is not true in Japanese, where the type is フェアリータイプ ''Fairy-type'' and the category is ようせいポケモン ''Yōsei Pokémon''.
* The [[Poké Doll]] is a Clefairy doll, as identified by the Japanese name of this item (ピッピにんぎょう ''{{tt|Pippi|Clefairy}} Doll'').

===Concept and development===
According to an interview, Clefairy was designed by [[Ken Sugimori]], and is one of [[Kōji Nishino]]'s favorite Pokémon.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20211108083831/https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/creator-profile-the-creators-of-pikachu/ Creator Profile: The Creators of Pikachu - Pokémon.com] (archived)</ref>

===Origin===
Clefairy seems to be based on {{wp|fairy|fairies}} and {{wp|pixie}}s since it is a playful, magical, humanoid creature with wings. It may also be inspired by the concept of {{wp|extraterrestrial life}} due to its rumored celestial origins and vaguely {{wp|star}}-shaped body. It may also reference the mythical {{wp|Moon rabbit}} due to its large ears, various Moon related powers, and the fact that it evolves into Clefable using a [[Moon Stone]].

====Name origin====
Clefairy may be a combination of ''{{wp|clef}}'' (musical symbol) and ''{{wp|fairy}}''.

Pippi may be derived from the repetition of the first syllable of ''{{wp|pixie}}''.
