'''Chansey''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ラッキー''' ''Lucky'') is a {{type|Normal}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Happiny}} when [[level]]ed up while holding an [[Oval Stone]] during the [[Time-based Evolution|day]] and evolves into {{p|Blissey}} when [[friendship Evolution|leveled up with high friendship]].

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for these details.)

==Biology==
[[File:GO sticker Feb2024 Chansey2.png|thumb|left|200px|Chansey sharing its egg with an injured {{p|Happiny}}]]
Chansey is a pink, ovoid {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with stubby arms and dark pink feet. It has tiny eyes and three hair-like growths on each side of its head. The tufts of hair have dark pink tips. On the center of its belly is a dark pink pouch that contains a single white egg. The egg is said to be very nutritious and it lays several new ones every day. Finally, it has a short tail. Chansey is a female-only species with no male counterpart.

A kindhearted Pokémon, Chansey will share its eggs with injured people and Pokémon. However, Chansey will never share its egg to those with evil hearts. The eggs become more delicious if Chansey is raised with love and care. Chansey's egg is used as a high-class cooking ingredient due to the nutrition it has. As a result, Chansey have been referred to as ''doctors' doubles'' because of its eggs. Due to its egg being over-harvested, Chansey is extremely rare in the wild and is said to bring good luck and happiness to those who manage to catch it. Fleeing from those seeking its egg has made this once-slow species much quicker on its feet than in the past. It is more commonly found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Urban Pokémon|urban settings}}. Chansey is the only known Pokémon capable of using the [[Lucky Punch]] item. In {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, if the player is injured, any nearby Chansey will come to check them out, and then flee when they're fully healed. They don't actually heal the player, however. As mentioned in [[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]], Chansey has been observed sleeping while holding its egg carefully. It is believed Chansey is doing this to prevent its egg from cracking. Chansey has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: ''Seated Sleep'', ''Nodding-Off Sleep'', ''Egg-Minding Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''.

Chansey and its evolutionary relatives are the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Soft-Boiled}} by leveling up.

===Evolution data===
Chansey [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Happiny}} when [[level]]ed up while holding an [[Oval Stone]] during the [[Time-based Evolution|day]] and evolves into {{p|Blissey}} when leveled up with high [[friendship]]. Chansey cannot evolve into Blissey in {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}} before the player obtains the [[National Pokédex]], as the Evolution will be interrupted. Chansey also cannot evolve into Blissey in {{LGPE}}, as Blissey is not present in those games. In {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, Chansey evolves from Happiny when exposed to an Oval Stone during the day.

===Pokémon Zensho===
A Chansey appeared in [[PZ06]].

{{Zensho|Shigeru}} has a Chansey, which he caught in the {{safari|Kanto}}.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Chansey (TCG)}}

==Other appearances==
===[[Super Smash Bros.]]===
Chansey will sometimes appear from the Silph Co. Building in Saffron City, and can also be released from a {{i|Poké Ball}} in which case she will shoot out eggs.

===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]===
When released from a Poké Ball, Chansey will use {{m|Soft-Boiled}} and produce five eggs. Anyone can pick them up and they will either slightly heal the holder or contain items. If attacked, Chansey can be knocked away, stopping egg production.

In the [[Poké Floats]] stage, Chansey also makes an appearance as a Poké Float. The float will quickly bob up and down from the bottom of the screen four times.

====Trophy information====
''"Renowned for its kind temperament, Chansey has been known to offer injured creatures a highly nutritious egg to aid their recovery. Legend has it that this charitable creature brings friendship to anyone who captures a Chansey. All Chansey are female, and every now and then one is found in possession of a [[Lucky Egg]]."''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Chansey appears as a {{sbw|Spirit}} and as a stage hazard in the retuning Saffron City stage

==Trivia==
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Chansey was originally known as "Lucky", which also happens to be its romanized Japanese name.
* Chansey shares its {{pkmn|category}} name with {{p|Exeggcute}}. They are both known as the Egg Pokémon.
* Chansey received the biggest decrease to its {{stat|Special}} stats in [[Generation II]], losing 70 points of its {{stat|Special Attack}} stat.
* Chansey's [[HP]] increase is the largest single stat increase after evolving from {{p|Happiny}}, at 150 points.
* Chansey is tied with Happiny for the lowest base {{stat|Attack}} and {{stat|Defense}} stats of all Pokémon, both at five.
* Chansey's HP is the highest base stat to base stat total ratio. Its HP stat of 250 makes up approximately 55.6% of its base stat total.
* Chansey, {{p|Porygon2}}, and {{p|Dipplin}} are the only non-fully [[Evolution|evolved]] Pokémon that evolve from another Pokémon through the use of an [[Evolution item|item]].

===Origin===
Chansey's name across languages, the fact that it shares nutritious eggs, its rarity, and its ability to run very quickly and evade people all suggest it may be based on the concept of {{wp|luck}} and its elusiveness. It also serves the typical {{wp|role-playing game}} role of a {{wp|medic}}.

Chansey's tendency to carry {{wp|egg}}s in a pouch is very reminiscent of a {{wp|monotreme}} (mainly the {{wp|echidna}}s) or {{wp|marsupial}}, but it may also simply be based on a general concept of females and motherhood. As the [[Pokédex]] mentions its frequent laying of nutritious eggs, Chansey may also be based on {{wp|chicken}}s or other {{wp|poultry}}, and its "ears" give it the semblance of an {{wp|axolotl}}.

====Name origin====
Chansey may be from either ''chance'' or ''chancy''.

Lucky is literally ''lucky''.
