'''Eiscue''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''コオリッポ''' ''Korippo'') is an {{type|Ice}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation VIII]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Eiscue has two [[#Form data|forms]], '''Ice Face''' and '''Noice Face''', which it can switch between with its {{a|Ice Face}} [[Ability]].

(Refer to [[#Form data|Game data&rarr;Form data]] for more details.)

==Biology==
[[File:875Eiscue Dream - Noice 3.png|thumb|left|150px|Eiscue in its Noice Face form as ice reforms on its head]]
Eiscue is a medium-sized, {{wp|penguin}}-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a large ice cube encasing its head. This ice cube is a light blue, with specks of white seen dotting the surface of it. Two oval-shaped eyes and a beak are seen on the front of the cube. It also has a long, antennae-like hair sticking out of the cube. Eiscue's body is black and white with light blue accents around its belly. It has two flippers and yellow feet, with three toes on each. Its true face within the ice is colored light blue with two white eyes, black eyebrows and a white beak, and has a worried expression to it.

Eiscue comes from extremely cold areas. It can produce cold air from inside its head to create ice to protect its head from heat. The ice, however, is not very durable, as a strong blow can shatter it, after which it goes on to create new ice. The ice starts to form around its hair first. Eiscue is easygoing by nature. It is a poor swimmer, and is often seen aimlessly floating in the ocean with just its ice-covered head floating on the surface, occasionally washing up on distant shores. It never panics or gets upset whenever it ends up in a new land, instead continuing due to its ability to adapt.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon-galar-region/eiscue/ Eiscue | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref> The ice on Eiscue's head has a mild salty taste, presumed to be caused by it having floated in the oceans. When the weather is hot, groups of Eiscue will cool each other down by pressing their ice cube heads together. Eiscue's hair is connected to the surface of its brain, which then chills the air around it when it has something on its mind. Eiscue also uses its hair to catch prey in the sea, by forming ice balls at the tip and dipping it into the water like a fishing line.

Eiscue is the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Ice Face}} as an [[Ability]].

===Form data===
Eiscue has two interchangeable forms: Ice Face and Noice Face. It switches between them with its [[Ability]] {{a|Ice Face}}. It will always be in its Ice Face form outside of {{pkmn|battle}}.

Eiscue starts battles in its Ice Face form. When it is hit by a [[physical move]], it does not take damage and instead transforms into its Noice Face form. In this form, it has decreased {{stat|Defense}} and {{stat|Special Defense}} and increased {{stat|Speed}}, and it can be damaged by normal means. When in Noice Face form, Eiscue will change back to its Ice Face form if {{weather|hail}} or [[snow]] begins while it is on the field, or if it is sent out into battle while it is hailing or snowing.

==Trivia==
* Eiscue shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Piplup}} and {{p|Prinplup}}. They are all known as the Penguin Pokémon.
* Eiscue can be seen as a parallel to {{p|Stonjourner}}. 
** They are {{pkmn2|version-exclusive|version exclusives}} of each other: Eiscue is exclusive to {{pkmn|Sword and Shield|Shield}} and {{pkmn|Scarlet and Violet|Violet}}, while Stonjourner is exclusive to Sword and Scarlet. 
** They both have [[Signature Ability|signature Abilities]]: Eiscue has {{a|Ice Face}}, while Stonjourner has {{a|Power Spot}}.
** The version-exclusive [[Gym Leader]]s of [[Circhester Stadium]], [[Gordie]]{{sup/8|Sw}} and [[Melony]]{{sup/8|Sh}}, use Stonjourner and Eiscue in their respective teams.
* Due to a [[Rollout storage glitch|glitch]], if Eiscue is hit by {{m|Rollout}}, the [[damage]] multiplier for it can also be applied to other [[move]]s. Eiscue shares this trait with {{p|Mimikyu}}. This was fixed in Version 1.3.1 of {{g|Sword and Shield}}.

===Origin===
Eiscue seems to be based on a {{wp|penguin}} with an {{wp|ice cube}} for a head. It may also draw inspiration from the {{wp|great auk}}, a {{wp|flightless bird}} that used to inhabit the coasts of {{wp|Northern Atlantic}}, including the {{wp|British Isles}}, before their extinction. Many of Eiscue's behaviors are similar to the biology and history of the great auk: they would float with their heads exposed above water, their heads would get whiter during the winter season, and they were hunted to be used as fish bait.

====Name origin====
Eiscue may be a combination of ''Eis'' (German for ice) and ''ice cube''.

Korippo may be a combination of 氷 ''kōri'' (ice) and 立方 ''rippō'' (cube).
