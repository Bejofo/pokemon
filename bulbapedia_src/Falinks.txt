'''Falinks''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''タイレーツ''' ''Tairetsu'') is a {{type|Fighting}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation VIII]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

==Biology==
[[File:870Falinks Dream 5.png|220px|thumb|left|Falinks in the Column formation]]
Falinks is a group of small, bipedal {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. A single Falinks is a formation of six individuals, similar to {{p|Exeggcute}}. It consists of five troopers and a leader, known as "the brass". Falinks usually march in a single file line headed by the brass, giving their formation the appearance of a caterpillar. This formation is known as the Column formation. However, Falinks occasionally break their formation to attack.

The six members rely on teamwork as their strategy to win battles, and constantly change formation when they fight. The five troopers follow their brass loyally, and the brass's orders are considered absolute by them. Falinks are capable of fitting into small holes, as shown in {{rt|8|Galar}}, where they can be seen marching and charging through small caves and crevices. A common formation that the members change into is a form in which the troopers stand in a triangular formation around the brass, either in front of or behind it. This formation is known as the No Retreat formation, as the members stand in this formation when using the move {{m|No Retreat}}. In {{aniseries|JN}}, the six individual Falinks are shown to occasionally stand upon one another to execute certain moves. In {{g|UNITE}}, it is shown that the brass may also dispatch troopers to attack on their own, with this strategy being known as the Dispatch formation.

An individual Falinks trooper has a black, spherical body with two stout, trunk-like legs. They also have blue, ovular eyes which can either be interpreted as being white or glowing slightly from their dark body. Each trooper has a golden, armored shell resembling a Spartan helmet that covers their dorsal half. This shell is topped with a red horn that continues into a small crest. The lateral sides of the trooper are protected by two horned plates resembling shields. Each of these shields features a red, central horn ringed in white. Each trooper also has a small red horn on their posterior resembling a tail.

The Falinks brass is the largest, strongest, and most intelligent out of the six members. It has a larger crest with an extendable horn it uses to attack and issue orders. The horn is supported by a golden anterior strut absent in the troopers. The brass's golden shell extends to the ventral half of its body. Unlike its troopers, the brass's lateral shields can be opposed. The brass's shields are often chipped or nicked. When Falinks is marching in formation, the brass holds its two shields in front of its face.

Falinks is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|No Retreat}}.

==Trivia==
* Falinks is the only {{type|Fighting}} Pokémon in the {{egg|Mineral}} [[Egg Group]], and the only Fighting-type Pokémon [[List of Pokémon by shape#Pokémon consisting of multiple bodies|to consist of multiple bodies]].
* Despite {{stat|Special Defense}} being its lowest stat, Falinks awards Special Defense {{EV}}s when it is defeated.
* Falinks was designed by [[Yusuke Kozaki]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/kymg/status/1341384533459910656 Tweet by コザキユースケ/Yusuke Kozaki (@kymg).] Posted on December 22, 2020.</ref>
* As seen in ''[[JN073|Grabbing the Brass Ring!]]'', Falinks troopers have the ability to mimic the [[cry]] of other Pokémon.

===Origin===
Falinks may be inspired by groups of soldiers in {{wp|phalanx}} formations, where each unit is lined up close together and cover all sides with their shields, which Falinks's limbs resemble. Their heads resemble {{wp|Corinthian helmet}}s worn by hoplites during the period of {{wp|Ancient Greece}}, adorned with golden plates and red crests. It may also be inspired by the {{wp|Legio IX Hispana}}, also known as the 9th Roman Legion or the Lost Legion, which mysteriously disappeared in Britain around 120 AD. Falinks' presence in the [[Paldea Pokédex]] may be a reference to the Legio IX Hispana itself. Its Paldea Pokédex number being #300 may be a reference to the {{wp|Battle of Thermopylae}}, where {{wp|Leonidas I}} kept 300 {{wp|Spartan}}s in his army to guard their retreat after dismissing the bulk of the Greek army.

It may also take inspiration from {{wp|eusociality}}, a kind of social animal behavior found in certain insects, crustaceans, and mammals characterized by, among other things, the division of labor of the members of the colony, which are sometimes called castes, like soldiers, workers, and the queen. In Falinks's case, the castes are the troopers and the brass.

In addition, Falinks is possibly a visual pun on an admiral caterpillar.

====Name origin====
Falinks may be a combination of ''{{wp|phalanx}}'', ''family'', ''link'' (chain link), and ''"fall in"'' (fall in line).

Tairetsu may be derived from 隊列 ''tairetsu'' (a rank or formation of troops).
