'''Glastrier''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ブリザポス''' ''Blizzapos'') is an {{type|Ice}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced during [[Generation VIII]], in [[The Crown Tundra]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

Glastrier can be [[Pokémon fusion|ridden]] with {{p|Calyrex}} using the [[Reins of Unity]] to become {{fd|Calyrex|Ice Rider Calyrex}}.

==Biology==
[[File:898Calyrex Dream - Glastrier.png|thumb|left|150px|[[Pokémon fusion|Ridden]] by {{Form|Calyrex|Ice Rider}} {{p|Calyrex}}]]
Glastrier is an equine {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a white coat and has light-blue ice covering parts of its body. Its mane consists of ice spikes, with three rows behind its neck and a single large spike between its ears. Both have ice behind them, connecting to the mask of ice that covers the left side of its face, which is noted to be 100 times harder than diamond. Its eyes are white with no visible pupils. Its thin tail is covered in ice that has four spikes jutting out from the sides. Its legs have ice covering its hooves and {{wp|fetlock}}s, with the ice on its forelegs extending to the knees.

Glastrier possesses incredible physical strength and extraordinary destructive power. It is noted to be an aggressive Pokémon that forcefully takes anything it wants. Glastrier generates extremely cold air within its body and emits it from its nose and hooves. While Glastrier cannot move fast, it can freeze the ground to allow it to slide across the ice in a flash. Glastrier's legs allows it to travel through the snowiest of lands and worst of roads. It enjoys challenging any strong opponents it finds worthy of battling.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/expansionpass/pokemon/glastrier/ Glastrier | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref>

Glastrier was known to be very proud and arrogant, preferring to serve those it deems the strongest. It once ruled over the [[Crown Tundra]] like a lord, terrorizing its residents for intruding on its territory.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/expansionpass/pokemon/united-by-their-bonds/ Pokémon united by their bonds | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref> This lasted until it was defeated and tamed by {{ga|Calyrex}} using the [[Reins of Unity]]. Glastrier has a fondness for [[Carrot Seeds|carrots]], particularly [[Iceroot Carrot]]s. It also loves [[Glastrier Treat]]s made by [[Snacksworth]], who once encountered it in the past.

By combining with Calyrex, Glastrier can channel a cold temperature up to −508&nbsp;°F (−300&nbsp;°C).<ref>[https://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/sword_shield_expansion/pokemon/201106_03/ Budrex (White Horse Riding Form) | "Pocket Monsters Sword ・ Shield Expansion Pass" Official Website] (Japanese)</ref> The cold temperature allows Calyrex's psychic abilities to reach their full power, with a range of at least 30 miles. Glastrier's endurance also increases to the point it can run up to seven days and nights. This allows the powered up steed and Ice Rider Calyrex to smash and freeze anything in its path no matter the difficulty of the road. Glastrier's intense cold can be channeled into gigantic icicles, by combining Ice Rider Calyrex's psychic powers. The icicles is powerful enough to blow holes in rocky mountains, allowing the Glastrier to travel through it completely along with Ice Rider Calyrex.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/expansionpass/pokemon/ice-rider-calyrex/ Ice Rider Calyrex | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref>

Glastrier is the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Chilling Neigh}} as its [[Ability]].

==Trivia==
* Glastrier's {{stat|Attack}} and {{stat|Special Attack}} stats are the reverse of {{p|Spectrier}}'s.
* Glastrier and Spectrier are the only Pokémon introduced in the [[Crown Tundra]] that were not directly revealed to the public.

===Origin===
Glastrier together with Spectrier may also be based on the {{wp|Horsehead Nebula}}, a horse-shaped nebula near the constellation {{wp|Orion}}. Glastrier itself may also be based on the {{wp|Monoceros}} (unicorn) constellation, which also borders Orion. This would correspond to Calyrex possibly representing Orion itself or {{wp|Lepus (constellation)|Lepus}}, the "hare" constellation located right below Orion, as well as Zacian and Zamazenta possibly representing {{wp|Canis Major}}, which borders both Monoceros and Lepus.

Both Glastrier and its counterpart {{p|Spectrier}}'s relationship with Calyrex appears to be based on the legend of {{wp|Brian Boru}} and the {{wp|Pooka}}. Legend has it that Brian Boru, the High King of Ireland, is the only person to have ever ridden a Pooka, a mischievous faery in the form of a black horse. Brian tamed the Pooka by using a special bridle that contained three hairs from the Pooka's tail and successfully staying on its back through a wild ride. The king then forced the Pooka not to torment Christian people and to never attack an Irishman ever again. This is similar to how Calyrex, a Pokémon known as a king, can only ride its loyal steed, Glastrier or Spectrier, using the Reins of Unity woven in part from hairs from the steed's mane and had to prove itself by riding through the steed's bucking. It also relates to how, in taming this steed, Calyrex stopped the steed Pokémon from tormenting the people of the Crown Tundra.

The appearance of Glastrier may be based on the {{wp|unicorn}}, the national animal of Scotland – which is the country that the Crown Tundra is based on. The unicorn in mythology is also said to be extremely wild and can only be tamed by the pure of heart; Glastrier is noted to be very aggressive and only the graceful Calyrex was able to tame it. It may also be based on {{wp|Shire horse}}s and {{wp|Clydesdale horse}}s, draft horse breeds from Britain. Its large ice-covered hooves may be a stylization of the horse breeds' large {{wp|feathering (horse)|feathered}} hooves.

Glastrier may draw inspiration from legendary horses in {{wp|Celtic mythology}}, such as {{wp|Hengroen}}, a stallion owned by King Arthur in the Welsh tale {{wp|Culhwch and Olwen}}, or {{wp|Liath Macha and Dub Sainglend|Liath Macha}}, a grey-colored chariot horse owned by the hero {{wp|Cú Chulainn}} in the {{wp|Ulster Cycle}} of {{wp|Irish Mythology}}. In addition, its tail shape may be a reference to an equestrian tail guard worn over the {{wp|Rump (animal)|dock}} of a military or sport horse, leaving the tail fan spreading. It may also take inspiration from other {{wp|water horse}}s in Celtic and Nordic folklore, such as the nykur, the water horse of Iceland and the Faroe Islands. This water horse is said to be white in color, and according to Icelanders, the sound of ice cracking on frozen lakes is the sound of the nykur's neighing, which may also connect to Glastrier's Ability, {{a|Chilling Neigh}}. It also bears similarity to {{wp|Glashtyn}}, a water horse or {{wp|goblin}} of Manx folklore whose name derives from ''glas(s)'', the Celtic word for 'stream'. The Glashtyn is sometimes called the "Howler", because its eerie cry is said to warn of approaching storms, which may also be referenced by Glastrier's Ability. The Glashtyn is also said to fear fire, which Glastrier is weak to due to its Ice typing.

Alternatively, Glastrier may draw inspiration from the mythological ''{{wp|Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse}}'', Glastrier representing the white horse of Conquest given its belligerent nature and purported desire to take anything it wants by force. It may also be based on the white-colored knight chess piece. Together with Spectrier, it may also be partly inspired by ''{{wp|Ema (Shinto)|Ema}}'' plaques and horse effigies in Shinto shrines that pray for good harvest.

====Name origin====
Glastrier may be a combination of ''glacier'' and ''{{wp|destrier}}'', a type of medieval war horse.

Blizzapos may be a combination of ''blizzard'' and ἵππος ''híppos'' (Greek for horse) or ''horse''.
