'''Blastoise''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''カメックス''' ''Kamex'') is a {{type|Water}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Wartortle}} starting at [[level]] 36. It is the final form of {{p|Squirtle}}.

Blastoise has two forms: '''Mega Blastoise''' and '''Gigantamax Blastoise'''. It can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Blastoise using the [[Blastoisinite]], and can [[Gigantamax]] into Gigantamax Blastoise if it has the {{DL|Gigantamax|Gigantamax Factor}}. Gigantamax Blastoise was introduced in [[The Isle of Armor]].

Blastoise is the [[game mascot]] of the [[Pokémon Blue Version (Japanese)|Japanese]] and international versions of [[Pokémon Red and Blue Versions|Pokémon Blue]], appearing on the boxart of both games.

==Biology==
[[File:Blastoise shell anime.png|thumb|left|200px|Blastoise inside its shell]]
Blastoise is a large, bipedal {{wp|turtle}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. Its body is blue and is mostly hidden by its tough, brown shell. This shell has a cream-colored underside and a white ridge encircling its arms and separating the upper and lower halves. Two powerful water cannons/jet nozzles reside at the top of its shell over its shoulders. These cannons can be extended or withdrawn. Blastoise's head has triangular ears that are black on the inside, small brown eyes, and a cream-colored lower jaw. Its arms are thick, and it has three claws on each hand. Its feet have three claws on the front and one on the back. Poking out of the bottom of its shell is a stubby tail.

The powerful cannons on this Pokémon's back can produce water blasts that can pierce steel and concrete and be used for high-speed charges. The speed of Blastoise's charges is similar to the force of a rocket. Blastoise makes itself heavy to withstand these powerful blasts and crush its opponents. It is shown in the ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' episode ''[[EP060|Beach Blank-Out Blastoise]]'' that Blastoise can take the role of a leader in large groups of {{p|Squirtle}} and {{p|Wartortle}}. Its preferred habitat seems to be {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Water's Edge Pokémon|freshwater ponds and lakes}}. Blastoise is capable of flying by propelling itself with water from the back openings of its shell. As shown in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Blastoise is known to sleep soundly while protected by its tough shell.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref> Blastoise has also been seen sleeping with its belly exposed on very rare occasions. This is due to Blastoise feeling completely secure in its surroundings and quickly falling asleep. Blastoise has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: ''Sheltered Sleep'', ''Unsheltered Sleep'', ''Overturned Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''.

In [[Generation II]], Blastoise and its pre-evolved forms were the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Skull Bash}} naturally, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via {{pkmn|breeding}}.

===Forms===
Blastoise has two forms: Mega Blastoise and [[Gigantamax]] Blastoise.

;Mega Blastoise
When [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolved]], Blastoise develops two smaller shells over its arms, each with its own water cannon. Small ridges develop over its now-red eyes and extend to its ears — which angle slightly backward — and there is a small point on its chin. The two cannons on its back merge into a single, central water cannon of greater size that extends forward over Mega Blastoise's head and can retract back into its shell. 

This main cannon has power equivalent to that of a tank gun at minimum and possesses a blast range of over 6 miles (10 kilometers). Mega Blastoise's strengthened legs and back enable it to withstand the recoil from its own blasts, but it can also use its arm cannons to further support itself by using moves such as {{m|Ice Beam}} to latch itself to the ground before firing a massive attack, such as during its Burst Attack in [[Pokkén Tournament]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150329055725/http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/pokemon/mega_pokemon/ Pokémon X and Y site | Mega Pokémon (archived)]</ref>

[[File:009Blastoise-Gigantamax 2.png|thumb|left|250px|Gigantamax Blastoise shooting streams of water from its cannons]]
;Gigantamax Blastoise
As Gigantamax Blastoise, it becomes larger. Its eyes are white with bright blue sclerae. Its blue arms, head, and legs change to light blue, and the underside of its shell becomes dark red. Its shell becomes darker and transforms into a battleship-like formation, with 31 cannons of different sizes: sets of twin cannons emerge from hexagon and rectangle-shaped holes within the shell, and a main cannon protrudes from the center. Several white triangular spots are located on its tail and legs. Three red clouds surround the main cannon.

Gigantamax Blastoise can adapt to any situation using various cannon combinations. It is not very good at precision shooting, so instead of aiming its attacks, it prefers to overwhelm its opponent by launching dynamic, powerful torrents from its cannons. According to one legend, its main cannon is so staggeringly powerful that it can blast holes through the mountains. Gigantamax Blastoise can also individually align the 12 cannons surrounding its main cannon to attack in any direction.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/expansionpass/pokemon/gigantamax-blastoise/ Gigantamax Blastoise | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref>

Gigantamax Blastoise is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of using the [[G-Max Move]] {{m|G-Max Cannonade}}.

===NPC appearances===
* [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team|Pokémon Mystery Dungeon]]: Blastoise is the leader of Team Hydro, a [[Rank (Mystery Dungeon)|Bronze Rank]] rescue team. It joins a new team designed to rescue [[Team A.C.T.]] from [[Magma Cavern]] but fails to reach them. Blastoise appears to go exploring a lot as it discovers [[Western Cave]] and [[Meteor Cave]]. It reaches the end of Western Cave with {{p|Charizard}} of Team A.C.T., but both are defeated by {{p|Mewtwo}}. Blastoise is quick to anger, a feature that Charizard exploits to boost morale.

===Main series===
[[File:Gary Blastoise.png|thumb|250px|Blastoise in {{aniseries|JN}}]]
[[File:Siebold Mega Blastoise.png|thumb|250px|[[Mega Evolution|Mega]] Blastoise in ''[[XYS01|Pokémon: Mega Evolution Special I]]'']]
====Major appearances====
=====[[Gary's Blastoise]]=====
{{Gary}} has a Blastoise that he received as a Squirtle from {{an|Professor Oak}}. It made its first appearance in ''[[EP269|The Ties That Bind]]'', during Gary's [[Silver Conference]] [[Full Battle]] against {{Ash}}.

=====[[Tierno's Blastoise]]=====
{{an|Tierno}} has a Blastoise that he received as a Squirtle from {{an|Professor Sycamore}}. He first appeared in ''[[XY090|Tag Team Battle Inspiration!]]'', having evolved from Wartortle.

=====Other=====
A Blastoise appeared in ''[[EP060|Beach Blank-Out Blastoise]]'', where it ruled over an island of Squirtle and Wartortle. It had a {{an|Jigglypuff}} stuck in one of its cannons, and Jigglypuff's {{m|Sing|song}} subsequently made everyone fall asleep.

A Blastoise [[nickname]]d Shellshocker appeared in ''[[M01|Mewtwo Strikes Back]]'' and its remake ''[[M22|Mewtwo Strikes Back—Evolution]]'', under the ownership of [[Neesha]]. It was taken away from her by one of Mewtwo's special [[Poké Ball]]s but was liberated by Ash along with the other confiscated Pokémon. Along with [[Ash's Charizard]] and [[Corey]]'s {{p|Venusaur}}, they were the only confiscated Pokémon not to be cloned and they had the same marks that Squirtletwo had, indicating that it was likely obtained by Mewtwo through different means than the ones used to clone. After being freed, it fought with {{OBP|Mewtwo|M01}}'s cloned Blastoise and lost. Neesha's Blastoise appeared in an alternate timeline of the main series that was introduced in ''[[M20|I Choose You!]]'', where it was seen battling Corey's Venusaur; it is unknown if it holds the same nickname in that timeline.

In ''[[EP085|Fit To Be Tide]]'', [[Cissy]] used her Blastoise to compete against Ash and his {{AP|Lapras}} in a Wave Race for the {{badge|Coral-Eye}}. Despite a well-fought race, Ash ultimately won by having Lapras use {{m|Ice Beam}} and riding on the ice. It reappeared in flashbacks of ''[[EP098|A Way Off Day Off]]'', ''[[EP111|Hello, Pummelo!]]'', and ''[[EP113|Viva Las Lapras]]''.

Multiple Blastoise appeared in ''[[EP106|The Pokémon Water War]]'', under the ownership of [[Captain Aidan]]. They worked alongside a team of [[Team Wartortle|Wartortle]] and {{p|Squirtle}} that were used to extinguish fires. The team of Blastoise reappeared in a flashback in ''[[EP147|The Fire-ing Squad!]]''.

A Blastoise appeared in ''[[EP194|Ring Masters]]'' as one of the Pokémon competing in [[Rikishii Town]]'s [[Sumo Conference]]. It went up against [[Raiden]]'s {{p|Feraligatr}} and lost despite its extreme strength, thus allowing Feraligatr to proceed to the finals.

In ''[[EP248|One Trick Phony!]]'', [[Jessie]] borrowed a Blastoise from the {{jo|Battle Park}} and used it against Ash and his {{AP|Pikachu}} in an elaborate plan to capture it.

In ''[[HS01|A Family That Battles Together Stays Together!]]'', [[Lola]]'s Blastoise rescued {{ka|Flint}}'s {{p|Golem}} after it had fallen into water. It reappeared in a fantasy in ''[[AG177|Grating Spaces!]]''.

In ''[[M07|Destiny Deoxys]]'', [[Sid]] used a Blastoise as his main battling Pokémon.

In ''[[AG092|Judgment Day!]]'', {{OBP|Jimmy|AG092}}'s Wartortle evolved into a Blastoise while it was still being captured by {{TRT}}. This allowed it to escape with its massive size.

In ''[[DP072|Pokémon Ranger and the Kidnapped Riolu! (Part 2)]]'', three Blastoise were captured by [[Kellyn]]'s [[Capture Styler]] so they could use {{m|Rain Dance}} in order to douse a forest fire that was caused by [[J's Salamence]].

In ''[[XYS01|Mega Evolution Special I]]'', [[Siebold]]'s Mega Blastoise battled [[Alain]] and his {{TP|Alain|Charizard}}. Blastoise was successful in defeating Charizard.

In ''[[SM027|A Glaring Rivalry!]]'', a {{tc|Sailor}}'s Blastoise battled {{an|Gladion}} and his {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Lycanroc|Midnight Form}} {{TP|Gladion|Lycanroc}} and was eventually defeated by {{m|Counter}}.

====Minor appearances====

A trophy of Mega Blastoise also exists in both versions of the game.
====Trophy information====
=====Blastoise=====
'''NA:''' ''On a hot summer day, it's great to cool off by playing in a sprinkler. Don't look to Blastoise as a replacement, though—those water jets on its back are extremely powerful and would send you flying. In fact, Blastoise itself is so huge so it doesn't get blown away when it fires. Speaking of fires, Blastoise is better than a fire truck at putting them out!''

'''PAL:''' ''Tempted to have a Blastoise hose the mud off your bike? Well, don't. The water jets from its rocket cannons might look perfect for that, but they'd just blast your bike into oblivion. In fact, the reason Blastoise grow so big and heavy is so they don't get blown away themselves. If your house is on fire, though, feel free to get a Blastoise to help!''
=====Mega Blastoise=====
'''NA''': ''Some species of Pokémon living in [[Kalos]] have the ability to Mega Evolve, and here's one! Mega Blastoise is a bit bigger than Blastoise, and instead of two cannons on its shell, it has one huge cannon. This may seem like a downgrade, but wait–there are two on its arms! This math is easy: three is better than two.''

'''PAL''': ''Some species of Pokémon living in Kalos have the ability to Mega Evolve, and here's one! Mega Blastoise is a bit bigger than Blastoise, and instead of two cannons on its shell, it has one huge cannon. This may seem like a downgrade, but wait - there are two on its arms, too! Basic arithmetic: three is better than two.''

==Trivia==
* Blastoise shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Kabuto}} and {{p|Kabutops}}. They are all known as the Shellfish Pokémon.
** Despite this, Blastoise is based on a turtle not a shellfish. This may be due to the fact the Japanese category is more accurately translated "Shell" not "Shellfish".
* [[List of unused Pokémon and character designs|Early concept art]] for a Pokémon called "Karabajio" resembles Blastoise without its signature water cannons. The name may be a combination of "''carapace''" and ''{{wp|Caravaggio}}''.
* [[Mega Evolution|Mega]] Blastoise is the only Mega-Evolved [[first partner Pokémon]] that does not have two types.
* The way Blastoise flies in [[New Pokémon Snap]] is a potential reference to {{wp|Gamera}}.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9-20DgZlJQ i didn't know Blastoise can do this... OH SH--]</ref> [[Pokkén Tournament DX]] and [[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet]] have also introduced similar motions for Blastoise's actions.
* Blastoise was originally considered for [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]] alongside {{OBP|Charizard|Super Smash Bros.}} and {{OBP|Ivysaur|Super Smash Bros.}}, but director [[Masahiro Sakurai]] decided to go with {{OBP|Squirtle|Super Smash Bros.}} instead for evolutionary stage balance.<ref>[http://sourcegaming.info/2016/04/29/duflupdate/ The Definitive List of Unused Fighters in Smash]</ref>

===Origin===
Blastoise's design appears to be a {{wp|turtle}} mixed with aspects of a {{wp|tank}}.

Gigantamax Blastoise's shell may be based on a {{wp|battleship}}. It may also be based on {{wp|Leonardo da Vinci}}'s design for an {{wp|Leonardo's fighting vehicle|armored fighting vehicle}}, which itself is inspired by a turtle's shell.

====Name origin====
Blastoise may be a combination of ''blast'' (referring to its cannons) and ''{{wp|tortoise}}''.

Kamex may be a combination of 亀 ''kame'' (tortoise, turtle) and マックス ''makkusu'' (max; maximum).
