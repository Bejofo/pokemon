'''Eternatus''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ムゲンダイナ''' ''Mugendina'') is a dual-type {{2t|Poison|Dragon}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation VIII]].

While it is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon, the player battles a powered-up [[#Form data|form]] of Eternatus known as '''[[Eternamax]] Eternatus''' in the climax of {{g|Sword and Shield}}. Prior to [[Generation IX]], this form could also briefly be seen when it uses its [[signature move]], {{m|Eternabeam}}, but the form itself cannot be acquired legitimately in-game.

It is associated with the [[legendary heroes]] and was responsible for the [[Darkest Day]].

==Biology==
[[File:Eternatus Galar particles.png|thumb|left|250px|Eternatus absorbing [[Galar particle]]s]]
Eternatus is a gigantic, draconic alien {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. Its body has a vaguely draconic shape and skeletal appearance, and it is largely dark violet with red highlights. Its main body and tail are long and thin and resemble a spinal column, and it has four small, thin limbs ending in claws formed from spindly appendages attached at right angles. Its torso is formed from a cage of appendages resembling ribs, and inside is a glowing pink core that serves as Eternatus's energy source, absorbing energy to sustain it. Its head is triangular and has a pair of white, eye-like markings in the form of three connected circles, as well as a spindly lower jaw with several diamond-shaped teeth. Over its head is a translucent red film held between five long spikes extending toward its body's rear. It also has a pair of thin tendrils extending from its back, formed from numerous triangular segments. Eternatus's gigantic size makes it the [[List of Pokémon by height|tallest known]] Pokémon with the exception of Dynamax and Gigantamax Pokémon.

Eternatus serves as the source of the [[Dynamax]] phenomenon in [[Galar]] due to its power leaking out in the form of [[Galar particle]]s following its defeat 3000 years ago by {{p|Zacian}}, {{p|Zamazenta}}, and [[First kings of Galar|two human youths]]. After it reawakened in the present day, Eternatus's core needed to reabsorb the Galar particles in order to remain active, apparently due to its past defeat weakening it. In [[Pokémon Masters EX]], Eternatus can replace Galar particles by absorbing {{DL|Sync stone|sync stone energy}} in massive amounts instead. Its core can also project its absorbed energy into {{m|Dynamax Cannon|massive blasts}} fired directly from its center. These blasts are capable of causing more damage to Dynamax and Gigantamax Pokémon. Pieces of its body imbued with its power rain down throughout Galar in the form of [[Wishing Piece]]s and [[Wishing Star]]s. When it is awake, Eternatus causes a phenomenon dubbed the [[Darkest Day]], in which the massive quantities of Dynamax energy it unleashes cause Pokémon to Dynamax and rampage uncontrollably. It can also sometimes keep other Pokémon from Dynamaxing in its presence. Despite this connection to the phenomenon, it cannot Dynamax itself, as its Eternamax form replaces that effect.

As depicted in the {{aniseries|JN}} episode ''[[JN044|Sword and Shield: "From Here to Eternatus!"]]'', Eternatus can use its energy core to target a Pokémon and force it to Dynamax or Gigantamax. The series also elaborates upon its ability to block other Pokémon from Dynamaxing, depicting this power as Eternatus absorbing the Galar particles in the area to make them unavailable for other Pokémon to use. The same episode also shows that Eternatus can forcibly revert other Pokémon that have already Dynamaxed or Gigantamaxed through the same process. In the animated series, [[Rose]] coined Eternatus's name, but in the past, it was known as the "Darkest Day", as referred to by the people of Galar who feared it 3000 years ago. As seen in chapter ''[[PASS30|Oh My!! The Disappearance of Henry]]'' of the [[Pokémon Adventures]] {{pkmn|manga}}, Eternatus's poison has the capability of altering people's behavior, making them violent and selfish, as shown with {{Henry}} after he touched the poison. As later mentioned by {{ga|Calyrex}} in ''[[PASS38|Munch Munch!! The Mysterious Carrot]]'', both met during the first Darkest Day.

Eternatus is an [[extraterrestrial Pokémon]] that came to the [[Pokémon world]] inside an asteroid around 20,000 years ago. It's implied by [[Peonia]] that Eternatus's asteroid (referred to as a massive [[Wishing Star]]) landed at the [[Crown Tundra]], specifically in [[Slippery Slope]], creating a cavern now known as the [[Max Lair]].

Eternatus is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the moves {{m|Dynamax Cannon}} and {{m|Eternabeam}}.

===Forms===
Eternatus can power up and become [[Eternamax]] Eternatus.
[[File:Eternamax Eternatus Rose Tower SWSH.png|right|thumb|<!-- This is an APNG, do not edit the size or it won't animate-->Eternamax Eternatus uncurling its body [[Tower summit|atop]] [[Hammerlocke Stadium]]]]
When Eternatus absorbs all the energy in the Galar region, it transforms into its Eternamax form. Eternamax Eternatus is Eternatus's original form. This form's larger size makes it the tallest known Pokémon in existence. Its sheer size dwarfs even [[Gigantamax]] Pokémon. Eternatus briefly assumes this form when using {{m|Eternabeam}}, one of its signature moves.

In this form, Eternatus's shape drastically changes. Its body becomes incredibly long and serpentine with most of its body forming a massive coil. Its entire body glows red, and at regular intervals across its length are black rings with spikes extending outward. Its back tendrils now curl around its main body. Its energy core rests at the center of the coil inside a cage of violet spikes. Eternatus's head takes on the form of a giant hand, with its "fingers" covered in black armor with spikes extending from the back of each segment. At the tip of each finger there's a mouth-like opening on its armor revealing pink insides. According to [[Casey Shield]], Eternatus's five fingers are actually heads.

In its Eternamax form, Eternatus's power grows so immense that it causes a great storm of Dynamax energy around it, ripping holes in spacetime amid the storm as it releases a virtually infinite amount of energy. In this form, Eternatus is capable of using its most {{m|Eternabeam|powerful attack}}, shooting a large beam from the white spot in its "palm" and several smaller ones from its "fingers" or from all over its immense body. Thanks to a mysterious power, Eternatus can prevent opposing Pokémon from using any moves as it stores its energy. This power however can be countered by both {{p|Zacian}} and {{p|Zamazenta}} in their Crowned forms.

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
{{spoilers}}
* [[Pokémon Sword and Shield]]: [[Tower summit#Trainers|Eternatus]] is a main character and a boss encounter in the games. It crashlanded 20,000 years ago in the [[Galar]] region within a [[Wishing Star|giant asteroid]]. Around 3,000 years ago, Eternatus awakened for the very first time and caused a catastrophic event known as the [[Darkest Day]], which caused Pokémon all over the region to [[Dynamax]] and go berserk. However, the [[legendary heroes]] {{p|Zacian}} and {{p|Zamazenta}} allied themselves with [[First kings of Galar|two youths]] and managed to take Eternatus down, forcing it back into its slumber.
** In the present day, [[Rose|Chairman Rose]] awakened Eternatus to use its infinite energy to save Galar from an energy crisis a thousand years into the future. [[Leon]] attempted to stop it but failed to catch the {{pkmn|category|Gigantic Pokémon}} and was defeated by it, leaving it up to the {{player}} and [[Hop]] to battle it. During the battle, Eternatus entered its [[Eternamax]] state, which only caused the situation to become more dire. Using the [[Rusted Sword]] and [[Rusted Shield]], the player and Hop summoned Zacian and Zamazenta to fight by their side and managed to defeat Eternatus. The player then catches it to prevent it from causing any further damage.

|}

===Form data===
During the climax of {{g|Sword and Shield}}, the {{player}} confronts a powered-up version of Eternatus known as [[Eternamax]] Eternatus, which is fought in a semi-scripted [[Max Raid Battle]] and uses [[Max Move]]s like a [[Dynamax]]ed Pokémon.

This form is unobtainable, but briefly appears in the move animation for {{m|Eternabeam}}. The move is not treated as a form change internally, and Eternatus's stats and form index value remain unchanged. If  Eternatus uses this move, Eternamax Eternatus will not be registered in the player's [[Pokédex]], making it impossible to legitimately register {{Shiny}} Eternamax Eternatus. However, a Shiny Eternamax Eternatus can be registered in {{g|HOME}}'s Pokédex by depositing Shiny Eternatus into HOME's storage, as it automatically registers both forms. If a Pokémon targets Eternamax Eternatus with {{m|Transform}} or {{a|Imposter}}, it will instead transform into Eternatus's regular form.

Eternamax Eternatus's [[cry]] and [[base stats]] are different to those of its regular form (with it having the highest base stats of any Pokémon to date).

===Main series===
====Major appearances====
=====[[Leon's Eternatus]]=====
Eternatus debuted in ''[[JN012|Flash of the Titans!]]'', where it passed by the [[Galar]]-bound plane that {{Ash}} and [[Goh]] boarded, causing interference to it in the process. It later played a notable role during the [[Darkest Day]] arc, before being ultimately {{pkmn2|caught}} by Goh, who gave it to [[Professor Magnolia]] for safekeeping. In ''[[JN127|Just a Scone's Throw From Here!]]'', he entrusted Eternatus's ownership to {{an|Leon}}. During Ash and Leon's [[Masters Eight Tournament]] battle, Eternatus broke out of its confinement and flew to [[Wyndon]] to stabilize the immense energy created by the battle, before returning to the {{pkmn2|wild}} as Galar's protector.

====Minor appearances====

===Pokémon Adventures===
Eternatus debuted in ''[[PASS17|Stealth!! Infiltrate the Energy Plant]]'', where it was locked away within in [[Hammerlocke]]'s [[Energy Plant]] by [[Rose]]. It properly appears in ''[[PASS25|Rumble!! The Horrific Darkest Day]]'' when [[Rose]] started the [[Darkest Day]]. In ''[[PASS29|GRRR!! The Irrepairable Gears]]'', it entered its Eternamax form. After being attacked by {{p|Zacian}} and {{p|Zamazenta}}, it suddenly disappeared, only to reappear later and restart the Darkest Day. Once it had been beaten by Zacian and Zamazenta, {{Casey}} asked for it to be allowed to stay free to enable a potential coexistence between it and humans, which [[Oleana]] agreed to.

===Pokémon Journeys===
{{main|Leon's Eternatus}}
Eternatus debuted in ''[[JNM04|Flash of the Titans!]]''. It reappeared in ''[[JNM14|Sword and Shield... The Legends Awaken! (Part 2)]]'', where it was caught by [[Goh]], just like in the animated series.

==Trivia==
* Eternatus is the [[List of Pokémon with unique base stat totals|only Pokémon]] with a base stat total of 690.
* Eternatus, in both of its forms, is the [[List of Pokémon by height|tallest]] {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}.
* Eternatus is the [[List of Pokémon by weight|heaviest]] {{type|Poison}} and {{type|Dragon}} Pokémon, and also the heaviest Pokémon overall introduced in Generation VIII.
* Eternatus has several similarities to {{p|Terapagos}}. Both are [[Legendary Pokémon|Legendary]] {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that are responsible for the special type of transformation ([[Dynamax]]/[[Gigantamax]] and {{Tera}}stallization) found within their respective origin [[region]]s ([[Galar]] and [[Paldea]]). They also both have transformations exclusive to them related to these phenomena increasing their [[stat]]s (Eternatus's {{form|Eternatus|Eternamax}} form and Terapagos's {{form|Terapagos|Stellar Form}}, though the former is unobtainable) and can absorb the energy needed to use these transformations from other Pokémon, thereby rendering them unavailable. Both of them were also introduced in a game which would receive DLC and whose [[game mascot]]s comprise a {{DL|Groups of Legendary and Mythical Pokémon|Legendary duo}}.
* Eternatus, {{p|Zacian}}, and {{p|Zamazenta}} are the only Pokémon available in {{g|Sword and Shield}} that cannot [[Dynamax]].
** Pokémon {{m|transform}}ed into Zacian, Zamazenta, or Eternatus will also be unable to Dynamax.
** Despite this, Eternatus is still capable of using [[Max Move]]s in its Eternamax form. This makes it the only non-Dynamax Pokémon that can use Max Moves.
* Eternatus is the first Legendary Pokémon that can be {{pkmn2|caught}} with any Poké Ball without the chance of failing.
* Eternatus is the first Legendary Pokémon to be a {{Type|Poison}}.
* Eternamax Eternatus:
** Is tied with {{p|Blissey}} for the highest base {{stat|HP}} stat of all Pokémon.
** Has the highest base {{stat|Defense}} and {{stat|Special Defense}} stats of all Pokémon.
*** A [[level]] 100 Eternamax Eternatus could reach 655 in one of these stats, which would cause the stat to overflow to 0, due to a quirk in the coding for {{g|Sword and Shield}} which affects no other Pokémon.
** Has the highest base stat total of all Pokémon, with 1125. This also makes it the only Pokémon with a four-digit base stat total.
** It is the only alternate form of a Legendary Pokémon that cannot be obtained or used by the player.
* Eternatus and {{p|Regigigas}} have very similar category names in Japanese, with the only difference being in how they're written: Regigigas's category name is in {{wp|hiragana}} (きょだいポケモン), while Eternatus's category name is in {{wp|katakana}} (キョダイポケモン). In either case, the category name is pronounced the same: {{tt|''Kyodai Pokémon''|Gigantic Pokémon}}.
* Unlike other Pokémon in the {{pkmn|animated series}}, Eternatus is animated with 3D animation rather than 2D during the {{pkmn|Sword and Shield}} arc. It is the only Pokémon in ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' to have this distinction.
** Eternatus is the first Pokémon animated with either 2D or 3D animations outside of {{pkmn|movie}}s.
* In {{aniseries|JN}}, [[Rose|Chairman Rose]] is the one who named {{TP|Leon|Eternatus}}. It had previously shared its name with the [[Darkest Day]] event.
* Eternatus is the first Legendary Pokémon officially owned by a [[Goh|main character]] or a {{an|Leon|Champion}} in the animated series.
* In {{g|UNITE}}, if the language is set to Russian, Eternatus is referred to as both Итернатус ''Iternatus'' and Этернатус ''Eternatus'', while Pokémon GO and the Pokémon Trading Card Game Online only use the latter spelling.
* In {{aniseries|JN}}, Eternatus's voice effect was composed from effects of the kaiju {{wp|Gamera}} and {{wp|Ebirah}}.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSmbBE8yIrI ガメラとムゲンダイナの鳴き声 比較 / Gamera and Mugen Dyna's roar]</ref>
* When Eternatus was released in {{g|GO}}, its Pokédex entries are erroneously swapped between its normal and Eternamax forms. This was later corrected.
* In Pokémon GO, Eternatus uses the most {{GO|Candy}} to power up, with a minimum of {{candy|Eternatus}}60 for 1 [[power up]].

===Origin===
Eternatus's extraterrestrial nature and {{wp|dragon}}-like appearance may be inspired by {{wp|Uther Pendragon}}, {{wp|King Arthur}}'s father, who acquired his {{wp|epithet}} and started using dragons on his {{wp|Heraldic flag#Standard|standards}} after witnessing a dragon-shaped comet. Its abilities may also draw inspiration from {{wp|nuclear power}}, particularly its seemingly endless supply of energy which [[Rose]] attempted to use as a power source for [[Galar]] and which leaks out in the form of particles and is the source of the Dynamax phenomenon. In fiction, nuclear radiation is often used as a catalyst for granting superpowers or creating ''{{wp|kaiju}}''. It also vaguely resembles aliens from various pieces of media. This is also indicated by its association with wishing stars. Eternatus aesthetically seems to also be inspired by the concept of {{wp|diaphonization}}, the technique used to stain animal bones and cartilage. This being shown by Eternatus remotely resembling a skeleton. The most common dyes used for this process, alcian blue and alizarin red, could be analogous to Zacian and Zamazenta respectively.

Its overall body shape resembles the skeletal remains of a {{wp|European dragon}}, with the ribcage shaped like a cannon and the head resembling that of the common nawab or "dragonhead" caterpillar.

Eternamax Eternatus resembles a {{wp|hand}} crossed with a {{wp|Serpent symbolism|serpent}}. It may be based on the {{wp|Lernaean Hydra}}, a multi-headed serpentine monster from Greek mythology, known for its poisonous breath and blood, with Eternatus's "fingers" representing the Hydra's heads. It may also be based on the biblical {{wp|Serpents in the Bible|Seven Headed Dragon}} that, in the {{wp|Book of Revelation}}, throws one-third of all stars down to the Earth and is ultimately banished to Earth with the {{wp|Nephilim}}, the Hebrew giants — an event that ultimately leads to the {{wp|end time|end of time}}. This account may also be the origin of the item [[Wishing Star]] and the [[Darkest Day]]. It may also be inspired by {{wp|Shesha|Ananta Shesha}}, the king of Nagas in Hindu mythology who is usually portrayed as a giant, coiled serpent with a thousand heads capable of spewing venom and fire, though some depictions simplify his appearance down to five heads, again reflected in Eternatus's five "fingers". Shesha bears the deity {{wp|Vishnu}} on its coils, similar to how Eternamax Eternatus's core is mounted atop its coiled body.

====Name origin====
Eternatus may be derived from ''{{wp|Aether (mythology)|aether}}'', ''eternal'', ''eternity'', ''aeternatus'' (Latin for immortalized), and ''Thanatus'' (Latin transliteration of {{wp|Thanatos}}, the personification of death in Greek Mythology).

Mugendina may be a combination of 無限大な ''mugendaina'' (infinite), ダイマックス ''Daimax'' ([[Dynamax]]), and possibly ''dynamic''.
