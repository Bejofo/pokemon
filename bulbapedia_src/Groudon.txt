'''Groudon''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''グラードン''' ''Groudon'') is a {{type|Ground}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation III]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Groudon can undergo [[Primal Reversion]] and become '''Primal Groudon''' if it holds the [[Red Orb]].

Groudon possesses the ability to expand continents. In ancient times it came in conflict with {{p|Kyogre}}, a Pokémon with the ability to expand the oceans. In {{game3|Ruby and Sapphire|Pokémon Ruby|s}}, {{v2|Emerald}}, and {{pkmn|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|Omega Ruby}}, Groudon is sought after by [[Team Magma]] as a major part of their plot to create more habitats for land Pokémon by lowering the sea level.

Groudon is the [[game mascot]] of Pokémon Ruby and its [[remake]], Pokémon Omega Ruby, appearing on the boxart of both games in its normal and Primal forms respectively.

Along with {{p|Kyogre}} and {{p|Rayquaza}}, Groudon is one of the [[super-ancient Pokémon]].

==Biology==
[[File:Maxie Mindscape.png|thumb|left|200px|Groudon slumbering in [[Seafloor Cavern]]]]
Groudon is a massive, bipedal, {{wp|dinosaur}}-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} covered in red, segmented plates of thick, armor-like skin. It has a gray underside and large white spikes that run along the sides of its head, body, and tail. Groudon has four claws on each hand, four dozer-like blades on the end of its large tail, and three claws on each foot with gray markings under its feet. It also has blue stripes inside the seams of its armor plating which can only be seen when Groudon is glowing with power.

Groudon is believed to be the personification of the land itself, and is also described in mythology as the creator of the world's continents. It is immensely powerful, having control over {{m|Earth Power|the land's volcanoes}} and being capable of {{a|Drought|summoning intense sunlight}}. Groudon is capable of dispelling rain clouds with its light and evaporating water with this extreme heat. By summoning magma formations, Groudon can further expand the world's landmass. Groudon can additionally travel on water by using its magma to form a path beneath its feet. As Groudon slumbers in [[Seafloor Cavern]], it is encased in a layer of rock that will be shattered if it is awakened by the [[Red Orb|Red]] or [[Blue Orb]]. Groudon was hailed as a savior for evaporating flooded areas of the world.

Groudon is normally calm and helpful, but if it encounters its rival, {{p|Kyogre}}, Groudon will engage in a cataclysmic battle against it. This battle can only be stopped by the intervention of {{p|Rayquaza}}. Groudon is known to enter a deep slumber after this conflict with Kyogre. Groudon can attack its foes by {{m|Precipice Blades|manifesting the power of the land in fearsome blades of stone}}. It sleeps {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Rough-terrain Pokémon|underground}} in large magma chambers. Groudon loves [[Groudon Treat]]s made by [[Snacksworth]], who once encountered and waved to it in the past.

Groudon is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Precipice Blades}}. Prior to [[Generation V]], {{a|Drought}} was its [[signature Ability]].

===Forms===
Groudon can undergo [[Primal Reversion]] and become Primal Groudon.

Primal Groudon's appearance is similar to Groudon, but larger in size. Its skin color changes from dark red to deep crimson with its underside, spikes, and teeth turning black. The blades on its tail are more separated from one another. The {{tt|Ω|Omega}} symbol is now shown on its arms. Its eyes, the inside of its mouth, and the now-enlarged openings between its armor plating glow bright yellow, and its irises are now red.

The primal form of Groudon is said to be Groudon's true and original form and is at its full power when in the Primal state. Primal Groudon received its name from the ancient people of Hoenn who it tormented in the past.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150208024506/http://www.pokemonrubysapphire.com/en-us/pokemon/legendary-pokemon/primal-groudon-and-primal-kyogre | Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre | Official Site | Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire]</ref> In the [[XY048|Mega Evolution Pokédex Short]], Primal Groudon is said to create new land with every step it takes. The energy that fills Primal Groudon pours forth as magma, and it burns with such an extreme temperature that its body is always shimmering with the haze of its heat.<ref name="Primal">https://web.archive.org/web/20150202062720/http://www.pokemonrubysapphire.com/en-us/pokemon/legendary-pokemon/primal-groudon</ref> It uses this enhanced magma to expand the landmass of the world. With its weather-manipulating powers, {{a|Desolate Land|it can nullify}} {{type|Water}} [[move]]s. 

Primal Groudon was formed from the natural primal energy that existed in [[Hoenn]]'s ancient past. It has to feed on that same energy so it can maintain its primal form in the present day, after it was undone in the past by [[Mega Evolution|Mega]] Rayquaza. Due to the lack of Primal energy in the surface, it is forced to find either a source underground, such as the stones in the [[Cave of Origin]], or the Red Orb, allowing it to undergo a [[Primal Reversion]]. Primal Groudon along with Primal Kyogre have the power to disrupt the planet's balance, with the risk of it being destroyed.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150209222143/http://www.pokemonrubysapphire.com/en-us/pokemon/legendary-pokemon/the-legends-of-hoenn-continue | The Legends of Hoenn Continue]</ref>

Primal Groudon is the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] with {{a|Desolate Land}} as its [[Ability]].

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
* {{g|Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire}}: Groudon is the focus of the second Bonus Field on the [[Ruby Field]]. Groudon will throw rocks down from the ceiling to add obstacles to the field and create an {{m|eruption}} to surround itself in pillars of fire. The rocks take three hits to break while the fire pillars take four hits to break. During this time, Groudon will also throw fireballs at the Poké Ball to stall it further. The eruption does break any rocks still on the field. Groudon must be hit 15 times in three minutes to win. After beating the round twice, Groudon will be captured.
*{{g|Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team}}: When the player completes the [[Mt. Freeze]] dungeon for the first time, after {{p|Ninetales}} is spoken to, an earthquake will happen. Ninetales says that Groudon has awakened, and will wreak havoc. [[Team A.C.T.]] will go off and try to stop Groudon, only to be defeated, so a new team, made up of {{p|Blastoise}}, {{p|Golem}}, and {{p|Octillery}}, is assembled. When they get defeated, the player's team has to go to [[Magma Cavern]] themselves and defeat Groudon.
* {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}}: When the player visits [[Steam Cave]] for the first time, {{p|Uxie}} creates a fake Groudon, hoping that it would keep the player's team away from knowing Fogbound Lake's existence in order to protect the [[Time Gear]] it has been guarding. After the credits, a real Groudon appears in [[Shimmer Desert]] as the guardian of the [[Seven Treasures|Terra Cymbal]].

===Form data===
====Primal Groudon====
Primal Groudon is an additional form for Groudon that is the result of undergoing [[Primal Reversion]]. If Groudon is sent into battle while holding a [[Red Orb]], it will change into Primal Groudon; it only loses its form when the battle ends.

Primal Groudon is only available in [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|Pokémon Omega Ruby, Alpha Sapphire]], [[Pokémon Sun and Moon|Sun, Moon]], [[Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon]]. It was removed in [[Generation VIII]] along with [[Mega Evolution]].

In [[Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon]], Primal Groudon is not available to the player, with the form only being used in the fight against it. In [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX]], it is accessed by using [[Empowerment Seed]] on Groudon inside a dungeon.

===Main series===
====Major appearances====
=====[[Meta Groudon]]=====
In ''[[M06|Jirachi: Wish Maker]]'', a former [[Team Magma]] scientist named [[Butler]], working as a magician at the [[Millennium Festival]], wished to use {{OBP|Jirachi|M06}} to bring forth a Groudon. However, what he ended up with was not a Groudon, but a manifestation of pure evil that simply had the appearance of a Groudon. At the end, Jirachi used {{m|Doom Desire}} to destroy Meta Groudon.

====={{DL|Kyogre and Groudon (Ruby and Sapphire series)|Groudon|Groudon (''Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire'')}}=====
Groudon made its physical animated series debut in ''[[AG097|Gaining Groudon]]''. [[Team Aqua]] had captured Groudon but did not have [[Blue Orb|the correct orb]] to control it, so they planned to make a trade with [[Team Magma]], who had captured Kyogre. The trade was about to be made when [[Archie]] decided to use Kyogre to destroy everyone, including his fellow henchmen. The {{pkmn|battle}} between Kyogre and Groudon occurred in ''[[AG098|The Scuffle of Legends]]''.

====={{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (XY series)|Groudon|Groudon (''Pokémon the Series: XY'')}}=====
In ''[[XYS02|Mega Evolution Special II]]'', a Groudon was awakened by the presence of the [[Giant Rock]]. In ''[[XYS03|Mega Evolution Special III]]'', it was shown in its [[Primal Reversion|primal state]], fighting with Primal {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (XY series)|Kyogre}} over the Giant Rock.

=====Other=====
In ''[[DP043|Malice In Wonderland!]]'', a Groudon showed up as an illusion created by a {{p|Mismagius}}.

In the beginning of ''[[M18|Hoopa and the Clash of Ages]]'', a Groudon was summoned by {{an|Hoopa}} to defeat it in the past. A Primal Groudon was later one of six [[Legendary Pokémon]] summoned and hypnotized by the shadow {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Hoopa|Hoopa Unbound}} as its reinforcements. It and its teammates engaged in a battle against the {{p|Latios}}, {{p|Latias}}, and {{Shiny}} {{p|Rayquaza}} summoned to protect the real Hoopa in [[Dahara City]]. Eventually, after the shadow Hoopa was sealed in a [[Prison Bottle]], the hypnosis on Primal Groudon and the other Legendary Pokémon was lifted, and Primal Groudon departed for its home.

====Minor appearances====
Groudon debuted in the opening sequence of ''[[M06|Jirachi: Wish Maker]]'', where it was seen rising out of the lava in a volcanic area while being monitored by [[Team Magma]].

A Groudon appeared in a fantasy in ''[[AG036|The Spheal of Approval]]''.

A Groudon appeared in a fantasy in ''[[AG083|Unfair Weather Friends]]''.

===Pokémon Generations===
[[File:Primal Groudon PG.png|thumb|left|250px|Primal Groudon in [[Pokémon Generations]]]]
In ''[[PG07|The Vision]]'', [[Courtney]] had a vision in which a Primal Groudon destroyed a chain of islands before attacking [[Maxie]] and [[Tabitha]]. While she was puzzled by the vision's meaning, this ultimately did not deter her from carrying on Team Magma's plans.

===GOTCHA!===
A Groudon briefly appeared as a silhouette in [[GOTCHA!]].

===Pokémon Evolutions===
[[File:Primal Groudon Evolutions.png|thumb|right|250px|Primal Groudon in [[Pokémon Evolutions]]]]
A [[Primal Reversion|Primal]] Groudon appeared in a fantasy in ''[[PE06|The Wish]]''. It was shown battling Primal {{p|Kyogre}} before being defeated by {{p|Rayquaza}} as [[Zinnia]] told the story of the [[Draconid people]] to {{ga|May}}.

===Pocket Monsters Platinum: Aim to Be Battle King!!===
Groudon appeared in [[PBK4]].

===Pokémon Adventures===
{{main|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)#Groudon|Groudon (Adventures)}}
Groudon's first appearance was in ''[[PS214|Assaulted by Pelipper I]]''. Awakening Groudon was the main mission of [[Team Magma]], so they could expand the land. Groudon was finally awakened when Team Magma and [[Team Aqua]] formed a temporary truce to be able to go underwater. [[Wallace]], [[Brawly]], and [[Roxanne]] tried to stop the Pokémon's advance but failed due to the interventions of [[Blaise]], [[Courtney]], and [[Tabitha]]. Eventually, it reaches its destination: [[Sootopolis City]], to battle {{p|Kyogre}}, which it did for days on end until {{adv|Ruby}}, with the aid of a reformed Courtney and his own, {{p|Rayquaza}}-controlling [[Norman|father]], managed to quell it. Afterwards, it cut its ties with Kyogre and went to resume its slumber at the bottom of [[Mt. Chimney]]. It is shown afterwards that this restored the volcanic activities that Team Aqua had earlier annulled. In the {{MangaArc|Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire}}, Blaise and {{adv|Amber}} tricked {{p|Hoopa}} into summoning Groudon and Kyogre from their resting places, with [[Maxie]] and [[Archie]] making them both undergo [[Primal Reversion]] so that they could help defend the planet from the [[Grand Meteor Delta|giant meteoroid]] that was due to impact it in several days.

A Primal Groudon appeared in a fantasy in ''[[PS601|Beedrill Prepares]]''.

* {{TFG|Next Quest}}: {{TFG ID|Next Quest|Groudon|3}}

==Other appearances==
[[File:Groudon SSBB.png|thumb|230px|Groudon in [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]]]
===[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]===
Groudon is obtainable as a {{i|Poké Ball}} Pokémon. It uses {{m|Overheat}} to immolate itself in a fiery aura, causing anyone (except the summoner) who comes into contact with it to be knocked back and receive damage, similar to the attack of {{p|Moltres}}, though it lasts longer. Due to its tremendous size, it takes up a lot of the stage, making its attack almost inescapable. However, Groudon's attack is significantly weaker than Moltres', as it deals less knockback and damage; making it very hard to directly KO an opponent until they reach a very high damage percentage.

====Trophy information====
''"A Continent Pokémon. In ancient times, it brought down droughts to save people who had suffered from floods. It is normally found in the profound depths of the earth, where it slumbers in magma. With a mighty roar, it uses {{m|Earthquake}} to mow down enemies. In battle, it summons sunlight to bathe the area. It once had an epic battle with {{p|Kyogre}}."''

===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for Wii U]]===
Groudon appears as a trophy.

====Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''Groudon is called the Continent Pokémon, and that's not just because it lives on them. Legend has it that Groudon actually created the continents. It has a rivalry with Kyogre, said to have created the oceans, and they apparently had an epic battle long ago. Perhaps our world was born from this great battle between land and sea.''

'''PAL''': ''Groudon is called the Continent Pokémon, and that's not just because it lives on them. Legend has it that Groudon actually created the continents. It has a rivalry with Kyogre, said to have created the oceans, and they apparently had an epic battle long ago. Perhaps it was this battle of land and sea that created the world as we know it.''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Both Groudon and Primal Groudon appear as {{sbw|Spirits (characters)|Spirits}}.

==Trivia==
[[File:Terrell.png|thumb|175px|[[Terrell]]'s Groudon costume]]
[[File:Groudon Beta.jpg|thumb|175px|Early Groudon design]]
* Groudon's {{stat|Attack}} and {{stat|Special Attack}}, and {{stat|Defense}} and {{stat|Special Defense}} stats are the reverse of Kyogre's.
* Prior to {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, Groudon has a catch rate of 5.
* Groudon is the only pure {{type|Ground}} Pokémon to not have an evolutionary relative.
* Groudon shares its {{pkmn|category}} name with {{p|Torterra}}. They are both known as the Continent Pokémon.
* Primal Groudon is the [[List of Pokémon by height|tallest]] {{type|Fire}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}.
* Primal Groudon is the [[List of Pokémon by weight|heaviest]] Ground-type and Fire-type Pokémon.
* Primal Groudon has the highest base {{stat|Attack}} stat and base stat total of all Ground-type and Fire-type Pokémon.
** It also has the highest base {{stat|Defense}} stat of all Fire-type Pokémon and the highest base {{stat|Special Attack}} stat of all {{type|Ground}} Pokémon.
* The [[Meta Groudon]] in ''[[M06|Jirachi: Wish Maker]]'' is [[Size discrepancies in the animated series|much taller]] than Groudon's game height of 11' 06", being as tall as the mountainous structures in [[Forina]]. When an actual Groudon later appeared in the animated series in ''[[AG097|Gaining Groudon]]'' and ''[[AG098|The Scuffle of Legends]]'', it was much closer to its correct size.
* On the DVD cover of ''Jirachi: Wish Maker'', a normal Groudon is depicted, despite the Groudon in the film not being an actual Groudon.
* In {{g|XD: Gale of Darkness}}, the character [[Chobin]] operates a [[Robo Groudon]] after the [[Michael|player]] defeats him for the third time.
* Although Groudon is gender unknown in the [[core series]] games, it is referred to as a male in {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}}'s story; it is still gender unknown for purposes of gameplay.
* A Groudon [[Pokémon cosplay|costume]] is worn by [[Terrell]] in {{g|Battle Revolution}}.
* In its early design, Groudon's eyes were shaped differently, with the positioning of the spikes on its body being slightly different. Its head details became much more elongated in the final version, and the super-ancient Pokémon's signature body patterns are not present.
* When Groudon is caught in {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, it will have the {{t|Fire}} [[Terastal phenomenon|Tera Type]].

===Origin===
Groudon may be modeled after the Earth's land and volcanoes and may be a personification of the land. Its conflict with Kyogre is similar to that of {{wp|Behemoth}} and {{wp|Leviathan}} of Hebrew legend, who at the end of time would start a battle that would kill them both. Like Groudon, Behemoth is associated with the land. However, while Behemoth is usually depicted as a {{wp|Phacochoerus|warthog}}/{{wp|hippopotamus}}-like creature, Groudon resembles a {{wp|Therapoda|therapod}} dinosaur, with spikes resembling various species of {{wp|Ankylosauria}}.

The patterns on Groudon and Primal Groudon's legs and arms appear similar to the last letter of Greek alphabet, {{wp|omega}}, which might signify the end of life, believed to happen with cataclysmic events such as volcano eruptions. It might also signify the opposition to {{p|Kyogre}}'s {{wp|alpha}}.

====Name origin====
Groudon may be a combination of ''ground'' and ''don'' (Spanish for lord) or ''-don'' (common suffix in dinosaur names derived from the Ancient Greek word for tooth). It may also involve 土 ''do'' (earth) or ドン ''don'' (onomatopoeia for booming or crashing sound).
