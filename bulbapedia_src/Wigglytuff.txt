'''Wigglytuff''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''プクリン''' ''Pukurin'') is a dual-type {{t|Normal}}/{{t|Fairy}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]]. Prior to [[Generation VI]], it was a pure Normal-type Pokémon.

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Jigglypuff}} when exposed to a [[Moon Stone]]. It is the final form of {{p|Igglybuff}}.

==Biology==
[[File:Harley Wigglytuff floating.png|thumb|left|220px|Wigglytuff floating]]
Wigglytuff is a {{wp|balloon}}-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with {{wp|rabbit|leporine}} features, a bean-shaped body and stubby arms and legs. A fluffy, curled tuft of fur on its head is described as perfectly heavenly. It has long, rabbit-like ears with black insides and a slightly lighter color at the tips. Its large, blue eyes are covered in tears that quickly wash away debris. It is covered in pink fur with a white belly. This fine layer of fur is so soft that those who touch it, including other Wigglytuff, will not want to stop. As a result, Wigglytuff is a highly sought-after Pokémon because of its bouncy body and fur. It sheds seasonally, and people gather the fur to spin into yarn. It is proud of its fine and delicate fur.

Its body is soft and rubbery, allowing it to inflate by inhaling. Wigglytuff can inflate itself up to 20 times larger, though it has no limits to how far it can inflate. While it is inflated, it can move by bouncing or floating. It competes with other Wigglytuff to see which can inflate itself the most. Should it be caught in a bad mood, Wigglytuff will inflate itself to an enormous size to scare away its opponent. Due to [[Evolution|evolving]] via [[Evolution stone]], Wigglytuff is rarely found in the wild. However, they can be found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|vivid green plains and grassy fields}}. As mentioned in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Wigglytuff is known to stroke its belly while sleeping, possibly to feel its soft fur<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref>.

===NPC appearances===
* [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team|Pokémon Mystery Dungeon]]: Wigglytuff sells [[Friend Area]]s in [[Pokémon Square]].
* {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}} and [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky|Explorers of Sky]]: {{mdc|Wigglytuff|2}} is the head of the main guild in Treasure Town. His personality tends to be erratic, but he cares about all his friends in the guild, especially his close partner {{p|Chatot}}. He also has a love (some would say obsession) of Perfect Apples, and is basically all he eats. He can often be seen bouncing one off his head during dinner. He is described as peculiar and weird in the game, although he is exceptionally strong, defeating the whole of {{mdc|Team Skull}} and {{p|Kabutops}} and the {{p|Omastar}} Brothers, as well as numerous others, with ease. Chatot warns not to annoy or disrespect Wigglytuff, as he is liable to explode with anger.

{{-}}

==Trivia==
* Wigglytuff and its pre-evolved forms share their {{pkmn|category}} name with {{p|Qwilfish}} and {{p|Drifloon}}. They are all known as the Balloon Pokémon.
* Wigglytuff has the highest base {{stat|HP}} stat of all {{type|Fairy}} Pokémon.
* In its earlier appearances, Wigglytuff's white stomach did not always extend above its mouth; however, it always does this in modern appearances.

===Origin===
Wigglytuff appears to be based on a {{wp|balloon}} due to its inflatable body. Its soft fur and singing ability may be based on {{wp|plush toy}}s that play music to help children fall asleep. Its round shape resembles a {{wp|powder puff}} or a {{wp|Profiterole|cream puff}}, and its pink color, rubbery skin, and ability to learn {{m|Bounce}} are similar to a {{wp|rubber ball}}. It may also be inspired by the mythical {{wp|moon rabbit}} due to its {{wp|rabbit}}-like ears, {{t|Fairy}} typing (which tends to be associated with the Moon), and the fact that it evolves from {{p|Jigglypuff}} using a [[Moon Stone]].

====Name origin====
Wigglytuff may be a combination of ''wiggly'' and ''tuft'' (a bunch of hair) or ''tough''.

Pukurin may be a combination of ぷくぷく ''pukupuku'' (cute and chubby), ぷりぷり ''puripuri'' (angrily or in a huff; referring to its personality), くりくり ''kurikuri'' (big and round), and プリン ''{{wp|Crème caramel|purin}}'' (pudding; referring to its soft body). It may also involve 風船 ''fūsen'' (balloon) and 膨れる ''fukureru'' (to become inflated).
