'''Clefable''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ピクシー''' ''Pixy'') is a {{type|Fairy}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]]. Prior to [[Generation VI]], it was a {{type|Normal}} Pokémon.

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Clefairy}} when exposed to a [[Moon Stone]]. It is the final form of {{p|Cleffa}}.

==Biology==
Clefable is a tall, pink {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a vaguely star-shaped body. It has long, pointed ears with dark brown tips and black, oval eyes with wrinkles on either side. A curled lock of fur hangs over its forehead, much like its long, tightly curled tail. On its back is a pair of dark pink wings; each wing has three points. Its hands have three fingers each, and its feet have two clawed toes and dark pink soles.

Clefable is a timid, [[nocturnal]] creature that flees when it senses people approaching and is one of the world's rarest Pokémon. Its sensitive ears can distinctly hear a pin drop from {{tt|half a mile|one kilometer}} to 1,100 yards away. Because of its acute hearing, it prefers to live in quiet, {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Mountain Pokémon|mountainous areas}} of which it is protective. It has also been seen at deserted lakes during a full moon. Using a bouncy gait, it can walk on water and sometimes appears to be flying using its small wings. In the ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' episode ''[[EP062|Clefairy Tales]]'', Clefable is depicted as an [[extraterrestrial Pokémon]]. According to one tradition, seeing a pair of Clefable ensures a happy marriage. Some scientists believe Clefable stares intently at the moon because it is homesick. There is also a legend to this, which tells of how it listens for the voices of its kind on the moon during clear and quiet nights. As mentioned in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Clefable is known to sleep in remote places during quiet, moonlit nights. It is theorized that Clefable is dreaming about its friends and distant homeland during its peaceful slumber<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref>.

Before [[Generation V]], Clefable and its pre-evolved forms were the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that could have {{a|Magic Guard}} as an [[Ability]].

===Evolution===
Clefable evolves from {{p|Clefairy}} and is the final form of {{p|Cleffa}}.

===Main series===
====Major appearances====
=====[[Lusamine's Clefable]]=====
A Clefable appeared in a fantasy in ''[[SM044|A Dream Encounter!]]'', under the ownership of {{an|Lusamine}}. In the fantasy, she evolved from a Clefairy. She later physically debuted in ''[[SM050|Faba's Revenge!]]'' and would go on to appear frequently throughout {{aniseries|SM}}, becoming the caretaker of the [[Ultra Guardians]] base.

=====Other=====
In ''[[EP006|Clefairy and the Moon Stone]]'', after the large group of Clefairy blasted {{TRT}} away with {{m|Metronome}}, particles of the giant Moon Stone landed on some of them, causing them to evolve into Clefable. This also marked the debut of the species.

Multiple Clefable appeared for another Mt. Moon Festival in ''[[AG134|A Real Cleffa-Hanger]]'' along with a group of Clefairy, where they were trying to find a missing {{p|Cleffa}}. They later helped send Team Rocket blasting off.

In ''[[JN120|Infinite Possibilities!]]'', a Clefable oversaw an Evolution ritual for a group of six Clefairy, who all eventually evolved into Clefable as well. The first Clefable turned out to be the evolved form of a Clefairy that [[Professor Cerise]] had befriended in his youth.

====Minor appearances====
In ''[[PK01|Pikachu's Vacation]]'', a Clefable was at the [[Pokémon Theme Park]].

In ''[[EP090|Stage Fight!]]'', a Clefable was in a [[Pokémon Showboat|stage show]] about "{{pkmn2|talking}}" Pokémon.

[[File:Lusamine Clefable Adventures.png|thumb|200px|Clefable in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===The Electric Tale of Pikachu===
{{OBP|Ash Ketchum|EToP|Ash}}, {{an|Professor Oak}}, and [[Bill]] befriended a group of {{p|Clefairy}} living on [[Mt. Moon]] in ''[[ET03|Clefairy Tale]]''.

===Pocket Monsters DP===
A Clefable appeared in [[PMDP16]].

===Pokémon Adventures===
{{main|Lusamine's Clefable}}
{{adv|Green}} had a Clefairy [[nickname]]d Clefy, which first appeared in ''[[PS032|A Little Kadabra'll Do It]]''. He later evolved into Clefable in ''[[PS033|The Winged Legends]]'' when {{adv|Red}} used his [[Moon Stone]] on him. Although he was used only once for distraction against [[Sabrina]] prior to evolving, his increased power allowed him to stall {{DL|Legendary birds (Adventures)|Thu-Fi-Zer}} for a short time with his {{m|Metronome}}. He has since been used as a main member of her team in Green's {{pkmn|battle}} against [[Lorelei]]. During the battle, he {{m|minimize}}d himself to retrieve her miniature ice sculptures, deliberately blowing off the arm part to let the Elite Four's guard down. He has seen no major appearances since, despite always being listed as a team member.

A Clefable appeared in ''[[PS179|The Last Battle XIII]]'' as one of the Pokémon sent to participate in the fight in [[Ilex Forest]].

===Pokémon Pocket Monsters===
{{main|Red's Clefairy}}
{{PPM|Red}}'s Clefairy can evolve into Clefable, although it has since devolved back to the Clefairy stage, as Pokémon can reverse the Evolution process. Clefairy first evolves into Clefable in ''[[PM023|Clefairy Evolves... At Last?!]]''.

[[Whitney]] has a Clefable, which is {{TP|Red|Clefairy}}'s childhood friend, as seen in ''[[PM084|Fierce Battle Between Clefairy and Clefable]]''.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Clefable (TCG)}}

==Other appearances==
===[[Pokémon UNITE]]===
[[File:UNITE Clefable.png|220px|thumb|Clefable in Pokémon UNITE]]
{{main|Clefable (UNITE)}}
Clefable is playable through obtaining a Unite License. It is a melee supporter that starts as Clefairy, which evolves into Clefable at level 4.
{{-}}

==Trivia==
* The [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|prototype name]] for Clefable was ''Ariala''. The {{pmin|Russia}}n [[dub]] of ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' used this name during the [[original series]].
* In the {{pmin|Poland|Polish}} dub of the episode ''[[EP006|Clefairy and the Moon Stone]]'', Clefable is called "Kliferyla".
* Clefable and its pre-evolved form [[List of categories by abundance|share]] their {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Snubbull}} and {{p|Granbull}}. They are all known as the Fairy Pokémon.
** The "Fairy Pokémon" category predates the introduction of the {{type|Fairy}} in [[Generation VI]]. From this generation onwards, the type and category of these four Pokémon share the same English name. However, this is not true in Japanese, where the type is フェアリータイプ ''Fairy-type'' and the category is ようせいポケモン ''Yōsei Pokémon''.

===Origin===
Clefable seems to be based on {{wp|fairy|fairies}} and {{wp|pixie}}s since it is a playful, magical, humanoid creature with wings. It may also be inspired by the concept of {{wp|extraterrestrial life}} due to its rumored celestial origins and vaguely {{wp|star}}-shaped body. It may also reference the mythical {{wp|Moon rabbit}} due to its large ears, various Moon related powers, and the fact that it evolves from Clefairy using a [[Moon Stone]].

====Name origin====
Clefable may be a combination of ''{{wp|clef}}'' (musical symbol) and ''{{wp|fable}}''.

Pixy may be derived from ''{{wp|pixie}}''.
