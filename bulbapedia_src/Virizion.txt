'''Virizion''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ビリジオン''' ''Virizion'') is a dual-type {{2t|Grass|Fighting}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation V]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any Pokémon.

Along with {{p|Cobalion}}, {{p|Terrakion}}, and {{p|Keldeo}}, Virizion is a member of the [[Swords of Justice]]. In the {{pkmn|movie}} ''[[M15|Kyurem VS. The Sword of Justice]]'', they are also associated with {{p|Kyurem}}.

The [[Paradox Pokémon]] {{p|Iron Leaves}} is said to be either a future relative of Virizion or a counterpart of it from a parallel timeline.

==Biology==
[[File:Virizion Sacred Sword Adventures.png|thumb|left|150px|Virizion creating a blade while using {{m|Sacred Sword}}]]
Virizion is a stag or {{wp|antelope}}-like, quadrupedal {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that is primarily green. On the sides of its head are long horns that end in dull, curled points. It has a pointed snout with a black blaze running from its nose to the back of its head. Its face, hind legs, and underside are white. There is a pinked-tipped leaf on each side of its neck, and leafy tufts on its shoulders. On its back, there are pointed tufts of fur forming a medium-long tail. Its lower legs resemble knee-high boots with pink highlights at the knees, and it has black hooves.

According to legend, Virizion, alongside the other [[Swords of Justice]] had challenged the [[human]]s in order to protect other Pokémon from losing their homes to humanity's expansion. During the battle, Virizion used its speed to shield the other Pokémon from sparks and embers. The three Swords distrust humans because of a war that resulted in a forest fire in [[Moor of Icirrus]]. Virizion attacks its opponents by first darting around them with whirlwind-like speed, before using its sharp, sword-like horns to swiftly cut them down. In ''[[M15|Kyurem VS. The Sword of Justice]]'', Virizion is depicted as the most intelligent member of the Swords of Justice. As seen in both [[Pokémon the Series]] and [[Pokémon Adventures]], it can create an {{m|Sacred Sword|energy blade}} out of its head. Virizion loves [[Virizion Treat]]s made by [[Snacksworth]], who once encountered and talked to it in the past. {{p|Iron Leaves}} shares a resemblance to Virizion and is believed to be a futuristic Virizion.

In [[Generation V]], {{m|Sacred Sword}} was its [[signature move]].{{left clear}}

===NPC appearances===
{{spoilers}}
* [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Gates to Infinity]]: {{mdc|Virizion|gti}} is a very popular Pokémon among the [[Post Town]] inhabitants, even though she has turned them all down at some point. The {{player}} first meets her after rescuing {{mdc|Dunsparce|gti}}. Dunsparce had gotten lost looking for a crystal to give to Virizion as a gift, because he wanted to be her friend. Virizion turns him down, saying she doesn't have friends. This hurts Dunsparce's feelings, causing him to run away. After rescuing Dunsparce again, she asks to join the team. The player's partner immediately accepts, much to {{mdc|Emolga|gti}}'s chagrin. Virizion proves to be a calm and collected addition to the team, rarely outwardly expressing her emotions, but she changes as more and more is revealed about her past with her last friend, {{mdc|Keldeo|gti}}. She later admits that she likes Emolga.

* Virizion's {{stat|Defense}} and {{stat|Special Defense}} stats are the reverse of {{p|Cobalion}}'s, while their other stats are identical.
* Virizion, Cobalion, and Terrakion were all designed by [[Takao Unno]].<ref name=ND204>''Nintendo Dream'' Vol. 204, April 2011 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110704155314/http://shellspider.blog101.fc2.com/blog-entry-502.html Shellspider's blog (Japanese)], [http://lavacutcontent.com/ken-sugimori-nintendo-dream-2/ Translation by Dr. Lava])</ref>

===Origin===
Virizion is based on the character of {{wp|Aramis}} from the novel ''{{wp|The Three Musketeers}}''.<ref name=ND204 /> Like Aramis, it is the best at swordplay. Aramis in the novels was also the most feminine, vain, and romantic — qualities that Virizion possesses relative to its comrades. The shape of its head overall resembles a {{wp|tricorne}} hat, commonly worn by Spanish and French musketeers in the 17th and 18th centuries. It physically resembles {{wp|antelope}}s, such as the {{wp|gerenuk}} or other species of {{wp|gazelle}}. It may also be based on a {{wp|Deer|stag}}. Like its comrades, its nose resembles that of a sheep or a goat.

Virizion's Grass typing may reference Aramis's real name of "René d'Herblay", which contains ''herb''.

====Name origin====
Virizion may be a combination of ''{{wp|viridian}}'' (a bluish-green color) or ''viridis'' (Latin for green) and ''champion''.

==In other languages==
{{Other languages|type=grass|type2=fighting
|ja=ビリジオン ''Virizion''|jameaning=From ''{{wp|viridian}}'' or ''{{tt|viridis|Latin for green}}'' and possibly ''champion''
