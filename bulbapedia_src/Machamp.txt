'''Machamp''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''カイリキー''' ''Kairiky'') is a {{type|Fighting}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Machoke}} when [[Trade Evolution|traded]] or when exposed to a [[Linking Cord]]. It is the final form of {{p|Machop}}.

(Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for more details.)

Machamp can [[Gigantamax]] into '''Gigantamax Machamp''' if it has the {{DL|Gigantamax|Gigantamax Factor}}.

==Biology==
[[File:Machamp Shove VII OD.png|200px|thumb|left|Machamp Shove]]
Machamp is a {{wp|humanoid}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with four well-muscled arms. It has bluish-gray skin, red eyes, and large, pale, yellow lips. On its head, there are three brown ridges right above its eyes. It has two arms on each side of its body: a pair located in the normal position, and another pair directly above that attaches on the top of the shoulders. It has black markings that resemble briefs<ref>[https://www.pokemon.jp/special/kairiky_gym/know/secret/#c04 ゴーリキーとカイリキーのパンツのヒミツ - カイリキーのヒミツ｜キレてる！カイリキーGYM｜ポケモンだいすきクラブ] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20151127120008/http://www.pokemon.jp/special/kairiky_gym/know/secret/#c04 archived])</ref> and wears a golden power-save belt that resembles a {{wp|championship belt}}. Its legs have considerable muscle tone, and its feet have two toes each.

Machamp are said to know every martial arts style in the world. It punches extremely quickly, throwing 500 punches a second. With only one hand, it can move a mountain. In [[Generation VII]], {{m|Strength}} was its signature move. Because of its four arms, it can hit from a multitude of angles and pin all of its foe's limbs down at once. Its arms also allow it to attack and defend simultaneously. The four arms react much faster than Machamp can think. However, it has poor dexterity, and cannot handle delicate work without its arms becoming tangled. The belt it wears restricts its muscle activity, but it can cause consequences if removed. Being the result of an [[Evolution]] via [[Trade|trading]], Machamp is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Mountain Pokémon|mountains}}. In [[Alola]], Machamp is used as a [[Poké Ride|Ride Pokémon]] called Machamp Shove, where Machamp carries humans on its arms while moving large rocks out fo the way. 

In [[Generation II]], {{m|Vital Throw}} was its [[signature move]].


===Forms===
Machamp has a [[Gigantamax]] form.

As Gigantamax Machamp, it swells to enormous proportions and acquires immeasurable strength. Due to [[Gigantamax]]ing, its arms are filled with Gigantamax energy, making its punches as hard as bomb blasts. Its bluish-gray skin becomes darker. The ridges on its head are also darker, with the middle ridge becoming longer. Its eyes become bright yellow. The neck extends with black markings. The four fists are now dark orange, with orange-yellow veins connecting to two orange spots on each arm. The belt extends with several more notches. The black markings now extend down the legs and stop above the ankles. Three red clouds circle around its waist.

Gigantamax Machamp is the only known Pokémon capable of using the [[G-Max Move]] {{m|G-Max Chi Strike}}.

==Trivia==
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Machamp was originally known as "Ju-Doh". This name is a corruption of ''judo'', a fighting style.
*Machamp could be seen as a counterpart to {{p|Alakazam}}. They are both the last stage of a three-part evolutionary line, they reach their final stage by [[Trade|trading]], level up at a Medium Slow rate, and they both have a 75% male gender ratio. Also, Machamp excels at the {{stat|Attack}} stat, while Alakazam excels at the {{Stat|Special Attack}} stat. Their evolutionary lines are also next to each other in the National Pokédex. Moreover, a girl in [[Oreburgh City]] will [[List of in-game trades#Diamond Pearl and Platinum|trade]] her Abra for a Machop. Additionally, their base friendship is the same at 70, and all Pokémon in both of their respective evolutionary lines are in the Human-Like Egg Group. Finally, while Machamp has a [[Gigantamax]] form, Alakazam has a [[Mega Evolution]].
** Machamp also can be seen as a counterpart to the {{p|Conkeldurr}} evolutionary line. Both of them are {{type|Fighting}} Pokémon whose Attack is their highest stat. They both have below average speed. They share the same base stat total. They both have same gender ratio, they both have three-evolutionary stages, and they both reach their respective final-evolutionary stage through trading.
** Besides Alakazam and Conkeldurr, Machamp can also be seen as a counterpart to {{p|Gengar}}. All four Pokémon can be obtained through [[trade Evolution]]. Gengar and Machamp are also capable of Gigantamaxing starting in [[Generation VIII]] and belong to two [[Gym Leader]]s in the [[Galar]] [[region]], depending on which game is played; Machamp belongs to [[Bea]] in [[Pokémon Sword and Shield|Pokémon Sword]], while Gengar belongs to [[Allister]] in Pokémon Shield.
* Machamp's Japanese name, ''Kairiky'', is similar to the Japanese name of the move {{m|Strength}}.
** Additionally, in Mandarin and Cantonese Chinese, Machamp shares its name with Strength; {{tt|怪力 ''Guàilì''|Monstrous Strength}} and {{tt|怪力 ''Gwaailihk''|Monstrous Strength}} respectively.

===Origin===
Machamp appears to be based on a {{wp|Bodybuilding|bodybuilder}} or {{wp|Wrestling|wrestler}}. Seeing as it has more than two arms and blue skin, Machamp might also be based on a Hindu god, perhaps {{wp|Shiva}} or {{wp|Vishnu}}. Its muscular design, head crests, and large lips could also be a reference to the ''[[wp:Kinnikuman|Kinnikuman]]'' series.

Gigantamax Machamp, appearance-wise, resembles the general depictions of the giants from the ''{{wp|Ultraman|Ultra}}'' series, especially with its eyes and head ornaments. These particular warriors are protectors of the universe and often could only be gigantic for a limited time (much like Dynamax as a whole).

====Name origin====
Machamp may be a combination of ''macho'' (manly; Spanish and Portuguese for male) and ''champ''.

Kairiky may be derived from 怪力 ''kairiki'' (superhuman strength), which is the name of its {{pkmn|category}} in Japanese.
