'''Articuno''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''フリーザー''' ''Freezer'') is a dual-type {{2t|Ice|Flying}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation I]].

In [[Galar]], Articuno has a dual-type {{2t|Psychic|Flying}} [[regional form]], introduced in [[The Crown Tundra]] expansion. Neither Kantonian Articuno nor Galarian Articuno are known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

Along with {{p|Zapdos}} and {{p|Moltres}}, it is one of the three [[legendary birds]] of [[Kanto]].

==Biology==
Articuno is a large {{wp|Aves|avian}}  {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with predominantly sky blue plumage and wings said to be made of ice. On its forehead is a crest that consists of three, darker blue rhombus-shaped feathers. It has circular red eyes, a short gray beak, and long, thin gray legs. Each foot has three forward-facing digits and one facing backward. On its chest is a mass of white, downy feathers. Its long, streamer-like tail is longer than its body and the same shade of blue as its crest. Its appearance is so beautiful that, as stated in [[An Illustrated Book of POCKET MONSTERS]], those who see it will die rooted to the spot.

Articuno has the power to control ice at will. In ''[[The Power of One]]'', its ice is said to have formed the ocean's cradle alongside {{p|Moltres}}'s fire, and it has some connection to the weather patterns of the [[Orange Islands]]. When Articuno flaps its wings, it can chill the moisture in the air around it, making snow fall. It flies from icy mountain to icy mountain. According to legend, it appears before doomed travelers lost in icy regions. As seen in ''[[EP189|Freeze Frame]]'', Articuno sometimes aids travelers and guides them to safety. Articuno lives in cold, {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Rare Pokémon|isolated locations}} such as snowy mountains filled with permafrost. It is also shown to be territorial in ''The Power of One'', immediately moving to conquer the territories of Moltres and {{p|Zapdos}} in their absences, and fighting among them thereafter. When fighting alongside them, however, their combined power can defeat {{p|Lugia}}. As seen in [[Pokémon Horizons: The Series|''Pokémon Horizons'']], like other [[Legendary Pokémon]], Articuno can be found in the Pokémon paradise [[Laqua]]. Articuno loves [[Articuno Treat]]s made by [[Snacksworth]], who once encountered and sang with it in the past.

{{pkmn2|Shadow}} Articuno is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Shadow Chill}}.

===Forms===
Articuno has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Galarian}} Articuno.
[[File:0144Articuno-Galar 2.png|left|thumb|200px|Galarian Articuno firing {{m|Freezing Glare|beams}} from its eyes]]

In [[Galar]], Articuno has a distinct appearance. Its main body has lavender coloration with a black marking covering its chest. Its feet are black with lavender talons. The three feathers of its crest, which are longer, fused, and folded to the back, have the same purple color as its beak and tail. Its eyes glow light blue, appear to be mostly closed, and are surrounded by a black, mask-like facial disc. When Articuno utilizes its psychic power, the entire mask glows the same color as its eyes, as do the white, feather-like blades of condensed psychic power at the edges of its wings.

{{rf|Galarian}} Articuno keeps itself airborne with its psychic power, almost never having to use its wings for this purpose. Instead, the blades on its wings can be used to slice through iron as easily as paper. Its eyes can fire {{m|Freezing Glare|beams of psychic energy}} that leave its opponents stuck in place as if frozen solid — this is what earns this Pokémon the name of its Kantonian counterpart. It also has the ability to create mirages of itself in order to fool its opponent and escape. Its elegant and refined movements belie a cold and callous personality. It is constantly migrating around the world, but can be found in the [[Crown Tundra]] once every few decades, congregating with the other birds at the [[Dyna Tree Hill|Dyna Tree]] to eat its fruits.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/expansionpass/pokemon/galarian-articuno/ Galarian Articuno | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref>

Galarian Articuno is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Freezing Glare}}.

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
* {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team}}: Articuno resides in [[Frosty Forest]] and challenges the player and partner when they trespass. Articuno then accuses the player and partner of causing the snow of the forest to melt. An {{p|Absol}} then appears and convinces Articuno to let the player and partner pass through.
* {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}}: Articuno is the guardian of the [[Seven Treasures|Icy Flute]].

===Pokédex entries===
In Japanese, the wording 「でんせつの れいとうポケモン」 (''Legendary Freezing Pokémon'') is found in the Pokédex entry from [[Pokémon Blue Version (Japanese)|Pokémon Blue]] and [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Versions|LeafGreen]]. This is a reference to Articuno's {{pkmn|category}} (English: Freeze Pokémon; Japanese: れいとうポケモン). However, in the English version of LeafGreen, this was changed to "legendary bird Pokémon" instead, which is an expression also found in several other Pokédex entries of the three [[legendary birds]].

[[File:Legendary Pokémon engravings EP002.png|thumb|250px|Engraving of Articuno (top right) in ''[[EP002|Pokémon Emergency!]]'']]
* {{rf|Galarian}} Articuno shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Liepard}}. They are both known as the Cruel Pokémon.
* In the [[EP002|second episode]] of ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'', there is an engraving on a wall in the Viridian City Pokémon Center that depicts the [[legendary birds]]. Ash mistakes the Articuno engraving as {{p|Ho-Oh}}. While the blue coloration of the stone indicates the {{t|Ice}} type, and the wings and crest feathers are those of Articuno, the multiple tail feathers look nothing like Articuno's tail, being more similar in appearance to those of Ho-Oh.
* In {{3v2|Red|Blue|Yellow}}, as well as {{2v2|FireRed|LeafGreen}}, there are binoculars in the [[gate]] separating [[Fuchsia City]] from {{rt|15|Kanto}}, through which Articuno can be seen flying toward the sea. It is still visible in the binoculars even if it is captured or defeated in the [[Seafoam Islands]].
* In the opening of ''[[EP188|Spring Fever]]'', {{Todd}} points out a tall mountain that is Articuno's home. This mountain is, on the outside, the same as [[Ice Island]], Articuno's home in ''[[M02|The Power of One]]''.
* In {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}}, Articuno is the only one in its trio that cannot be encountered unless the player enters an event password.
** Also, it is the only {{t|Ice}} Pokémon in [[List of Pokémon by IQ group|IQ group]] C.
* [[Kanto|Kantonian]] Articuno is the only Pokémon other than {{p|Poliwrath}} (Generation II only) and {{p|Smeargle}} that is able to learn {{m|Lock-On}} or {{m|Mind Reader}} and an [[One-hit knockout move|OHKO]] move, being able to learn Mind Reader and {{m|Sheer Cold}}. An Articuno using this combination can be fought in the [[Battle Subway]].
* Articuno's English name was suggested by Bill Giese, who assisted in the naming of many [[Generation I]] Pokémon.<ref name=MonsterKids />
* Articuno and the other two legendary birds had Australian beetle species [[List of references to Pokémon in science|named after them]]: ''Binburrum articuno'', ''Binburrum zapdos'', and ''Binburrum moltres''. The three species were first described in 2020, and were collectively named after the legendary birds to reflect their rarity.<ref>[https://twitter.com/YHsiaoBeetle/status/1345310387059625985 Tweet by Yun Hsiao (@YHsiaoBeetle)], posted Jan 2, 2021</ref><ref>Hsiao, Y. & Pollock, D.

===Origin===
Articuno seems to take inspiration from various mythical birds such as the Persian {{wp|Simurgh}}, {{wp|Huma bird|Huma}}, and {{wp|Roc (mythology)|Roc}}, or the Chinese {{wp|Fenghuang}}. Many of these rare birds were said to live on high mountain peaks and are symbols of good fortune. Tales of their benevolence might be the inspiration behind Articuno’s reputation for rescuing people. Anatomically, it is very similar to the {{wp|white-throated magpie-jay}}, and its streamer-like tail feathers are similar to the {{wp|resplendent quetzal}}.

As suggested by the Pokédex entries, the three legendary birds appear to be embodiments of {{wp|seasons}}, Articuno represents {{wp|winter}}, while {{p|Zapdos}} and {{p|Moltres}} represent {{wp|summer}} and {{wp|spring}}, respectively. {{wp|Autumn}} is however unrepresented.

Galarian Articuno’s facial feathers resemble a mask worn at a {{wp|masquerade ball}} as well as some form of protective eyewear such as glasses, goggles, or a visor. Its freezing glare might be a reference to the {{wp|Cockatrice}}, a mythical reptile/bird monster that could turn people to stone with its gaze. Its {{Shiny}} coloration is similar to Kantonian Articuno's regular coloration.

====Name origin====
Articuno is a combination of ''arctic'' and ''uno'' (Spanish for one, indicating that it is the first of the [[Kanto]] [[legendary birds]]).<ref name=MonsterKids>Dockery, Daniel (October 4, 2022). ''[[Monster Kids: How Pokémon Taught a Generation to Catch Them All]]''. Running Press. p. 33. ISBN 978-0762479504.</ref><ref>(2006). ''[[Pokémon Fan (US)|Pokémon Fan]]: 10th Anniversary News Booklet'', p. 9 ([https://archive.org/details/10-anni-book/ Archive])</ref>

Freezer is literally ''freezer'' (that which freezes).
