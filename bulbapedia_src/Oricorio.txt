* If [[Yellow Nectar]] is used on Oricorio, it will change into '''Pom-Pom Style''', where it becomes {{2t|Electric|Flying}}-type.
* If [[Pink Nectar]] is used on Oricorio, it will change into '''Pa'u Style''', where it becomes {{2t|Psychic|Flying}}-type.
* If [[Purple Nectar]] is used on Oricorio, it will change into '''Sensu Style''', where it becomes {{2t|Ghost|Flying}}-type.

==Biology==
Oricorio is an avian {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that can change between four markedly different forms. The form it takes depends on the kind of nectar it consumes. All forms have a light pink beak, thin legs, and dark eyes with white pupils. The feet have three toes in front and one in back, and the beak curves downward.

Oricorio is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Revelation Dance}}, which changes its type according to Oricorio's style. It is also the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Dancer}} as an [[Ability]].

===Forms===
;Baile Style
In its Baile Style, which resides on [[Ula'ula Island]] in [[Alola]] and in eastern [[Paldea]], Oricorio is covered in red feathers with two lines of black feathers across each of its wings and tail. Its plumage resembles a frilly {{wp|flamenco}} dress. On the back of its head is a white ball with thin, spiraled extensions on either side that resemble earrings. Its eyelids are purple, and it has a long tail. 

Baile Style Oricorio is very passionate and exudes power when it dances and can get fiercely angry if it is given the wrong orders. It throws off downy fluff when it dances that it can ignite to perform a fiery dance attack.<ref>[http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/oricorio-(baile-style)/ Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Oricorio (Baile Style)]</ref> Baile Style Oricorio is popular with the people of Paldea due to its dancing style matching their temperament nature.  

;Pom-Pom Style
In its Pom-Pom Style, residing on [[Melemele Island]] in Alola and in southern Paldea, Oricorio is primarily yellow. Most of its body is pale yellow with a line of longer feathers around its waist like a skirt. Its lower body and short stubby tail are covered with short, white feathers. Fluffy balls of darker yellow feathers cover the end of its wings like {{wp|pom-pom}}s, and similar, smaller puffs cover its ankles. In the center of its chest is a yellow, v-shaped marking, and there are fan-shaped markings on the sides of its eyes. The markings around its eyes are echoed by three large, pale yellow feathers on each side of its head, which are tipped with bright yellow. 

Pom-Pom Style Oricorio's dancing charges its feathers with static electricity. While charged, its feathers can be used to attack and unleash electric shocks. It will also use its dancing to cheer up people who are feeling glum, but will also use this as an opening to shock unsuspecting foes. In Paldea, Pom-Pom Style is popular with children due to its energetic, cheerful dance. However, it is hard to find in said region.

;Pa'u Style
In its Pa'u Style, residing on [[Akala Island]] in Alola and in the [[Terarium]]'s [[Coastal Biome]] in [[Unova]], Oricorio has pink feathers. Its main body is a dark pink, while most of its other feathers are varying shades of pink. A fan of three feathers tips each wing: two light pink with a whitish-pink one in the center. On the top of its head is an arrangement of feathers resembling a headdress: a ring of fluffy, light pink feathers with larger, paler feathers standing up from the center. There is a larger, similar group of feathers around its waist like a skirt. 

Pa'u Style Oricorio can be difficult to deal with due to its laid-back nature. It uses its dance to focus its mind and increase its psychic power. The dance is also said to be an offering of thanks to its [[Guardian deities|guardian deity]].<ref>[http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/oricorio-(pa'u-style)/ Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Oricorio (Pa'u Style)]</ref> It gets caught up in dancing that it sometimes ignores its Trainer's orders. In Paldea, Pau'u Style Oricorio is popular due to being used to maintain health. However, it is hard to find in said region. It is more commonly seen in the Terarium.

;Sensu Style
In its Sensu Style, residing on [[Poni Island]] in Alola and in southwest [[Kitakami]], Oricorio's feathers are mainly purple. The tips of its wings broaden into a fan shape, and it has a fan-shaped crest on top of its head. At the base of its crest are four feathers with light blue tips. There are two of these feathers on each side, resembling ornamental {{wp|hairsticks}}. On the side of each eye are small, light blue markings that resemble eyelashes. The edges of its wings, fans, head crest, and long tail all have a double border of pale purple with a light blue on the outer edge. Sensu Style Oricorio is a calm and collected Pokémon. 

Through its dance, it draws in nearby spirits and borrows their power to fight. Its dance reminds people who migrated from [[Kanto]] of their homeland.<ref>[http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/oricorio-(sensu-style)/ Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Oricorio (Sensu Style)]</ref> In Paldea, Sensu Style Oricorio is popular with adults due to its elegant, attractive dance. However, it is hard to find in said region. It is more commonly seen in Kitakami.

Hobbes's Oricorio reappeared in ''[[SM030|The Ol' Raise and Switch!]]'', where it was used in a battle against {{AP|Pikachu}}, who was under Lillie's command at the time; it ultimately lost.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Oricorio (TCG)}}
==Trivia==
* The color for each Oricorio form corresponds to the Hawaiian word from which the name of its home island is derived.
* When opening up [[Pokémon Refresh]], due to {{DL|List of glitches in Generation VII|Pokémon Refresh form cry glitch|a glitch}} pertaining to Pokémon with alternate [[form]]s, all four forms of Oricorio use Baile Style's cry.
* Oricorio shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{rf|Galarian}} {{p|Mr. Mime}}. They are both known as the Dancing Pokémon.
* Oricorio, {{p|Tynamo}}, {{p|Eelektrik}}, and {{p|Eelektross}} are the only Pokémon included in all three of {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}'s [[Pokédex]]es.

===Origin===
Oricorio may be inspired by {{wp|Hawaiian honeycreeper}}s, small {{wp|passerine}} birds native to {{wp|Hawaii}}. Hawaiian honeycreepers feed on the nectar of various plants, but each species favors a specific flower that its beak is adapted to. Its dancing may also derive from the {{wp|Courtship display|mating dances}} of some birds.

Its dancing styles are inspired by different forms of dance: the Baile Style refers to {{wp|flamenco}} (baile being a Spanish word for dance), the Pom-Pom Style refers to {{wp|cheerleading}} (its wings resembling pom-poms), the Pa'u Style refers to {{wp|hula}} (pāʻū being a Hawaiian word for skirt, especially ones that may be used in hula), and the Sensu Style refers to {{wp|Buyō|Japanese dance}} (扇子 ''sensu'' being the Japanese word for a folding fan as they are used in such dances, which Oricorio's wings in this form resemble) while also bearing a notable resemblance to a {{wp|geisha}}.

Oricorio may also be inspired by {{wp|Darwin's finches}}, which have different beak shapes depending on which food sources are available on their home islands in the Galapagos.

====Name origin====
Oricorio may be a combination of ''{{wp|Old World oriole|oriole}}'' and ''choreography''. It may also incorporate ''{{wp|oratorio}}''.

Odoridori may be a combination of 踊り ''odori'' (dance), 鳥 ''tori'' (bird), and 色とりどり ''irotoridori'' (varicolored).
