'''Marowak''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ガラガラ''' ''Garagara'') is a {{type|Ground}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Cubone}} starting at [[level]] 28.

In [[Alola]], Marowak has a dual-type {{2t|Fire|Ghost}} [[regional form]]. It evolves from Cubone when leveled up at [[Time|night]] starting at level 28. All Cubone in Alola evolve into this form regardless of their origin.

==Biology==
Marowak is a bipedal {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with light brown skin and a cream-colored underside. Two small claws, one on each hand, serve as its thumbs, and one large nail on each foot makes up its toes. It has a short tail with a small spike near the tip. Marowak's head is composed of the skull it once wore as a mask. It can no longer remove the skull, which has become part of its body. The skull has two pointed spikes on the back similar to ears and tiny nostrils on the tip of the snout. Marowak's triangular, brown eyes are also located in the skull. 

Marowak is well known for its ferocity with its bone club, which it is said to collect from a hidden graveyard. Despite its small size, Marowak's body is as {{a|Battle Armor|sturdy as armor}}. Upon [[Evolution]], Marowak has overcome the grief of its mother's passing. Now ferocious and violent, Marowak is an adept combatant that uses the bone it carries as a weapon and a boomerang. Having evolved, it seeks vengeance on its natural enemy {{p|Mandibuzz}}, which prey on Cubone because of its naturally weak and timid demeanor. Marowak has also been recorded pounding on boulders with the bone club it carries to tap out messages to others. It lives in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Mountain Pokémon|mountains}} to test its skills. As mentioned in {{g|Sleep}}, Marowak is known to sleep while using its bone similar to a pillow, possibly being at peace.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref> On occasion, it is seen affectionately holding onto the bone while sleeping.

Marowak and its pre-evolved form, {{p|Cubone}}, are the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the moves {{m|Bone Club}} and {{m|Bonemerang}}. Marowak and Cubone are also the only known Pokémon capable of using the [[Thick Club]] item. In Generations {{gen|II}} and {{gen|III}}, {{m|Bone Rush}} was another one of their signature moves.

===Forms===
Marowak has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Alolan}} Marowak.

In the [[Alola]] [[region]], Marowak was faced with an abundance of its natural enemies, {{type|Grass}} Pokémon. This harsh environment led it to bond closely with its friends, which is said to have created a sort of sixth sense and caused it to take a new form. Alolan Marowak's body is black and it has pale gray eyes. There is a dark, flamelike mark on its skull between the eyes. Compared to regular Marowak's squatter, thicker body, Alolan Marowak is relatively thin. White markings resembling shoulder blades, vertebrae, and hip bones are visible on its back. The bone Alolan Marowak uses is longer than the one regular Marowak uses. It customarily mourns its companions by burying them and dancing in mourning.

Alolan Marowak rubs the bone it wields against its forehead to light the ends in a green flame and then twirls the flaming bone. The flame is made from spirit of its deceased mother. The deceased mother has transformed into vengeful spirit that will protect Alolan Marowak. It specializes in an attack where it releases a weak ball of flame from its bone that will relentlessly pursue its foe. Alolans would fear it for a conjurer, due to its rarity and the fearful sight of it dancing with its bone.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20171003202801mp_/http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/alolan-marowak/Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Alolan Marowak](Archived)</ref> The dance is also used as a way of mourning for its lost allies. Once its flames have spread onto an opponent, they are impossible to put out with water. The cursed flames are known to cause both mental and physical pain.

A special Alolan Marowak in [[Alola]] acts as the [[Totem Pokémon]] for [[Kiawe]]'s {{DL|Island challenge|trial}} in [[Wela Volcano Park]]. This Marowak possesses [[Z-Power]], an energy that originates from [[Ultra Wormhole]]s and takes the form of a golden, flaring aura. The reward for defeating Totem Marowak and completing the trial is a [[Firium Z]].

Alolan Marowak is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move {{m|Shadow Bone}}.

===Evolution===
Marowak evolves from {{p|Cubone}}.

In [[Alola]], Marowak has a [[regional form]] that evolves from Cubone.

* [[Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!]]: [[Marowak (ghost)|Marowak's ghost]] appears in the same capacity it did in previous iterations of the [[Generation I]] games, however, it is not battled. Instead, it is calmed by the presence of its son, Cubone.
* {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}}: Marowak runs a [[Marowak Dojo|training dojo]] the same way {{p|Makuhita}} had [[Makuhita Dojo|one]] in the [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team|first series]].

==Trivia==
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Marowak was originally known as "Guardia". This is the Spanish word for ''guardian''.
* According to some of Marowak's [[Generation II]] and {{gen|IV}} Pokédex entries, somewhere exists a legendary Marowak graveyard. This is a reference to the {{wp|elephants' graveyard}} of modern myth.
* {{rf|Alolan}} Marowak is the only dual-type Pokémon that shares no types with its pre-Evolution.
* Alolan Marowak is the only {{type|Ghost}} Pokémon in the {{egg3|Monster}}.
* Though Alolan Marowak shares the [[Ability]] {{a|Rock Head}} with Cubone, a Cubone with Rock Head cannot evolve into an Alolan Marowak with the same Ability, as Rock Head is Cubone's first Ability and Alolan Marowak's Hidden Ability.
* In the [[PO02|second episode]] of [[Pokémon Origins]], a mother Marowak is shown protecting her child Cubone from [[Team Rocket]]. Even though the Marowak is alive, the Cubone is still wearing a skull.

===Origin===
Marowak is reptilian in nature and may be loosely based on bipedal {{wp|dinosaur}}s. It also could be based on primitive cultures that wore bones for decoration and used them for weapons. The use of its bone {{m|Bonemerang|as a boomerang and as a weapon at the same time}} seems to be a reference to the {{wp|boomerang}}'s original use for hunting in {{wp|Indigenous Australians}} cultures.

Alolan Marowak's design may draw inspiration from a {{wp|fire performance|fire dancer}} holding a {{wp|fire staff}} or a {{wp|fire knife}}, a Samoan traditional dance implement. It may have also drawn inspiration from the Polynesian concept of {{wp|mana}}, a spiritual essence that exists in all objects and people. It also allows people to imbue their "spirit" into other people and objects for protection or vengeance. In addition, Alolan Marowak may have been inspired by {{wp|Nightmarchers}}, ghosts from {{wp|Hawaiian religion|Hawaiian mythology}} that march at night, are feared by the living, and traditionally are known for carrying torches as they march.

====Name origin====
Marowak may be a combination of ''{{wp|bone marrow}}'' and ''whack''.

Garagara may be derived from ガラガラ ''garagara'' (onomatopoeia for heavy clattering), contrasting with the カラカラ ''karakara'' (onomatopoeia for light clattering) in {{p|Cubone}}'s Japanese name.
