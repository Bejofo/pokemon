'''Jirachi''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ジラーチ''' ''Jirachi'') is a dual-type {{2t|Steel|Psychic}} [[Mythical Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation III]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

==Biology==
[[File:Jirachi true eye Masters EX.png|thumb|left|200px|Jirachi's true eye in {{g|Masters EX}}]]
Jirachi is a small, white, humanoid {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. It has short, stubby legs and comparatively longer arms. There are flaps on the underside of its arms, which give the impression of long sleeves. On its belly is a curved seam, which conceals a third, yellow eye with a cyan pupil, known as its "true eye". Additionally, Jirachi has a normal pair of ovalish eyes on its face, with small, blue triangular markings underneath. On its head is a large, yellow structure with three points extending outward: one from the top and one on either side. On each point is a teal tag, known as a "wish tag". A rounded extension hangs from either side of the yellow structure, framing Jirachi's face. Two yellow streamers flow from Jirachi's back, resembling comet tails.

Jirachi hibernates for most of its life, awakening for seven days every thousand years. It can be also awakened if sung to by a voice of purity. While it sleeps, a tough, crystalline shell envelops its body to protect itself. However, as seen in [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series|Pokémon Mystery Dungeon]], it can still fight while asleep. During the short periods it is awake in, Jirachi will grant wishes. However, how its wish powers work differ between [[canon|canons]]. In the ''[[M06|Jirachi: Wish Maker]]'' movie, {{OBP|Jirachi|M06}} cannot create objects through its wishes, instead, it'll teleport the wished object to the one who wished for it. By contrast, in the {{aniseries|BW}} episode ''[[BW132|Searching for a Wish!]]'', it can grant wishes without the use of teleportation. In the [[Pokémon Adventures]] manga, {{Adv|Jirachi}} will only grant wishes when its true eye is opened. Additionally, it can only grant three wishes every thousand years, which are written on each of its three wish tags. It was also shown being able to create artificial Pokémon through its wishes, animating a mass of seawater in the shape of a {{p|Kyogre}}. Jirachi's power is similarly exploited in the movie to create a [[Meta Groudon|monstrous Groudon]]. The movie further reveals that Jirachi's awakening is linked to the appearance of the [[Millennium Comet]] and that its third eye has the ability to absorb the energy Jirachi needs for hibernation. In Pokémon Adventures, Jirachi was shown to slumber in space. It is said that Jirachi's ability to grant wishes also gives it great attack power, as seen when it creates {{m|Doom Desire|a concentrated bundle of light}} to blast its target. Although it is extremely rare, Jirachi can be found in the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Mountain Pokémon|mountains}}.

Jirachi is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Doom Desire}}.

In {{g|GO}}, Jirachi can be obtained by completing the [[Special Research]], ''A Thousand-Year Slumber''.
When attempting to catch Jirachi in Pokémon Go, several Pokémon can be seen singing in the background. Jirachi is one of very few Pokémon, like Meloetta, with a unique catch environment in Pokémon Go.

===Main series===
====Major appearances====
=====[[Jirachi (M06)]]=====
Jirachi debuted in a major role in ''[[M06|Jirachi: Wish Maker]]''. It was revealed to only awaken during the week of the [[Millennium Comet]], where it would search for a partner to be its friend, with the honor in the movie going to [[Max]]. However, by the end of the movie, Jirachi went back to sleep, much to Max's sadness.

=====Other=====
Jirachi made its animated series debut in ''[[BW132|Searching for a Wish!]]''. A young girl named [[Gemma]] had been in pursuit of Jirachi, since she wanted it to grant her wish to restore her valley to the vibrant land it once was. Jirachi was initially shy towards her, but in the end, it warmed up to her and granted her wish before falling asleep again.

In ''[[PK26|Pikachu, What's This Key?]]'', a Jirachi was one of the Mythical Pokémon visited by {{AP|Pikachu}} and his friends, courtesy of {{p|Klefki}}'s keys.

====Minor appearances====
A Jirachi appeared in the opening sequence of ''[[M07|Destiny Deoxys]]''.

A Jirachi appeared in [[PK14]].

In the opening sequence of ''[[M10|The Rise of Darkrai]]'', a Jirachi was seen levitating over a {{p|Groudon}}.

A Jirachi appeared in the ending credits in ''[[PK24|Meloetta's Moonlight Serenade]]''.

A Jirachi appeared in a fantasy in ''[[JN032|Time After Time!]]''.

====Pokédex entries====
{{Animedexheader|Unova}}
{{Animedexbody|BW132|Jirachi|Ash's Pokédex|Jirachi, the Wish Pokémon. Reputed to have the power to grant wishes, Jirachi only awakens for seven days every thousand years.}}
{{Animedexfooter/Pokémon|Unova}}

===GOTCHA!===
A Jirachi briefly appeared as a silhouette in [[GOTCHA!]].

==In the manga==
[[File:Jirachi Adventures.png|thumb|250px|Jirachi in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===Movie adaptations===
{{main|Jirachi (M06)}}
Jirachi appeared in ''{{ma|Jirachi: Wish Maker}}'', where it fulfilled the same role as in the movie of the same name.

===Pocket Monsters DP===
A Jirachi appeared in [[PMDP29]].

===Pokémon Adventures===
{{main|Jirachi (Adventures)}}
Jirachi played a major role in the {{MangaArc|Emerald}}, first appearing in ''[[PS313|You Need to Chill Out, Regice]]''. Awakening for seven days at the {{gdis|Battle Frontier|III}}, it was sought after by the villainous [[Guile Hideout]] in order to fulfill his evil desires.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Jirachi (TCG)}}

==Other appearances==
===[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]===
[[File:Jirachi SSBB.png|220px|thumb|Jirachi in [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]]]
Jirachi appears as a rare {{i|Poké Ball}} Pokémon in its first appearance in the Super Smash Bros. series. The chance of it appearing is 1 in 493 (the amount of Pokémon in the [[Generation IV]] [[National Pokédex]]). Like the other "secret" Pokémon, it drops rare items before flying away. In Jirachi's case, the items are stickers.

====Trophy information====
''A Wish Pokémon. It's said to awaken for seven days once every thousand years, with the ability to grant any wish asked of it. It is truly a Pokémon of which dreams are made. In combat it uses its wish power to attack. Its attack, {{m|Doom Desire}}, which causes light to rain down from the heavens to do tremendous damage, is especially powerful. ''

===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for Wii U]]===
Jirachi appears as a trophy.

====Trophy information====
''Since Jirachi is only awake for seven days every one thousand years, it's an even bigger sleeper than Snorlax! It can't just be sleeping the whole time, though. It's probably hard at work deep in the land of dreams, strengthening its ability to grant people's wishes. If it detects danger while asleep, it can fight without even waking up!''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Jirachi appears as a {{sbw|Spirits (characters)|Spirit}}.

==Trivia==
* In the [[Pokémon Adventures]] manga, [[Team Aqua]] leader [[Archie]] uses Jirachi's power to create a Kyogre monster, whereas in the movie ''[[M06|Jirachi: Wish Maker]]'', former [[Team Magma]] member [[Butler]] uses Jirachi's power to create a [[Meta Groudon|Groudon monster]].
* Jirachi was the first Mythical Pokémon to have a [[signature move]].
* Jirachi was the first Pokémon to be distributed via [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]]. Previously, only the [[event item]]s needed to obtain {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} had been distributed via Wi-Fi.
* Jirachi is the only [[Generation III]] Pokémon that cannot be obtained in any of the [[Hoenn]]-based games without an event.
* Jirachi is the only pre-[[Generation IV]] {{pkmn2|Legendary}} or [[Mythical Pokémon]] that has [[List of Pokémon that do not appear in any regional Browser|not been featured]] in any of the Ranger games.
* Although Jirachi is gender unknown in the [[core series]] games, it is referred to as male in {{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}}.
* Jirachi was originally only available as {{Shiny}} in [[Generation III]] due to a set of bugs, wherein Jirachi obtained via [[Pokémon Channel]] or the North American version of the [[Pokémon Colosseum Bonus Disc]] were not intended by the developers to be obtainable as shiny, but were possible to obtain as shiny regardless.
** Despite being legitimately obtainable in Generation III, {{Shiny}} Jirachi were previously locked out of [[Generation VI]]'s Wi-Fi features prior to an update, and were also blocked from entering [[Pokémon Bank]] until after the [[List_of_Tanabata_event_Pokémon#2014|2014 Tanabata Shiny Jirachi]] event was released in [[Generation VI]]; this makes Jirachi the only Pokémon to have undergone this kind of issue.

===Origin===
{{Bulbanews|On the Origin of Species: Jirachi}}
Jirachi appears to be based on the concept of "wishing upon a star"—the practice of making a {{wp|wish}} while observing {{wp|meteor}}s in the night sky. Its pointed head is shaped like a literal {{wp|star}}, and its {{type|Steel}} may be a reference to {{wp|iron meteorite}}s. The tags of paper on its head resemble 短冊 ''tanzaku'', strips of paper on which wishes are written during the Japanese festival たなばた ''{{wp|Tanabata}}'', also known as the ''Star Festival''. The fact that it is awake for only 7 days may be a reference to how the festival always takes place on the 7th day of the 7th lunar month. Its thousand-year sleep followed by a short period of consciousness may be a reference to {{wp|comet}}s, most of which are visible from Earth only once in a lifetime, and the two long streamers attached to its body resemble a {{wp|comet tail}}.

Its humanoid appearance and ability to grant wishes may also be inspired by Arabic myths about the ''{{wp|jinn}}'', also known as ''genies''. In some folk tales such as {{wp|Aladdin}}, imprisoned genies would grant wishes to the person who released them. The eye on Jirachi's belly might be a reference to the {{wp|third eye}} which is believed to provide perception beyond ordinary sight fitting its {{type|Psychic}}.

====Name origin====
Jirachi may be derived from желать ''zhelatʹ'' (Russian for ''to wish''). It may also involve ''{{wp|jinn}}'' or 幸 ''sachi'' (Japanese for fortune).
