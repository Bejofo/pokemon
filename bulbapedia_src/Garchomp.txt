'''Garchomp''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese:]] '''ガブリアス''' ''Gaburias'') is a dual-type {{2t|Dragon|Ground}} [[pseudo-legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation IV]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Gabite}} starting at [[level]] 48. It is the final form of {{p|Gible}}.

Garchomp can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Garchomp''' using the [[Garchompite]].

==Biology==
[[File:Ash Garchomp.png|thumb|left|250px|Garchomp flying]]
Garchomp is a bipedal, draconian {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that is primarily dark blue in color. It has red on its underbelly from the lower jaw to the middle of the abdomen, including the undersides of its arms. A patch of gold comes to a point below the red on its belly, and a golden star shape adorns the tip of its snout. Garchomp has horn-like appendages that resemble a {{wp|jet}} or {{wp|plane}}'s engines, giving it an appearance similar to a {{wp|hammerhead shark}}. These horns allow it to sense its prey from a long distance. Its large mouth features razor-sharp teeth. The feet have three white talons, and each arm has a single large, white claw for a hand. Curved fins sprout from the arms, creating wings that allow Garchomp to fly. Garchomp also has a large dorsal fin and another on its tail that resembles a {{wp|shark}} {{wp|Caudal fin|tailfin}}. The male's dorsal fin has a notch on it. Pairs of small, white spikes protrude from its upper arms and legs, and there are gill-like slits on the sides of the neck. The eyes are intense, with black {{wp|sclera}}e and gold-colored irises.

Garchomp can {{tt|fly|although it cannot learn the move Fly}} at incredible speeds to catch its prey, and is capable of flying as fast as a jet. During flight, its wings generate blades of wind capable of cutting down trees. It is able to move at high speed in both the air and underground. It preys on bird Pokémon and is known to eat entire flocks of them whole. It sometimes battles {{p|Salamence}} in the air as they compete for food. After catching prey, it returns to its den before its body can cool down. The fine scales on its body reduce drag for easier flight, and their sharp edges also serve to {{a|Rough Skin|injure}} opponents who attack it directly. It can use its protuberances as sensors for finding distinct prey. Garchomp lives in volcanic and boreal mountain ranges, and typically dwells underground. However, it is seldom sighted in the wild. Garchomp is described as having a feral nature, requiring extreme caution if encountered.

In [[Generation IX]], Garchomp and its pre-evolved forms are the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Rough Skin}} as an [[Ability]].

===Forms===
Garchomp can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Garchomp.

When Garchomp Mega Evolves, several of its features become more angular, including its head and shoulders. A row of five tooth-like spikes sprouts from each side of its abdomen and red spikes grow from its knees. The claws and fins on its arms melt from the excessive Mega Evolution energy and morph together to form sharp, red blades. Because Garchomp takes great pride in its winglike fins, it is enraged at the sight of them melting into scythes. Its scythes can slice the ground to pieces, and Mega Garchomp viciously tears up its opponents with them.

==Trivia==
[[File:Early Garchomp FrontSprite Platinum.png|thumb|200px|Garchomp's prototype sprite from Platinum]]
[[File:Company Icon Mach Motors.png|thumb|150px|Icon of Mach Motors]]
* Garchomp was designed by [[Takao Unno]].<ref>Creator profile on Takao Unno in the [[Pokémon Trading Card Game Illustration Collection]], p. 182: "He has created the designs for Garchomp, Croagunk, Arceus and others." ([https://twitter.com/Lewchube/status/1581735619637948416 archive])</ref>
* Although the Garchomp in [[PokéPark Wii: Pikachu's Adventure]] and [[PokéPark 2: Wonders Beyond|its sequel]] has no notch on his fin, he is referred to as male.
* In an early Japanese trailer for {{game|Platinum}}, a [[Pokémon Platinum beta#Sprites|prototype front sprite]] is seen that is different from the final sprite.
* Garchomp is the only pseudo-legendary Pokémon to have [[List of Pokémon with gender differences|gender differences]].
* The company logo for [[Poké Job|Mach Motors]] depicts a stylized Garchomp head.

===Origin===
Garchomp appears to combine traits of dinosaurian {{wp|kaiju}}s, {{wp|wyvern}}s, {{wp|aircraft}}s, and different species of {{wp|shark}}s. It may also reference [https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandShark Land Sharks], a recurring creature in fantasy settings.

Garchomp also shares traits with various species of sharks, noticeably the {{wp|hammerhead shark}}. Its {{t|Ground}} typing might also be a reference to {{wp|Carcharhiniformes|ground sharks}} or {{wp|sand shark}}s. It may also be based on {{wp|Therapoda|theropod}} dinosaurs, particularly the ''{{wp|Carcharodontosaurus}}'', whose teeth are often compared to the great white shark's due to similar serrations and sharpness. 

Garchomp's aircraft traits may allude to {{wp|Curtiss P-40 Warhawk}} fighters. These models popularized shark-themed {{wp|nose art}}s on aircraft and were often referred to as "desert sharks".

Mega Garchomp's skull-like head and scythe arms may be based on traits of typical {{wp|Grim Reaper}} depictions.

====Name origin====
Garchomp may be a combination of its Japanese name, ''carcharias'' (Latinization of the Greek word for shark ''karkharías''), ''chomp'', and possibly ''gargantuan''.

Gaburias may be a combination of がぶり ''gaburi'' (with a big bite) and ''carcharias'' or アース ''āsu'' (earth).
