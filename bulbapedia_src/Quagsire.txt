'''Quagsire''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ヌオー''' ''Nuoh'') is a dual-type {{2t|Water|Ground}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation II]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Wooper}} starting at [[level]] 20.

==Biology==
Quagsire is a light blue, bipedal, {{wp|amphibian|amphibious}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. Its head is broad and round, having little neck to distinguish it from the rest of its body. It has a wide mouth and tiny, black eyes. A wavy, purple stripe runs down its back. Along its spine is a dark blue fin, which is larger on the male than on the female. Quagsire's hands and feet both have three digits. Its outer layer of skin is slimy and slippery. Quagsire shares many similarities with its [[Paldea]]n relative, {{p|Clodsire}}.

Quagsire is carefree and sluggish by nature, although it is protective towards {{p|Wooper}}. An unintelligent Pokémon, it tends to bump its head inadvertently while swimming and seems not to care. It hunts for food by leaving its mouth wide open in water and waiting for its unaware prey to blunder in. Because Quagsire does not move, it does not get very hungry and can afford to wait for its food. As shown in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Quagsire leaves its mouth open even as it sleeps. It is said seeing a Quagsire asleep with its mouth wide open is a sign it’s possbily waiting for prey, while it dreams. Quagsire lives in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Water's-edge Pokémon|clean bodies of freshwater}}, as well as muddy swamps. During the day, Quagsire avoids sunlight by submerging itself in the water.

In the ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' episode ''[[EP127|Once in a Blue Moon]]'', wild Quagsire are shown to have an annual celebration at [[Blue Moon Falls]] when the moon is full. There they attempt to shoot round objects they have collected to the top of a waterfall with their attacks, to see who can launch their objects the highest, with the apparent target being the moon.

===Evolution===
Quagsire evolves from {{p|Wooper}}.

===NPC appearances===
* {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Gates to Infinity}}: Quagsire appears as the landlord of [[Pokémon Paradise|Paradise]] as well as an important character in the storyline. The player's partner buys land from him at the beginning of the game that would become the headquarters for the player's exploration team. He also runs an area similar to the [[Chimecho Assembly]] from the previous games. Like some members of [[Wigglytuff's Guild]], he has a catchphrase, which is "hmm". He is also responsible for dealing with captured outlaws, much like {{p|Magnezone}} before him. He is known to be a hard taskmaster to these Pokémon. Quagsire reappears in {{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}} where he is now a resident of [[Lively Town]].

==Trivia==
* According to Julien Bardakoff, the French translator of the [[Generation I]] and [[Generation II]] games, its French name was supposed to be spelled and pronounced "Maraisté", with an acute accent on the final "e". However, mainly due to the lack of diacritics on uppercase letters in the French translations up to [[Generation V]], players and the animated series got misled and made this "e" a silent letter. As a consequence of this hegemonic usage, it has never been restored despite all diacritics being properly displayed in French for all concerned Pokémon since [[Pokémon Black and White Versions|Pokémon Black and White]]. The only known instance of a proper pronunciation as intended by Bardakoff is by the commentator in [[Pokémon Stadium 2]].

===Origin===
Quagsire appears to be based on a {{wp|giant salamander}}.

====Name origin====
Quagsire may be a combination of ''{{wp|Mire|quagmire}}'' and the honorific ''sire'' or ''{{wp|Siren (genus)|Siren}}'' (a genus of salamander).

Nuoh may be a combination of 沼 ''numa'' (swamp, marsh, pond, or lake) and 王 ''ō'' (king) or オオサンショウウオ ''ōsanshōuo'' ({{wp|Japanese giant salamander}}).
