'''Dialga''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ディアルガ''' ''Dialga'') is a dual-type {{2t|Steel|Dragon}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation IV]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Dialga transforms into a second [[#Form data|form]], called its '''Origin Forme''', while holding an [[Adamant Crystal]].

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Form data|Game data&rarr;Form data]] for these details.)

Dialga is the [[game mascot]] of {{game3|Diamond and Pearl|Pokémon Diamond|s}} and its [[remake]] {{pkmn|Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl|Pokémon Brilliant Diamond}}, appearing on the box art of both games in its standard form.

Along with {{p|Palkia}} and {{p|Giratina}}, it is one of the [[Pokémon of myth]], representing {{wp|time}}. In the past, it was worshipped by the [[Diamond Clan]] under the name '''almighty Sinnoh''' (Japanese: '''シンオウ{{ruby|様|さま}}''' ''Shin'ou-sama'').

==Biology==
[[File:Universal destruction BDSP.png|thumb|left|240px|Dialga destroying the {{pkmn|universe}}]]
Dialga is a dark-blue, {{wp|sauropod}}-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with some gray metallic portions and light blue stripes. It has a chest plate on its torso, which has a deep blue diamond-like crystal embedded in the center. Dialga has a five-spiked fin-like structure on its back similar to a gear, three spines on the back of its neck, and a crest on its head, resembling a dinosaur. The crest somewhat resembles the shape of a sundial's rod. It also has two structures on the sides of its head that extend outward and resemble horns and fangs. It has three claws on each foot, of the same metallic look as its chest plate. 

According to the [[Sinnoh myths|myths and legends]] of the [[Hisui]]/[[Sinnoh]] [[region]], in the beginning of existence, the [[Mythical Pokémon]] {{p|Arceus}} created {{Pkmn|egg|eggs}} in which the Pokémon of time–Dialga, the Pokémon of space–{{p|Palkia}}, and the Pokémon of antimatter–{{p|Giratina}}, hatched from, all three in their {{form|Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina|Origin Formes}}. After the [[Pokémon universe]] was created, Dialga retreated into its [[Dimension#Dialga's world|own dimension]], where it has lived since. It was revered and feared as a deity in the past, being worshipped by the [[Diamond Clan]], who mistook it for Arceus and referred to it as "almighty Sinnoh". Dialga is capable of [[Talking Pokémon|speaking human language]] via telepathy, as seen when it communicates through the leader of the Diamond Clan, [[Adaman]]. Dialga and Palkia may be also thrown into a frenzy by powerful [[Space-time distortion|space-time rifts]] created by Giratina. Both can also control and spread the [[space-time distortion]]s from Giratina's rift, which create [[alpha Pokémon]] and cause [[noble Pokémon]] to become frenzied through lightning bolts that come out of these distortions. 

Dialga has the power to control time: it can warp time by either speeding it up, slowing it down, reversing it, or stopping it altogether. It can also [[Time travel|travel through time]] to visit the past, present, and future. Additionally, it is capable of blasting its targets with {{m|Roar of Time|power that distorts time itself}}. It also has the power to destroy and create an entire universe, either by itself or with Palkia's aid. As shown in {{aniseries|JN}}, Dialga's temporal powers possess the ability to [[Devolution|devolve]] anything or anyone against their will, including {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}, [[Human|people]], and [[Flora of the Pokémon world|plant life]]. It can reverse these effects as well. It is said that time started moving when Dialga was born and will continue flowing as long as its heart beats. Dialga usually travels by levitating. Since Dialga primarily resides in a different dimension, its behavior is nearly impossible to study. In the dimension where Dialga lives in, time is said to be constantly moving in different directions and speeds.<ref>[https://legends.arceus.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon/dialga/ Dialga (Origin Forme) | Pokémon Legends: Arceus Official Website]</ref> In the anime, {{mov|Dialga|it}} has been shown to be very protective of its home, and as a result, tends to have violent conflicts with {{mov|Palkia}} when their dimensions intersect. The fin-like structure on its back is shaped radiating outwards and can be used to focus the flow of time, as seen in [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series|Pokémon Mystery Dungeon]]. 

Dialga is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Roar of Time}}.

===Forms===
[[File:Dialga Origin Forme mouth open.png|thumb|right|240px|Origin Dialga's plate mask opened]]
Dialga can change between its standard form and its Origin Forme.

Said to be the Pokémon's true form, Dialga's Origin Forme is drastically different from the usual sauropod-like look of its other forme, being a hybrid between it, a dragon, and a [[wikipedia:Centaur|centaur]], while also resembling its creator, {{p|Arceus}}. The back legs of Dialga become unguligrade in shape and have pointed tips instead of feet. The front legs are noticeably larger, with three distinct rhomboid claws on the underside. Further up, Dialga's knees have rectangular, long, and thin protrusions. Its chest plate is gone; however, it has a similar polygonal shape in its place. On Dialga's neck is a large shape jutting out towards the front (giving it the appearance of a larger throat), along with two pairs of protrusions on either side, the upper pair being larger and resembling panels or wings. Inside this large shape and wing-like protrusions are deep blue diamond-like crystals, embedded into diamond-shaped grooves. The three spines located on the back of the neck are longer and sharper. Dialga's head has two thin arrow-shaped horns extending towards the top and back of its head, along with longer fang-like horns connected to a plate mask covering its lower jaw, which can shift in angle to reveal the mouth. The plate mask also partly covers the arrow-shaped horns on their sides. Around Dialga's abdomen is a cross made of four arrow shapes attached to a small wheel, reminiscent of Arceus's cross-wheel. The fin-like plate on Dialga's posterior has a star-shaped layer on top of it. The tail is much shorter and crystal-shaped. Overall, Dialga's entire body becomes larger and nearly completely dark blue. The crest, arrow-shaped horns, knee protrusions, and abdomen cross are light blue, while the tips of Dialga's fin-like plate and feet are dark gray.

Dialga is at its full power when in its Origin Forme, and is supposedly permanently in this state while in its home dimension. Dialga's transformation into its Origin Forme is triggered by a radiant light; it can also be invoked using the [[Adamant Crystal]]. Origin Forme Dialga can unleash meteors and shockwaves, while its {{m|Roar of Time}} technique can be charged into a stronger version of itself as seen in its boss battle in {{g|Legends: Arceus}}. The crystals and light blue accents on Dialga's body glow brightly when it uses its powers.

;Primal Dialga
A unique {{pkmn2|variant}} of Dialga, called [[Primal Dialga]] resembles a normal Dialga with a darkened color. The main body is colored dark blue. The center diamond-like crystal is colored dark orange. The lines in its body are also orange.

Primal Dialga cannot control time due to it being tampered with. It acts much more aggressively than Dialga normally would. It can still use its time abilities to some extent. It can also prevent others from time traveling, even cancelling out {{p|Celebi}}'s time powers.

===Form data===
Along with the other [[Pokémon of myth]], Dialga has the ability to switch to a second form: Origin Forme.

The standard form of Dialga debuted in {{game|Diamond and Pearl|s}}, and its Origin Forme was introduced in {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, in which it changes between its standard form and Origin Forme when exposed to an [[Adamant Crystal]]. In {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, Dialga transforms into its Origin Forme while holding an Adamant Crystal. If it is deposited in {{g|HOME}}, it will revert to its standard form.

The forms differ in their [[base stats]]: Dialga's Origin Forme has decreased {{stat|Attack}} and increased {{stat|Special Defense}} compared to its standard form, though its base stat total is the same. In Pokémon Legends: Arceus, its [[signature move]], {{m|Roar of Time}}, has modified base [[power]] and {{stat|accuracy}} when used by its Origin Form, as well as a unique animation.

[[File:Dialga anime movie 12.png|thumb|250px|Dialga in ''[[M12|Arceus and the Jewel of Life]]'']]
===Main series===
====Major appearances====
=====[[Dialga (movie)]]=====
Dialga made its physical debut in ''[[M10|The Rise of Darkrai]]'', where it fought with {{mov|Palkia}} and {{OBP|Darkrai|M10}} in a {{pkmn|battle}} that nearly destroyed [[Alamos Town]]. It then briefly reappeared in ''[[M11|Giratina and the Sky Warrior]]''. During its trip back to its own dimension, Dialga ended up in the [[Reverse World]] and got attacked by {{mov|Giratina}}, who had been angered by Dialga and Palkia's fight in the previous movie.

In ''[[M12|Arceus and the Jewel of Life]]'', Dialga was shown for the first time with both the other two [[Pokémon of myth]]. After being called by [[Sheena]] to stop a spatial distortion, it briefly fought with Giratina once more. Later, it returned to help Palkia and Giratina fight {{OBP|Arceus|M12}}. After being injured, it sent Sheena, {{Ash}}, and {{ashfr}} [[Time travel|back in time]] to fix Arceus's betrayal.

=====Dialga (recurring)=====
A Dialga appeared in ''[[JN089|The Gates of Warp!]]'' and ''[[JN090|Showdown at the Gates of Warp!]]'', where it was a target of [[Alternate World Team Rocket]], along with {{OBP|Palkia|recurring}}. Using a [[Red Chain]], Alternate World Team Rocket forced the two [[Legendary Pokémon]] to fight, creating time distortions that caused Pokémon to start [[Devolution|devolving]] and eventually revert into {{pkmn|Egg}}s, which Team Rocket would then steal and raise to be their own. The battle was finally stopped when Ash, {{an|Dawn}}, [[Goh]], [[Chloe]], and their alternate world counterparts prayed for {{p|Arceus}} to do so. Freed from the Red Chain, Dialga and Palkia then undid all the devolutions their battle had caused.

=====Other=====
In ''[[DP152|The Battle Finale of Legend!]]'', Dialga and Palkia were summoned by [[Cyrus]] on the [[Spear Pillar]]. They were put under his control through the use of the Red Chain and were tasked by him to open a portal to another dimension, wanting a world of his own. After the Red Chain's destruction and Cyrus's exit, Dialga and Palkia rampaged, creating a danger for [[Sinnoh]]. However, the two were calmed down and sent away with the help of the {{an|lake guardians}}.

In ''[[M18|Hoopa and the Clash of Ages]]'', Dialga was one of six Legendary Pokémon summoned and hypnotized by the shadow {{form|Hoopa|Hoopa Unbound}} as its reinforcements. It and its teammates engaged in a battle against the {{p|Latios}}, {{p|Latias}}, and {{Shiny}} {{p|Rayquaza}} summoned to protect the real {{an|Hoopa}} in [[Dahara City]]. Eventually, after the shadow Hoopa was sealed in a [[Prison Bottle]], the hypnosis on Dialga and the other Legendary Pokémon was lifted, and Dialga departed for its home.

====Minor appearances====
Dialga debuted in a fantasy in ''[[DP036|A Secret Sphere of Influence!]]''.

Dialga appeared in a fantasy in ''[[DP097|Double Team Turnover!]]''.

===Pokémon Adventures===
{{main|Pokémon of myth (Adventures)}}
===={{MangaArc|Diamond & Pearl}}====
Dialga first appeared in ''[[PS410|Creeping Away from Cradily]]''. Dialga, along with Palkia, was summoned by [[Cyrus]] in order to create a new world. Cyrus used the Red Chains to force Dialga and Palkia to fight each other in order to distort time and space and create a portal that would swallow the existing world. {{adv|Diamond}}, {{adv|Pearl}} and {{adv|Platinum}} worked together with their Pokémon to free Dialga and Palkia from their controlled states.

Later on, an accident with handling [[Charon]]'s machine caused Dialga, Palkia and Cyrus to be dragged into the portal before it closed completely.

===={{MangaArc|Platinum}}====
It was revealed that {{p|Giratina}} imprisoned both Dialga and Palkia in the [[Distortion World]] before setting off into the current dimension to wreak havoc. Soon, Cyrus and Diamond met in the Distortion World, and agreed to free Dialga and Palkia using their {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. Dialga and Palkia later resumed their struggle against Giratina in the Distortion World. When Charon decided to escape from the Distortion World on Giratina, Diamond got on Dialga and chased after him. Giratina was eventually defeated, with Dialga and Palkia forcing it back into the Distortion World for good before both returned to the Spear Pillar.

===={{MangaArc|HeartGold & SoulSilver}}====
Dialga was created in the [[Sinjoh Ruins]], along with Palkia and Giratina, by {{p|Arceus}}'s creation process, which was forced by [[Team Rocket]]'s {{tc|Executive}}s. Knowing that the creation process would threaten the [[Johto]] region, Team Rocket's true leader {{adv|Giovanni}} returned with [[Lance]] and [[Pryce]] to keep the Pokémon of myth at bay while {{adv|Gold}} tried to calm Arceus down. Dialga was kept at bay by Pryce and his {{p|Swinub}}. Once Arceus was eventually becalmed, Dialga and Palkia departed from Johto and were spotted by [[Cynthia]].

===Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blazing Exploration Team===
{{main|Primal Dialga}}
Primal Dialga first appeared in [[BET3]].

==In the TCG==
{{main|Dialga (TCG)}}

==Other appearances==
===[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]===
[[File:SSBBSpearPillarDialga.png|thumb|250px|Dialga on the {{St|Spear Pillar}} stage in [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]]]
Dialga appears as a stage Pokémon along with {{p|Palkia}}, {{p|Cresselia}}, and the [[lake guardians]] on the stage {{St|Spear Pillar}}. It affects the stage much differently than that of its counterpart, such as slowing down time, and even going off its post to attack the players in the middle. It can also distort the stage, like Palkia, but only slightly and not as extreme, as well as shoot beams from various locations.

====Trophy information====
''A Temporal Pokémon. This [[legendary Pokémon]] is talked about as a deity in [[Sinnoh myths|fables]] passed down through generations in the [[Sinnoh]] [[region]]. Identifiable by the diamondlike crystal in the center of its chest, Dialga is said to have set time in motion at the moment of its birth. Its fearsome {{m|Roar of Time}} attack is so powerful that it must refrain from attacking on the next turn. It is {{game|Diamond}}'s [[Game mascot|mascot]].''

===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for Wii U]]===
Dialga appears as a trophy.

====Trophy information====
''The concept of time has always been one of the world's great mysteries, but Dialga might hold the answer. Legend has it that Dialga's birth caused time to begin moving! It's no surprise that the people of Sinnoh see this Pokémon as a deity. If you're ever running late, maybe you could ask Dialga to do you a favour and turn back the clock.''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
[[File:SSBUSpearPillarDialga.png|thumb|250px|Dialga on the {{St|Spear Pillar}} stage in [[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]]]
Dialga reprises its role as a stage hazard on the returning {{St|Spear Pillar}} stage. Spear Pillar now allows for any of the three Legendary Pokémon to appear each time, rather than being set for the whole match. Unlike in ''Brawl'', Cresselia is now signified by the stage's color tint not changing from its new default green, rather than using Dialga's blue. Dialga also appears as a {{sbw|Spirit}}.
{{-}}

==Trivia==
[[File:Temporal World.png|thumb|right|250px|Dialga's world in ''[[M12|Arceus and the Jewel of Life]]'']]
* In games prior to {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, Dialga has a catch rate of 30.
* Dialga has the highest base {{stat|Special Attack}} stat of all {{type|Steel}} Pokémon.
* The gem on Dialga's chest resembles a Prism [[Sphere]].
* Although Dialga is gender unknown in the [[core series]] games, it is referred to as male in {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}}'s story; it is still gender unknown for purposes of gameplay.
* Dialga is the only [[Legendary Pokémon]] to have a role in four different movies.
* Dialga and {{p|Palkia}} are the only two {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that can be legitimately caught in every kind of [[Poké Ball]] in the core series to date (besides the [[Park Ball]], which cannot be the registered Poké Ball of any Pokémon), as they are the only two Pokémon that can be caught with the [[Origin Ball]].
* Although the portal to [[Dimension#Dialga's world|Dialga's world]] appears in [[core series]] games, the inside of that world has only been shown in the {{pkmn|animated series}}.
* According to [[Junichi Masuda]]'s blog, the Spanish translation team for [[Pokémon]] suggested changing the name Dialga because of its similarity to the Spanish word ''alga'' (algae, seaweed).<ref>[https://www.gamefreak.co.jp/blog/dir_english/2008/02/index.html "HIDDEN POWER of masuda" Director's Columns, No.122] (February 18, 2008)</ref>

===Origin===
Dialga, along with {{p|Palkia}}, may be based on the {{wp|Shinto}} legend of {{wp|Izanami}} and {{wp|Izanagi}}, who are said to have created one island with a spear, erected a pillar on it, and from there created the islands of Japan. Appearance-wise, Dialga seems to be based on short-necked sauropod dinosaurs such as ''{{wp|Camarasaurus}}'' or ''{{wp|Brachytrachelopan}}''. The turquoise pattern on its body is vaguely reminiscent of clock hands, where the ends of the "clock hands" are diamond-shaped.

Its {{t|Steel}} [[type]] is likely to come from the concept of {{wp|adamant}}, which is an archaic word for diamond, meaning "unconquerable", where the qualities of hard metal (probably steel) were attributed to it. It is also possibly due to the hardness of {{wp|diamond}}s, the fact that metal is known to last long periods of time, or the fact that most parts of a clock are made of metal, such as the gears. It may also be because diamonds are compressed carbon, and steel is an alloy from iron and carbon. Metaphorically, it could be a reference to the rigid and unaltering pattern of passing time, as metals are known for their resilience against physical forces. The Steel-type might also represent the solid {{wp|state of matter}}, whereas Palkia's {{type|Water}} represents the liquid state and {{p|Giratina}}'s {{type|Ghost}} represents the gaseous state.

Dialga's Origin Forme appears to be based on {{p|Arceus}}. Like with Arceus, it may be based on a ''{{wp|qilin}}'' or ''{{wp|Longma}}'', as it possesses both equine and dragon-like qualities, the latter of which are more pronounced in Dialga's case due to its {{t|Dragon}} type.

====Name origin====
Dialga may be derived from ''diamond''. It may also involve ''día'' (Spanish for ''day'', referring to the unit of time) or ''dial'' of {{wp|clock face|clock dial}}, {{wp|sundial}}, and 頑 ''ga'' (tough, referring to their solid state of matter theme).
