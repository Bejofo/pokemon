'''Vulpix''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ロコン''' ''Rokon'') is a {{type|Fire}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s into {{p|Ninetales}} when exposed to a [[Fire Stone]].

In [[Alola]], Vulpix has an {{type|Ice}} [[regional form]]. It evolves into Alolan Ninetales when exposed to an [[Ice Stone]]. These Vulpix can also be found in [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]].

==Biology==
[[File:Enta Vulpix one tail CBF.png|thumb|250px|A one-tailed Vulpix as seen in [[Pokémon Battle Frontier]]]]
Vulpix is a small, quadrupedal, {{wp|canidae|canine}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. It has a red-brown pelt with a cream-colored underbelly. It has brown eyes, large, pointed ears with dark brown insides, and a triangular dark brown nose. Its paws are slightly darker than the rest of its pelt and have light brown paw pads. On top of its head are three curled locks of orange fur with bangs, and it has orange tails with curled tips. It is most commonly seen with six tails. However, Vulpix is born with only a white tail that splits as Vulpix {{pkmn|aging|grows}}. The tails grow hot as Vulpix approaches Evolution.

Vulpix can manipulate fire to such precision as to create floating wisps of flame. These wisps are sometimes mistaken for ghosts by humans, but Vulpix uses them to assist in catching prey. Inside its body is a flame that never goes out. When the temperature outside increases, it will expel flames from its mouth to prevent its body from overheating. Vulpix performs this even when sleeping, as mentioned in the [[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]].<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex entry]]: "Inside Vulpix's body burns a flame that never goes out. Sometimes, while sleeping, this Pokémon releases flames from its mouth to adjust its internal body temperature and prevent it from growing too hot."</ref> Vulpix is known to feign injury to escape from opponents too powerful for it to defeat. Vulpix is most commonly found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|grassy plains}}.

===Forms===
[[File:Alolan Vulpix SM concept art.jpg|thumb|right|250px|In Alola, Keokeo are as white as snow]]
Vulpix has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Alolan}} Vulpix.

In the [[Alola]] region, Vulpix has adapted to snowy mountain peaks and developed a snowy white pelt. It has pale blue paws, blue eyes, and dark blue inside its ears. Its snout is more pronounced and pointed than that of non-Alolan Vulpix. The locks of hair on its head and its six tails are curlier and have a wispy appearance.

Alolan Vulpix is believed to have arrived in the region at the same time as humans but moved to the snow-capped mountain to avoid other Pokémon. It can be found in small packs, called skulks, that are led and protected by Ninetales.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20171219113753mp_/https://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/alolan-vulpix/ | Alolan Vulpix (Archived)]</ref> Alolan Vulpix can expel breath as cold as −58&nbsp;°F (−50&nbsp;°C), which is capable of freezing anything. While it is not suited to warmer environments, its tail can produce ice to lower the surrounding temperature if needed. An old, local name for this Pokémon is "Keokeo", referring to its white pelt. {{p|Weavile}} is a natural predator of Alolan Vulpix. They can also be found in the [[Polar Biome]] of [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]], where Alola's island life is simulated. As mentioned in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Alolan Vulpix prefers to sleep in freezing cold places. Whenever its resting spot starts to warm up, Alolan Vulpix will use its cold breath to change the surrounding area into a more comfortable temperature.

===Evolution===
Vulpix evolves into {{p|Ninetales}}.

{{rf|Alolan}} Vulpix evolves into Alolan Ninetales.

==Trivia==
* In English, the {{pkmn|category}} "Fox Pokémon" is shared by Vulpix, {{p|Fennekin}}, {{p|Nickit}}, and their [[Evolution]]s.
** In Japanese, the hiragana category "きつねポケモン" (''Fox Pokémon'') is shared by the evolutionary lines of Vulpix and Nickit, while the katakana version "キツネポケモン" (''Fox Pokémon'') is shared by Fennekin and its Evolutions.
* The beta {{DL|Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon names}} in {{2v2|Red|Blue}} listed Vulpix as ''Foxfire''.
* Vulpix and Ninetales are the only Pokémon whose [[Alolan form]]s are obtainable in {{g|Legends: Arceus}}.
* Vulpix can be seen as a parallel to {{p|Growlithe}}. Both are {{cat|Generation I Pokémon}} that evolve once via a [[Fire Stone]]. Vulpix is exclusive to {{game|Red and Green|s|Pokémon Green}}, international Blue, {{game|Gold and Silver|s|Silver}}, {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s|LeafGreen}}, and {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s|SoulSilver}} while Growlithe is to Red, {{pkmn|Blue Version (Japanese)|Japanese Blue}}, Gold, FireRed, and HeartGold. Growlithe has a 75% chance of being male while Vulpix has a 75% of being female, they are both in the {{egg3|Field}}, can have {{a|Flash Fire}} as their Ability, and are yellow when {{Shiny}} from [[Generation III]] on. Furthermore, both are based primarily on canine-like creatures of Japanese folklore: Vulpix from the ''{{wp|kitsune}}'', Growlithe from the ''{{wp|shisa}}''. Additionally, both have received [[regional form]]s.
* Alolan Vulpix can be seen as a parallel to Alolan {{p|Sandshrew}}. Both were initially introduced in [[Generation I]] and got Alolan forms in {{g|Sun and Moon}}. Both {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} are {{t|Ice}} types, with Vulpix being exclusive to Sun and Scarlet and Sandshrew being exclusive to Moon and Violet. Furthermore, both Pokémon evolve when exposed to an [[Ice Stone]].
* Vulpix is the only Pokémon with a base stat total of 299.
* Vulpix has the lowest base [[HP]] of all {{type|Fire}} Pokémon.
* Alolan Vulpix is the only unevolved Pokémon to have a [[Pokémon V (TCG)|Pokémon VSTAR]] card.
* Vulpix's [[National Pokédex]] [[List of Pokémon by National Pokédex number|number]] and [[List of Pokémon by Kitakami Pokédex number|Kitakami Pokédex]] number are identical: 0037 for the former, and 37 for the latter.

===Concept and development===
Vulpix and its Evolution were designed by [[Atsuko Nishida]].<ref>[https://funs-project.com/poplab/007/index_2.html)</ref>

===Origin===
Vulpix is based on a {{wp|fox}}<ref>[https://funs-project.com/poplab/007/index_2.html Fun's Project interview with Atsuko Nishida (Page 2)]</ref>. It may be based on a {{wp|red fox}} and the 狐 ''{{wp|kitsune}}'' of {{wp|Japanese mythology|Japanese legend}}, which are said to have many tails, extremely long lifespans, and supernatural powers such as the ability to breathe fire. After reaching an advanced age, ''kitsune'' take on {{wp|spirit}} forms, which may explain why Vulpix can learn various {{type|Ghost}} and {{type|Psychic}} moves. Its Shiny coloration may reference the 九尾の狐 kyūbi-no-kitsune or the 金狐 kinko, types of kitsune with golden fur.

Alolan Vulpix may be based on an {{wp|Arctic fox}}, which grows a white coat of fur in the winter to {{wp|camouflage}} in the snow.

====Name origin====
Vulpix may be a combination of ''vulpes'' (Latin for ''fox'') and ''six''. It may also involve ''{{wp|Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan}}'', the Roman god of fire.

Its Alolan name, Keokeo, may be derived from ''keʻokeʻo'' (Hawaiian for ''white'').

Rokon may be a combination of 六 ''roku'' (six), こん ''kon'' (onomatopoetic sound of a fox's cry), and 焜炉 ''konro'' ({{wp|gas stove}}). It may also involve 恨 ''kon'' (grudge; from the curse its {{p|Ninetales|Evolution}} may cast on its foes).
