'''Cyclizar''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''モトトカゲ''' ''Mototokage'') is a dual-type {{2t|Dragon|Normal}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation IX]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

The [[Paradox Pokémon]] {{p|Koraidon}} and {{p|Miraidon}} are said to be either ancient and future relatives of Cyclizar, respectively, or counterparts of it from parallel timelines.

==Biology==
[[File:Dragon Rampage Gang Cyclizar.png|thumb|left|250px|A group of Cyclizar fitted with riding equipment]]
Cyclizar is a green reptilian Pokémon resembling a lizard. Its head is mostly black, with a green coloration between its {{wp|Casque (anatomy)|casque}} and lower jaw, along with orange circular cheeks. Its neck, paw pads, and tail are also black; the latter has a white tip. Its rear has a covering resembling a motorcycle seat, located at the base of its tail. On its throat is a black sac with a white inner coloring, resembling a rubber tire.

Cyclizar has a mild temperament. It has been kept by humans and used for transport since ancient times, with depictions of this behavior found in murals dating back 10,000 years ago. This relationship appears to be mutualistic since the warmth of Cyclizar's rider helps it avoid getting cold, along with lifting its spirit. When carrying a human, Cyclizar can reach a speed of over 70&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h). Cyclizar maintains its balance and absorbs shock while running by using its hard head and thick yet supple tail. It also uses its head and tail to attack during battles.<ref>[https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon/cyclizar/ Cyclizar — Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet | Official Website]</ref> Cyclizar is strong enough to carry luggage and equipment used by humans. It has been seen equipped with metal seats and headlights, allowing humans to ride it more easily and navigate. In other cases, it has been seen equipped with a jet seat, allowing it to move faster as seen with [[Team Star]].

Both {{p|Koraidon}} and {{p|Miraidon}} share a resemblance to Cyclizar, a detail noted in their own Pokédex entries and by several people in [[Paldea]]; it is later confirmed in the aforementioned games that they are ancient and futuristic relatives of Cyclizar, respectively. According to [[Jacq]], Cyclizar has three [[form]]s. First, Cyclizar's basic form is where it walks on all four legs. Second, the battle form is where it stands on its hind legs in order to battle. Finally, the ride form, which it assumes when humans ride on it. When Cyclizar is being ridden on, it puffs up its throat sac and curls its tail, making the appearance of wheels.

==Trivia==
* Cyclizar shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Skiddo}} and {{p|Gogoat}}. They are all known as the Mount Pokémon.
* Cyclizar has several unique attributes:
** It is the only {{type|Dragon}} [[Pokémon (species)|Pokémon]] in the {{egg|Field}} [[Egg Group]].
** It is the [[List of Pokémon with unique base stat totals|only Pokémon]] with a base stat total of 501.
** It is the only [[Generation IX]] Pokémon with a [[Paradox Pokémon]] counterpart.
*** It is also the only known Pokémon that is shorter than its {{p|Miraidon|future Paradox Pokémon relative}}.
* Cyclizar is one of three Pokémon with more than one Paradox Pokémon counterpart, the others being {{p|Donphan}} and {{p|Volcarona}}.

===Origin===
Cyclizar may be based on lizards, most notably the {{wp|Dactyloidae|anole}} and the genera ''{{wp|Sitana}}'' and ''{{wp|Sarada (lizard)|Sarada}}'' — the latter two are collectively known as fan-throated lizards. It also has traits from other lizard species: its foot pads resemble those of the {{wp|gecko}}, its tail resembles the prehensile tail of the {{wp|chameleon}}, and its {{wp|Casque (anatomy)|casque}} appears to be based on that of the chameleon or the {{wp|Corytophanidae|helmeted lizards}}. Some elements of its design appear to be based on parts of a motorcycle: its casque resembles both a motorcycle windshield and a helmet, its cheeks are similar to turn signal lights, its rear looks like a motorcycle seat, and the protrusion on its chest together with its tail resemble rubber tires, the latter especially when curled. The idea of being both lizard and motorcycle, as well as Cyclizar's {{t|Dragon}} typing, may be inspired by the {{wp|Ctenophorus cristatus|bicycle dragon}}.

Cyclizar may represent a "{{wp|Missing link (human evolution)|missing link}}" between {{p|Koraidon}} and {{p|Miraidon}}, with its anatomy reflecting an intermediate state between the two. For example, Koraidon's second and third digits are separated but connected by a skin membrane, whereas Cyclizar's seem to be partially fused, and Miraidon's are fully fused. Cyclizar and Miraidon share an elongated crest, subtympanic shields, a beak-like snout, and a lack of feathers, while Cyclizar and Koraidon share black tire-like scales on the tail and chest region, black pads on the inner sides of their feet, and a lack of exposed claws.

====Name origin====
Cyclizar may be a combination of ''cycle'' and ''lizard''.

Mototokage may be a combination of ''moto'' (Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese for motorcycle) and 蜥蜴 ''tokage'' (lizard).
