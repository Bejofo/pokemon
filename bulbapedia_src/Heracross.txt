'''Heracross''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ヘラクロス''' ''Heracros'') is a dual-type {{2t|Bug|Fighting}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation II]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Heracross can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Heracross''' using the [[Heracronite]].

==Biology==
[[File:HeracrossScarletViolet2.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Heracross's wings]]
Heracross is a bipedal, {{wp|Coleoptera|coleopteran}} {{wp|insect|insectoid}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} covered in a blue exoskeleton as hard as steel. There is a long, pronged horn on its forehead. The horn ends in a cross on males and a heart-shape on females. On either side of the horn is a short antenna with a spherical tip. Heracross has oval, yellow eyes. Its forearms have a pair of spikes near the wrists, while its thighs have a single spike each. It has two claws on its hands, and a single long claw on each foot. There is a single pair of wings covered by {{wp|elytron|elytra}}, which can be seen during its release from a Poké Ball in the 3D games. Heracross's claws allow it to dig into the ground for sturdy footing and also allow it to climb trees.

Heracross possesses very high physical strength, but its flying capabilities are less impressive. It can use its horn to throw opponents or to compete for food, and can lift and throw objects 100 times its own weight. Heracross uses its two antennae to search for food by scent, and is especially fond of tree sap. As mentioned in {{g|Sleep}}, Heracross is known to occasionally sleep while licking the sap it finds.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref> This occurs as it can become exhausted from a potentially difficult search for sweet sap. It makes its habitat in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Forest Pokémon|boreal, temperate, and tropical forests}}. In [[Generation II]], {{m|Megahorn}} was its [[signature move]].

As seen in the ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' episode ''[[EP119|A Sappy Ending]]'', Heracross has been known to compete with Pokémon such as {{p|Pinsir}} for food. The same episode also shows Heracross allowing {{p|Butterfree}} to feed on tree sap after Heracross has finished its meal. In addition, it is shown to suck sap from {{type|Grass}} Pokémon such as {{p|Bulbasaur}}. In [[Alola]], Heracross get along better with Pinsir, as they both have rivalries with {{p|Vikavolt}}.

===Forms===
[[File:Mega Heracross arm cannon animated.png|thumb|left|<!-- As this is an animated PNG, please do not turn this into a thumbnail by determining a specific set image size! -->Mega Heracross' claws retracting into a weapon]]
Heracross can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Heracross.

Mega Heracross is bulkier than its previous form. Thin orange markings now rim its head, hands, and shoulders. Additionally, there is a half-circle, orange marking over its eyes. It now has a long, pointed nose that curves slightly upward. Its back now lacks wings and is completely yellow. The horn on its head has grown into a large, simple spike with two smaller spikes on the front. The antennae have lengthened as well and now have ovoid tips. Mega Heracross's forearms have thickened and lost their spines. Sometimes, when attacking, particularly with a [[multistrike move]], its exoskeletal shell on the upper side of its arms opens up, revealing a segmented yellow skin layer filled with holes, which let air enter and exit from its forearms. During these attacks, its claws simultaneously retract, allowing Mega Heracross to fire various types of ammunition at a rapid pace, such as {{m|Bullet Seed|seeds}}, {{m|Pin Missile|spikes}}, and {{m|Rock Blast|rocks}}.

This Pokémon has a high body temperature, so it opens the shells of its arms and torso to allow heat to escape.<ref>http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/pokemon/mega_pokemon/#Heracross</ref> Mega Heracross boasts such incredible strength that it can lift objects up to 500 times its own weight between its horns. This same strength allows Mega Heracross to lift a fighter plane. However, it is left with muscular soreness after reverting to its original form.

===={{MangaArc|Yellow}}====
Heracross is first seen in ''[[PS090|The Legend]]''. While {{adv|Silver}} is communicating with {{adv|Green}} following the conclusion of this chapter, he stands in a full shot of [[Sprout Tower]] with a bunch of [[Johto]] Pokémon in the background, Heracross being one of them.

Afterwards, he protected Bugsy after he activated the runes in the chamber where they encountered Suicune. Heracross faced the Legendary Pokémon but was easily swatted away, forcing Bugsy to switch to another tactic.

==Trivia==
* Heracross can be seen as a counterpart to {{p|Pinsir}}, replacing {{p|Scyther}} in that role, which gained an Evolution in [[Generation II]]. Both are {{type|Bug}} Pokémon based on beetles and lack an evolutionary line. Pinsir is not part {{t|Fighting}} like Heracross, but it learns several Fighting-type moves by leveling up. Excluding the [[Friend Safari]], both Pokémon and their [[Mega Stone]]s are versions exclusives in {{g|X and Y}}: Heracross and [[Heracronite]] are exclusive to Y while Pinsir and [[Pinsirite]] are exclusive to X. Each Mega Stone can be found in [[Santalune Forest]] in their respective versions. The heights of both Pokémon are the same, even when Mega Evolved. The Pokémon are also version exclusives in the [[Pokémon Sword and Shield Expansion Pass]]. Heracross can be found on the [[Isle of Armor]] if playing Shield, whereas Pinsir can be found in its place when playing Sword.
* Mega Heracross has the highest base {{stat|Attack}} stat of all {{type|Bug}} Pokémon.
* Mega Heracross is tied with Mega Pinsir, Mega {{p|Scizor}}, and {{p|Genesect}} for the highest base stat total of all Bug-type Pokémon.
* Heracross is one of fourteen Pokémon that one could collect [[foreign Pokédex entries]] for in {{game|Diamond and Pearl|s}}.
* Heracross is the only {{type|Fighting}} Pokémon in the {{egg3|Bug}}.

===Origin===
Heracross appears to be based on the {{wp|Japanese rhinoceros beetle}}. These beetles are known for their incredible strength and use in {{wp|insect fighting}}, which explains its {{t|Fighting}} type.

Mega Heracross appears to be based on a {{wp|Hercules beetle}}.

====Name origin====
Heracross and Heracros may be a combination of ''{{wp|Hercules beetle}}'' (species of rhinoceros beetle named after the hero in the classical Greco-Roman mythology for its great strength), Ἡρακλῆς ''{{wp|Heracles|Hēraklēs}}'' (divine hero in Greek mythology who lent his name to his {{wp|Hercules|Roman mythological analogue}}), and ''cross''.
