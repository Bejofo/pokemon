'''Corsola''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''サニーゴ''' ''Sunnygo'') is a dual-type {{2t|Water|Rock}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation II]].

In [[Galar]], Corsola has a {{type|Ghost}} [[regional form]]. Galarian Corsola [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Cursola}} starting at [[level]] 38. Johtonian Corsola is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.

==Biology==
Corsola is a small, pink, roundish {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with branch-like growths on its back, which are similar to coral. There is a smaller, blunt horn on its forehead, and it has oval-shaped black eyes and a smiling mouth. It has a light blue underside, which speckles towards the sides. Its four legs and two arms are blunt and stubby.

Smaller Pokémon like {{p|Horsea}} and {{p|Luvdisc}} are sometimes sheltered by Corsola's branches and even offer it protection from foes. Corsola's horn is a prized material, commonly used for jewelry and carving, as seen in the ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' episode ''[[EP213|A Corsola Caper!]]''. Some people keep Corsola branches as charms to promote safe childbirth. Corsola's branches glitter very beautifully in seven colors when they catch sunlight. If any branch breaks off, this Pokémon grows it back in just one night.

Found in the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Sea Pokémon|warm shallow waters}} of southern seas, Corsola requires clean water to live. If its habitat is dirty, the growths on its back become discolored and degenerate. However, when it is healthy, its growths regularly shed and grow back; it is able to regrow them over the course of a single night. It forms large social groups. Occasionally, these groups get so large that people may live atop them, as is the case in [[Pacifidlog Town]]. 

In the [[Alola]] [[region]], {{p|Mareanie}} and {{p|Toxapex}} are natural predators of Corsola, preying on its branches. If pursued by them, Corsola will sometimes snap its own branches off as a diversion. Conversely, Mareanie and Toxapex do not prey on Corsola in the [[Galar]] region, having not developed a taste for its branches.

===Forms===
[[File:GalarianCorsolaRebelClash78.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Galarian Corsola without its branches]]
Corsola has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Galarian}} Corsola.

Galarian Corsola were wiped out by sudden changes in the climate and ocean temperature, turning them into {{type|Ghost}}s. Its body is a bleached white with half-closed pink eyes and a perpetual frown, and its arms, horn, and branches are wavy and translucent. These branches are incorporeal and can disappear at will, revealing the holes in Galarian Corsola's shell. They cannot cause injuries or pain, but they can be used to take root inside and drain the life force of others, and will immobilize the victim until Galarian Corsola lets them go.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon-galar-region/corsola/ Galarian Corsola | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref> 

Galarian Corsola are commonly found in the remains of prehistoric seas, and while they can be mistaken for ordinary rocks, they will curse anybody who kicks them by accident. Galarian Corsola consumes spirit energy from the life force its absorbs. This diet eventually causes Corsola's shell to break, its body to become incorporeal, and its spirit energy to pour out, thus completing its Evolution into {{p|Cursola}}.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon-galar-region/cursola/ Cursola | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref>

It wandered into a group of Corsola raised by [[Andrea]] and her family living in [[Yellow Rock Isle]].

==In the TCG==
{{main|Corsola (TCG)}}

==In the TFG==
One Corsola figure has been released.

* {{TFG|Next Quest}}: {{TFG ID|Next Quest|Corsola|15}}

==Trivia==
* Corsola can be seen as a parallel to {{p|Farfetch'd}} in {{g|Sword and Shield}}. Both of their original region's forms do not evolve, and they have mono-typed [[regional form]]s which can evolve once. At the [[Stow-on-Side Stadium]] and during the [[Champion Cup]] Finals, [[Allister]] in Pokémon Shield uses Galarian Corsola's Evolution, {{p|Cursola}}, in his team — while [[Bea]] in Pokémon Sword uses Galarian Farfetch'd's Evolution, {{p|Sirfetch'd}}, in her team.
* Corsola is the only Generation II Pokémon in the {{egg|Water 3}} [[Egg Group]].
* Galarian Corsola and its Evolution are the only {{type|Ghost}} Pokémon in both {{egg|Water 1}} and {{egg3|Water 3}}s.
* Galarian Corsola is the only {{type|Ghost}} Pokémon to have {{DL|List of Pokémon by shape|Pokémon with an insectoid body|an insectoid body}}.

===Origin===
Corsola appears to be based on {{wp|coral}}, specifically [[wp:Scleractinia|stony coral]], whose mineral based skeletons may have inspired its Rock typing. It may also be based on {{wp|precious coral}}, which is used as a precious stone.

Galarian Corsola appears to be based on {{wp|coral bleaching|bleached coral}}, a phenomenon in which coral expels the zooxanthellae that give it color, primarily because of rising water temperatures as a result of climate change. Its {{t|Ghost}} type may reference the high mortality rate of bleached coral. The way it immobilizes its prey may be inspired by the venomous stingers corals use to capture prey, which sometimes cause paralysis. These stingers are used more frequently by the naturally white deep-water corals.

Corsola's relationship with {{p|Mareanie}} and {{p|Toxapex}} may be a reference to real life predation of coral polyps by the {{wp|crown-of-thorns starfish}}.

====Name origin====
Corsola may be a combination of ''coral'' and ''sole'' (a piece of coral) or ''solar''.

Sunnygo may be a combination of ''sunny'' and 珊瑚 ''sango'' (coral).
