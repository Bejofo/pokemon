'''Geodude''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''イシツブテ''' ''Isitsubute'') is a dual-type {{2t|Rock|Ground}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Graveler}} starting at [[level]] 25, which evolves into {{p|Golem}} when [[Trade Evolution|traded]] or when exposed to a [[Linking Cord]].

In [[Alola]], Geodude has a dual-type {{2t|Rock|Electric}} [[regional form]]. It evolves into {{rf|Alolan}} Graveler starting at level 25, which evolves into Alolan Golem when traded. These Geodude can also be found in [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]]. 

(Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for more details.)

==Biology==
Geodude is a brownish-gray {{wp|boulder}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. It has bulging, rocky eyebrows, trapezoidal eyes with brown pupils, and a wide mouth. Its arms are muscular with five-fingered hands. Geodude uses its arms to climb steadily up steep mountain paths. As a result of their physical appearance, {{p|Rhyperior}} sometimes mistake this Pokémon for actual boulders and fire them through their hands.

Geodude is proud of its {{a|Sturdy|sturdy body}} and will bash against others of its kind in a contest of sorts to prove whose body is harder. It will even go as far as to compare itself with other species such as {{p|Roggenrola}} and {{p|Carbink}}. The longer it lives, the more chipped and worn its body becomes. Long-lived Geodude are completely smooth and round and they have a calm demeanor. However, Geodude's heart remains rugged and tough, no matter what. Geodude can be most often found on {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Mountain Pokémon|mountain trails and fields}}, with a scholar counting about 100 of them on just one route. It will sit still in these areas, which is why it is often mistaken for a rock. It is often stepped on and will sometimes swing its arms in anger when this occurs. When Geodude sleeps deeply, it buries itself halfway into the ground. Once buried, it will not awaken even if someone steps on it. In the morning, Geodude rolls downhill in search of food.

===Forms===
Geodude has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Alolan}} Geodude.

In the [[Alola]] region, Geodude is made from a magnetic rock with a more silvery appearance. There are areas on Alolan Geodude's body that are especially magnetic and attract iron sand, creating the appearance of black eyebrows and strands of short black hair.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170925010027mp_/http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/alolan-geodude/ | Alolan Geodude (Archived)]</ref> Its fingers are fused together, leaving only the thumb and index finger free. 

Stepping on Alolan Geodude results in an electrical shock and sometimes an angry headbutt. Like regular Geodude, it competes with others by bashing their bodies together. The iron sand sticks to the one with stronger magnetism. The Alolan {{p|Golem}} will fire these Geodude from its back if real rocks are absent. They can also be found in the [[Canyon Biome]] of [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]], where Alola's island life is simulated.

Alolan Geodude and its evolved forms are the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Galvanize}} as an [[Ability]].

===Evolution===
Geodude evolves into {{p|Graveler}}, which evolves into {{p|Golem}}.

{{rf|Alolan}} Geodude has a dual-type {{2t|Rock|Electric}} [[regional form]]. It evolves into Alolan Graveler, which evolves into Alolan Golem.

* {{TFG|Groundbreakers}}: {{TFG ID|Groundbreakers|Geodude|8}}

==Other appearances==
===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]===
Geodude is the final Poké Float to appear in the [[Poké Floats]] stage. As the {{p|Unown}} float around the top half of the screen, Geodude floats across the bottom with its arms outstretched, providing a solid base for fighting. After it leaves the screen, there will be no Poké Floats on the screen for a few seconds, before {{p|Squirtle}} pops up and restarts the cycle.

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Geodude appears as a {{sbw|Spirits (characters)|Spirit}}.

==Trivia==
* In the Japanese game {{game|Blue|_(Japanese)}}, Geodude [[List of Pokémon by weight|weighs]] 2.0&nbsp;kg instead of 20.0&nbsp;kg (as it does in all other games). This has no mechanical significance, as no game mechanics use weight in the handheld [[Generation I]] games.
* Geodude is similar to {{p|Roggenrola}}: both are {{type|Rock}}, have {{a|Sturdy}} as one of their {{Abilities}}, evolve at level 25, and reach their final forms when [[trade]]d.
* Geodude is the only Rock type Pokémon to be part of a three-stage evolutionary line in Generation I.
** Although the Rock type {{p|Rhyhorn}} has a three-stage evolutionary line, its final Evolution, {{p|Rhyperior}}, was not introduced until [[Generation IV]].
* Geodude's evolutionary line is the only three-stage evolutionary line in which all members have a [[regional form]].
* Alolan Geodude has the lowest base {{stat|Special Attack}} stat of all {{type|Electric}} Pokémon.
* Alolan Geodude and its evolutionary relatives were designed by [[Hitoshi Ariga]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/ariga_megamix/status/804500572967555072 Tweet by ありがひとし/ArigaHitoshi (@ariga_megamix).] Posted on December 2, 2016.</ref>
* {{p|Burmy}}, {{p|Wormadam}}, {{p|Mothim}}, Geodude, {{p|Graveler}} and {{p|Golem}} are the only Pokémon in all five [[List of Pokémon by Hisui Pokédex number|Hisui Pokédex]] sublistings.

===Origin===
Geodude, being a living {{wp|Rock (geology)|rock}} or {{wp|boulder}}, may be based on an earth {{wp|elemental}} creature like {{wp|golem}}.

Alolan Geodude seems to have dark structures made of {{wp|Piezoelectricity#Materials|piezoelectric crystals}} or {{wp|magnetite}}, a subset of iron ore known for its black crystalline appearance and magnetic properties. This iron ore takes shape of Geodude's {{wp|eyebrow}}s. Its {{t|Electric}} type may also be a pun on {{wp|thunderegg}}s.

====Name origin====
Geodude is a combination of ''[[Wiktionary:geo-|geo-]]'' (prefix for earth) and ''[[Wiktionary:dude|dude]]'' (slang word for a male person).<ref>'''{{DL|Television|PokéQuiz|ポケＱポン}}''' (PokéQuiz in Japanese): 正解はＧＥＯＤＵＤＥ！ジオドゥードです！ＧＥＯは地理に関すること　ＤＵＤＥは奴って意味なんですよ</ref> It may also involve ''{{wp|geode}}'' (hollow rock with crystals lined inside) and ''rude''.

Isitsubute is a combination of 石 ''ishi'' (stone) and 礫 ''tsubute'' (throwing stones).<ref>'''{{DL|Television|PokéQuiz}}''': The correct answer’s Ishitsubute! I-shee-tsu-bu-te! “Ishi” means rock, and “tsubute” is like a throwing stone. Don’t try to throw a Geodude, though, because you will probably get hurt!</ref>
