'''Applin''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''カジッチュ''' ''Kajicchu'') is a dual-type {{2t|Grass|Dragon}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation VIII]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Flapple}} when exposed to a [[Tart Apple]], {{p|Appletun}} when exposed to a [[Sweet Apple]], or {{p|Dipplin}} when exposed to a [[Syrupy Apple]]. Dipplin evolves into {{p|Hydrapple}} when [[level]]ed up while knowing {{m|Dragon Cheer}}.

==Biology==
Applin is a small, worm-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a light green body and a dark green underside. Its head is round with two pink nostrils. Above its head are two large leaf-like eyestalks which house its two small black eyes. These eyestalks give the apple it lives in the appearance of having a stem with leaves. Applin also has two thin hairs on the tip of its tail, as well as two stubby forelimbs which are usually hidden inside its apple.

Applin is both the [[List of Pokémon by weight|lightest]] and [[List of Pokémon by height|shortest]] {{type|Dragon}} Pokémon, and also one of the shortest {{type|Grass}} Pokémon. As soon as it is born, it burrows into an apple that looks like a [[Leppa Berry]], which serves as a home, food source, and protection against preying bird Pokémon. The apple is prevented from rotting thanks to Applin's body fluid, which also strengthens the fruit's rind. If Applin runs out of apples to eat or if it is separated from its apple, its body will lose moisture, and it will become dehydrated and weak.<ref>[https://wpes.pokemon.co.jp/en/ World Pokémon Ecological Society]: "When [Applin] runs [out] of... apple[s], it becomes dehydrated. That makes it weak, doesn't it?" ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0jnUPj41oo Video archive])</ref> Since Applin hides inside an apple, it is sometimes mistaken by the frugivorous {{p|Noibat}} for food. In [[Galar]], it is a custom to give an Applin as a romantic gesture. The flavor of the apple Applin lives in determines its [[Evolution]], the apples can be exceptionally [[Tart Apple|tart]], [[Sweet Apple|sweet]], or [[Syrupy Apple|syrupy]].

Applin, {{p|Flapple}}, and {{p|Appletun}} are the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Ripen}} as an [[Ability]].

==Trivia==
* Applin is the only Pokémon introduced in [[Generation VIII]] to have a [[List of Pokémon with branched Evolutions|branched Evolution]].
** Furthermore, Applin is the first Pokémon since {{p|Tyrogue}} in [[Generation II]] to have a branched Evolution path with more than two possible different species it can evolve into.
** Applin's evolutionary line (2 branches of a two-stage evolutionary line and 1 branch of a three-stage evolutionary line) is unique. It and {{p|Mime Jr.}} are the only Pokémon with a different number of Evolution stages in each branch of a branched evolutionary line (regular {{p|Mr. Mime}} does not evolve while {{rf|Galarian}} Mr. Mime does).
* Applin and its evolved forms:
** are the only Pokémon that are in both the {{egg|Grass}} and {{egg|Dragon}} [[Egg Group]]s.
** require only 600,000 experience points to reach level 100, the lowest among Generation VIII Pokémon, and the lowest among {{type|Dragon}} Pokémon along with {{p|Altaria}}.
* Applin has the lowest base {{stat|Speed}} stat of all Dragon-type Pokémon.
* In [[Generation IX]], Applin is the only Dragon-type Pokémon to not learn {{m|Draco Meteor}}.

===Origin===
Applin appears to be based on the popular image of a worm burrowing into an {{wp|apple}}; perhaps specifically the {{wp|larva}}e of various moths, such as the {{wp|geometer moth}} larvae (also known as the inchworm) and the {{wp|codling moth}} larvae, who burrow into apples and feed on their cores, inhibiting growth and ripening them earlier. It may also be based on the {{wp|mole lizard}}, which has two forelimbs and closely resembles an earthworm, but is actually a type of reptile related to snakes known as an {{wp|amphisbaenia}}.

Its Dragon typing, combined with its worm-like appearance, may be a pun on the {{wp|wyrm}}, a type of dragon. It may also reference specific dragons in various mythologies, such as the {{wp|Lindworm}} (a serpentine dragon often depicted with only two forelimbs), {{wp|Ladon (mythology)|Ladon}} (a dragon from {{wp|Greek mythology}} that guarded the {{wp|golden apple}}s in the {{wp|Garden of the Hesperides}}), or the {{wp|Serpents in the Bible|Biblical serpent}} who persuaded Eve to eat the {{wp|forbidden fruit}} of the {{wp|Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|tree of knowledge}}, which is often depicted as an apple.

====Name origin====
Applin may be a combination of ''apple'' and ''in''.

Kajicchu may be a combination of 齧る ''kajiru'' (to gnaw), 果実 ''kajitsu'' (fruit), and 虫 ''chū'' (bug; worm).
