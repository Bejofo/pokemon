'''Entei''' (Japanese: '''エンテイ''' ''Entei'') is a {{type|Fire}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation II]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

Along with {{p|Raikou}} and {{p|Suicune}}, it is one of the [[Legendary beasts]] said to be resurrected by {{p|Ho-Oh}} after the burning of the [[Burned Tower|Brass Tower]]. Out of the three beasts, Entei is said to represent the flames that burned the Brass Tower.

The [[Paradox Pokémon]] {{p|Gouging Fire}} is said to be either an ancient relative of Entei or a counterpart of it from a parallel timeline.

==Biology==
Entei is a massive, {{wp|lion|leonine}}, quadrupedal {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with some {{wp|mastiff}} qualities. It is covered in brown fur and a long, light gray cloud of smoke running along its entire back. It has gray plates on either side of the cloud and a plate beneath the cream belly fur on its chest. Entei has gray paws with brown pads and black cuff-like bands on its legs. Both front paws house three small, white retractable claws, which can be seen in battle or in [[Pokémon Camp]]. Its main faceplate is red and shaped like fins or a six-sided star. A gray plate, resembling a horseshoe mustache, covers its muzzle. It also has a yellow crest with three sloped points on its forehead and red eyes.

150 years ago, [[Burned Tower|Brass Tower]] in [[Johto]] was hit by a lightning bolt, causing it to catch on a huge fire and would be later put out by a sudden downpout. [[List of disputed and unidentified Pokémon|Three unnamed Pokémon]] perished in the fire, however, the [[Legendary Pokémon]] {{p|Ho-Oh}} granted the trio new life, one of those Pokémon was revived as Entei, which represents the fire that destroyed the now Burned Tower.

It is said that an Entei is born whenever a new volcano appears, and that whenever Entei roars, a volcano erupts somewhere in the world. Entei races across {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|grasslands}} at high speeds. It does this due to being unable to contain its extreme power. Entei is believed to represent the passion of magma, and is claimed to be the bringer of the summer's warmth. Entei can unleash massive bursts of fire capable of destroying anything it touches. Its fire is said to be hotter than the magma of a volcano. Entei loves [[Entei Treat]]s made by [[Snacksworth]], who once ran into and chased it in the past. {{p|Gouging Fire}} shares a resemblance to Entei. It is theorized to be an ancient Entei regenerated from a [[fossil]].

As mentioned in the [[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]], Entei is known to sometimes leak flames from its mouth.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex entry]]: "This Pokémon embodies the passion of magma. Flames apparently leak a little from Entei's mouth sometimes, even while it sleeps. After it has rested, it sweeps once more across the land, spewing waves of fire like an erupting volcano."</ref> It also leaks flames while it sleeps as well. After taking a good rest, Entei will sweep across the land, expelling waves of fire similar to an erupting volcano. Entei is known to enjoy eating Entei Biscuits. Entei can be lured over to a sleeping spot using the Entei Incense. Entei has three different sleep styles it sleeps in, they are called ''Energy-Storing Sleep'', ''Meditative Sleep'', and ''Volcano Sleep''.

===NPC appearances===
{{spoilers}}
* {{vg|Pokémon Ranger}}: [[Gordor]] considers Entei to be the best and most loyal of the Legendary trio. The player captures it when it is first unleashed in the [[Jungle Relic]], but it is still taken by the [[Go-Rock Squad]], using their new [[Super Styler]]. Entei later acts as the final boss of the game.
* {{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}}: {{mdc|Legendary beasts|smd|Entei}} encounters the {{player}} and their {{mdc|Partner Pokémon||partner}} along with {{mdc|Archen|smd}} soon after {{p|Latios}} and {{p|Latias}} are turned to stone. He later battles them on [[Fire Island Volcano]], with the player and partner evolving mid-battle thanks to their [[Harmony Scarf|Harmony Scarves]]. Entei is later turned to stone and helps free the player and partner from the [[Voidlands]]. He goes by the title "Entei the Volcanic".

====Melee trophy information====
''A volcanic Fire-type, Entei is hotter than liquid magma and as tough as nails. This powerful creature was one of the three Pokémon running around the Burned Tower of Ecruteak City. Entei is extremely difficult to capture, as it tends to wander all over the landscape, sprouting intense flames from its body.''

====Brawl trophy information====
''"A Volcano Pokémon. When Entei barks, a volcano erupts, and it's said that a new Entei is born every time a volcano appears. A proverb claims that the warmth of summer is created by Entei racing through the clouds. Entei uses {{m|Fire Spin}}, a flaming vortex that traps and damages foes for multiple turns."''

====3DS/Wii U trophy information====
'''NA:''' ''One of the three Legendary Pokémon that rose from the ashes of the Burned Tower. It has a distinct white mane running down its back. When brought into battle, it unleashes a powerful Fire Spin attack that pulls in enemies, damages them, and then launches them as the fires peter out. Ouch!''

'''PAL:''' ''One of the three Legendary Pokémon to rise from the ashes of the Burned Tower. It has a distinctive white mane running along its back.

** The same is true when switching to {{p|Espeon}}, when the Pokédex is sorted alphabetically.
* An [[Pokémon Gold and Silver beta#Events|unused event]] present in the data of {{game|Gold and Silver|s}} (but removed from {{v2|Crystal}}) allows for the player to obtain a level 40 Entei.
* Entei's [[Effort values|effort value]] [[List of Pokémon by effort value yield|yield]] of 1 HP and 2 Attack is unique.
* Entei's numbers in the [[National Pokédex]] and the [[List of Pokémon by Johto Pokédex number|Johto Pokédex]] are identical: 0244 and 244, respectively.

===Concept and development===
Entei, along with {{p|Raikou}} and {{p|Suicune}}, was designed by [[Muneo Saitō]].<ref>Yoshida, Yuuya (May 1, 2014). [https://kai-you.net/article/5034 伝説ポケモンのイラストを手がける斉藤むねお、キャラデザ講座開講！] Kai-You.</ref><ref>(January 3, 2012). Ken Sugimori ([https://twitter.com/SUPER_32X @SUPER_32X]) [https://twitter.com/SUPER_32X/status/154156622212640768 on Twitter]. ([https://archive.vn/WfQab archive])</ref>

In the [[Pokémon Gold and Silver Spaceworld '97 demo]], Entei is seen with a design resembling a fox or hound. In the final game, Entei has a bright orange palette and is seen without the bangs of fur that usually drape down the front of its design. This was changed in {{game|Crystal}}, which more accurately depicts Entei's final design.

When asked if Entei was based on a particular animal, Muneo Saitō described the creation process behind the Pokémon as "a hairy, rock-like body, volcanic smoke rising from behind its head, a king with a dignified beard... Entei's design was coming together... You could say it was basically like a lion... But I didn't want it to be simply an animal, so I settled on a silhouette that could look like a dog or a cat (or neither)." <ref name="Saitō">(January 3, 2012). Muneo Saitō ([https://twitter.com/muneondo @muneondo]) [https://twitter.com/muneondo/status/154175027464507392 on Twitter]. ([https://archive.vn/fktq1 archive])</ref>

===Origin===
Entei has characteristics of {{wp|lion}}s and other animals, such as dogs and cats. It also has some {{wp|king|regal}} elements.<ref name="Saitō"/> Entei also visually resembles an erupting volcano: its red faceplate and yellow crown resemble lava, its neck shape and brown coloration are reminiscent of the rocky base of a volcano, and it has a cloud of flowing smoke. Entei and its {{t|Fire}} typing represent the fire that burned [[Burned Tower|Brass Tower]] according to its legend; while {{p|Raikou}} represents the lightning that struck it, and {{p|Suicune}} represents the rain that put it out.

Entei may be inspired by some depictions of guardian lions in East Asia, such as the ''{{wp|komainu}}'', ''{{wp|shisa|shīsā}}'', or {{wp|Chinese guardian lions|''shíshī''}}. Its appearance and masses of fur are also similar to the {{wp|Barong (mythology)|Barong}}, a Balinese guardian lion spirit. Additionally, Entei also resembles certain breeds of large dogs, such as a {{wp|English Mastiff|mastiff}} or a {{wp|St. Bernard (dog breed)|St. Bernard}}.

====Name origin====
Entei may be derived from 炎 ''en'' (flame) and 帝 ''tei'' (emperor), forming a reference to 炎帝 ''Yándì'' ({{wp|Yan Emperor|Flame Emperor}}, legendary ancient Chinese ruler in pre-dynastic times). It may also involve 炎天 ''enten'' (blazing heat).
