'''Yungoos''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ヤングース''' ''Youngoose'') is a {{type|Normal}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation VII]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Gumshoos}} when [[level]]ed up in the [[Time-based Evolution|day]] starting at level 20.

==Biology==
Yungoos is a long-bodied {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} similar to a mongoose. It is covered in brown fur with a yellow stripe down its back and underside. It has short, rounded ears on the sides of its head, a short snout with a pink nose, and a large mouth full of pointed teeth. There are three black claws on each of its four short legs. Despite its length, Yungoos is thick-bodied and has a wide, flat tail with longer fur on the tip.

Yungoos has a voracious appetite and is always hungry, which in turn makes it more ferocious. Much of its body is dominated by its stomach, and it is able to digest food quickly. Its strong teeth allow it to crush and consume the hardest of objects. This Pokémon stalks through its territory searching for food until it passes out from exhaustion. However, it is believed that Yungoos decides its territory based on safety so that it can collapse anywhere without fear.<ref>[http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/yungoos/Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Yungoos]</ref> It is able to eat anything, but usually prefers fresh hunt. This Pokémon is found in [[Alola]], although it is not native to the region and was imported there. Prior to [[Generation VIII]], Yungoos and its evolved form, {{p|Gumshoos}}, were the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that could have {{a|Stakeout}} as an [[Ability]].

===Evolution===
Yungoos evolves into {{p|Gumshoos}}.

==Trivia==
* Yungoos may be considered a counterpart of {{rf|Alolan}} {{p|Rattata}}. They can be caught at certain times of the day (Yungoos at day, Alolan Rattata at night). They also evolve into {{p|Gumshoos}} and Alolan {{p|Raticate}}, respectively, at level 20 at their respective times. Also, their evolved forms are the Totem Pokémon in their respective games (Gumshoos in {{pkmn|Sun and Moon|Sun}} and {{pkmn|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|Ultra Sun}}, Raticate in {{pkmn|Sun and Moon|Moon}} and {{pkmn|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|Ultra Moon}}).
* Yungoos and its Evolution are the only Pokémon that have {{a|Stakeout}} as a standard [[Ability]] instead of a [[Hidden Ability]].

===Origin===
Yungoos appears to be based on a {{wp|mongoose}}, such as the {{wp|small Indian mongoose}}, which was imported to {{wp|Hawaii}} to counter the rat problems on sugar cane plantations. However, the small Indian mongoose is diurnal while rats are nocturnal, thus the small Indian mongoose was ineffective at its intended role and became an {{wp|invasive species}}. This is reflected in-game by the fact that Yungoos can only be found during the day, while Alolan Rattata can only be found at night.

In an interview with Game Informer published on October 19, 2016, [[Junichi Masuda]] and [[Shigeru Ohmori]] of [[GAME FREAK]] stated that the similarities between Yungoos and {{wp|Donald Trump}} were unintentional.<ref>Hilliard, Kyle (October 19, 2016). "[https://web.archive.org/web/20240522180212/https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2016/10/19/burning-questions-for-pokemon-sun-and-moon.aspx Burning Questions For Pokémon Sun & Moon.]" ''Game Informer'' (Archived on May 22, 2024.)</ref>
