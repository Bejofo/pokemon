'''Gastly''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ゴース''' ''Ghos'') is a dual-type {{2t|Ghost|Poison}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Haunter}} starting at [[level]] 25, which evolves into {{p|Gengar}} when [[Trade Evolution|traded]] or when exposed to a [[Linking Cord]].

(Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for more details.)

==Biology==
[[File:Gastly hands.png|thumb|left|200px|Gastly's "hands"]]
Gastly has no true form, due to 95% of its body being poisonous gas, with the other 5% believed to be made up of the souls of those who died from the gas. However, it consistently appears as a black, spherical {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} surrounded by a purple haze. Gastly has a wide, pink mouth with two visible fangs. Though its eyes seem to extend past its round body, visible eyelids surround them.

It produces a faint, sweet smell. The toxic gas surrounding the main body can induce fainting and suffocation, and it is capable of enshrouding an enemy of any size. Gastly's gaseous form makes it one of the [[List of Pokémon by weight|lightest Pokémon]] in existence. The ''Pokémon the Series'' episode ''[[EP023|The Tower of Terror]]'' suggests that Gastly has a playful personality, often frightening and playing pranks on people for fun. However, in the episode ''[[EP095|A Shipful of Shivers]]'', it shows a willingness to preserve or pass on the memories of departed humans. It is also shown in ''[[EP020|The Ghost of Maiden's Peak]]'' changing form and creating illusions, and it is capable of phasing through solid objects and forming tangible hands out of its gasses. Gastly can be found within {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Cave Pokémon|caves}} and old, dilapidated buildings, but may also be seen outdoors during nighttime. Its gaseous body will dwindle away when exposed to strong winds, so they huddle together in decent-sized groups under house eaves to avoid the wind. It may also cause flickering lights in abandoned houses. As mentioned in {{g|Sleep}}, Gastly is known to sleep while floating.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref> A sleeping Gastly is said give a sudden surprise should someone approach it.

In [[Generation I]], {{m|Night Shade}} was its [[signature move]].

===Evolution===
Gastly evolves into {{p|Haunter}}, which evolves into {{p|Gengar}}.

In the same episode, multiple Gastly hypnotized Team Rocket.

Gastly appears in the 3DS version as an enemy in Smash Run mode. It is immune to melee attacks.

Gastly also appears as a trophy in the 3DS version of the game.

====Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''This Ghost/Poison-type Pokémon is made up of several toxic gases—touching it would be really unpleasant. Instead, try to take it out with projectiles. It's not the fastest enemy in Smash Run, but occasionally it may try to chase down a fighter, so be careful around this gaseous foe.''

'''PAL''': ''In Smash Run, these Ghost- and Poison-type Pokémon tend to move slowly, and then, without warning, chase after you at high speed. You'll get hurt if they so much as come into contact with you, so be on your guard. As ghosts, they're immune to direct attacks. The only way to defeat them is to hit them with projectiles or items.''

==Trivia==
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Gastly's prototype name was "Spirit".
* Despite all of them being {{type|Poison}} Pokémon, Gastly and its [[List of Pokémon by evolutionary line|evolutionary line]] cannot learn any Poison-type moves by leveling up outside of [[Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!]] and [[Pokémon Legends: Arceus]].
* Gastly is tied with:
** {{p|Venipede}} for the lowest base {{stat|HP}} stat of all Poison-type Pokémon.
** {{p|Weedle}} for the lowest {{stat|Defense}} stat of all Poison-type Pokémon.
** {{p|Haunter}} for the [[List of Pokémon by weight|lightest]] Poison-type Pokémon.
** Haunter and {{form|Gimmighoul|Roaming Form}} {{p|Gimmighoul}} for the lightest {{type|Ghost}} Pokémon.
* Gastly is the only Pokémon that weighs exactly the same as its Evolution.

===Origin===
Gastly may be based on a cloud of poisonous gases; and a {{wp|hitodama}} or an {{wp|onibi}}, Japanese spirits similar to a {{wp|will-o'-the-wisp}}. Its evolutionary line appears to depict a ghost crossing from the afterlife into the living world, with Gastly representing one that has started to break through. This is further supported by {{p|Gengar}}'s forms being able to create portals to other dimensions and the afterlife.

Some of Gastly's traits, such as its {{t|Poison}} type and extremely light weight, could be based on {{jwp|浮遊霊|fuyūrei}}, floating spirits said to be able to spread diseases. Similarly, its Poison type and association with gases may be a reference to the {{wp|miasma theory}}, a belief that diseases were caused by toxic vapors. Notably, the scientific explanation for the aforementioned {{wp|atmospheric ghost lights}} often involves the oxidation of gases emitted in organic decay.

====Name origin====
