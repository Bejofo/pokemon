'''Zygarde''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ジガルデ''' ''Zygarde'') is a dual-type {{2t|Dragon|Ground}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation VI]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Zygarde has three [[#Form data|forms]]: '''10% Forme''', '''50% Forme''', and '''Complete Forme'''.

Additionally, there are two basic components of Zygarde: '''[[Zygarde Core]]s''', which act as the brains of Zygarde, and '''[[Zygarde Cell]]s''', which compose Zygarde's forms and are non-sentient. Neither Zygarde Cores nor Zygarde Cells can use [[move]]s or are useful in battles by themselves. They are stored inside a [[Zygarde Cube]].

Zygarde 50% Forme was introduced in {{g|X and Y}}. The Zygarde Cells, Zygarde Cores, Zygarde 10% Forme, and Zygarde Complete Forme were revealed in the October 2015 issue of [[CoroCoro]] magazine and later introduced in {{g|Sun and Moon}}.

A [[Squishy|Zygarde Core]] played an important role in {{aniseries|XY}} during the ''XY&Z'' arc.

Zygarde will play a prominent role in the upcoming [[Pokémon Legends: Z-A]].

Zygarde, {{p|Xerneas}}, and {{p|Yveltal}} are often collectively referred to as the [[Aura trio]] by fans.

==Biology==
Zygarde is a green and black {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} whose form depends on the percentage of [[Zygarde Core]]s and [[Zygarde Cell]]s it has assembled. Zygarde is responsible for monitoring the ecosystem of the [[Pokémon world]] for abnormalities, It has been referred to as a "guardian of the ecosystem"<ref>[[Legendary and Mythical Guidebook: Deluxe Edition]]: :''"It is said this Legendary Pokémon is a guardian of the ecosystem."''</ref> and "protector of the ecosystems"<ref>[https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/story-world/pokemon/zygarde50 Zygarde 50% Forme]</ref> due to this role. It also is capable of {{a|Aura Break|reversing}} the effects of {{p|Xerneas}}'s {{a|Fairy Aura}} and {{p|Yveltal}}'s {{a|Dark Aura}}, thus ensuring the equilibrium of the planet and the cycle of life and death are kept in check. It can also use its Cells in attacks, either shooting them as {{m|Thousand Arrows|arrows}} at its targets, or sending them crawling along the ground towards its targets as {{m|Thousand Waves|waves}}. It can also fire a {{m|Core Enforcer|powerful energy beam}} from its mouth at its targets, carving a Z on the ground in the process. Zygarde can fly in a blinding speed in all of its forms. Normally, Zygarde avoids getting involved in conflicts unless the ecosystem is in grave danger.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160219214237/http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/pokemon/legendary_pokemon/ | Zygarde (Archived)]</ref> As seen in the {{aniseries|XY}} episode ''[[XY131|Down to the Fiery Finish!]]'', Zygarde can summon and control massive roots, which it can use to attack and cover areas. In the same episode, the green color on Zygarde's body changed to red while under the influence of [[Team Flare]]'s [[Mega Evolution]] energy weapon. In the [[Pokémon Adventures]] manga and in {{aniseries|PTS}}, it has been referred to as "Z". In the anime, Zygarde is shown to be capable of [[Talking Pokémon|human speech]] via telepathy.

Zygarde is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the moves {{m|Land's Wrath}}, {{m|Thousand Arrows}}, {{m|Thousand Waves}}, and {{m|Core Enforcer}}. It is also the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Aura Break}} and {{a|Power Construct}} as its {{Abilities}}.

===Forms===
Zygarde has three forms: 10% Forme, 50% Forme, and Complete Forme, which are composed of [[Zygarde Core]]s and [[Zygarde Cell]]s.

[[File:Zygarde Core SM concept art.png|thumb|left|200px|[[Zygarde Core]]s serve as brains for Zygarde]]
Physically, a Zygarde Core and a Zygarde Cell are almost indistinguishable. Both are small, green cell-like blobs that resemble a {{wp|planarian}}. Their body can be segmented into three sections: a large, round head, an abdomen with a colored hexagon, and a stubby tail. They have two eyes, though one is larger and has a pupil, and can stand on their tail (a trait most associated with the Core). The difference between a Core and a Cell is subtle: a Core has a black pupil and a red hexagon on its abdomen, while these are both green on a Cell.
[[File:Zygarde Cells flying towards a Zygarde Core.png|right|thumb|250px|[[Zygarde Cell]]s flying towards a Zygarde Core]]
Zygarde Cores have wills of their own, while Cells do not, acting only in accordance to a Core's orders. In any form of Zygarde, the Cores act as brains. The Cells exist in much greater numbers than the Cores and tend to be scattered around the world. On their own, Cores and Cells do not have power to battle and need to be assembled in order to take action.<ref name=CoresCells>[http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/zygardes-cores-and-cells/ Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Zygarde's Cores and Cells] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20160814031551/http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/zygardes-cores-and-cells/ archive])</ref> A Zygarde may contain up to five Cores.

As depicted throughout {{aniseries|XY}}, Zygarde Cores and Zygarde Cells have the ability to turn invisible. Moreover, it revealed that a Core is able to watch over the ecosystem through the eyes of a Cell, can communicate telepathically with other Cores, and does not need to eat, instead absorbing sunlight for sustenance. As depicted in {{Aniseries|HZ}}, Cells are capable of transmitting what they see to anyone Zygarde wishes.

;10% Forme
[[File:Zygarde 10 Percent SM concept art.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The 10% Forme resembles a canine and has impressive speed]]
Zygarde 10% Forme is a relatively small {{wp|Canis|canine}} Pokémon. Its body is primarily black, though its neck, muzzle, mouth, eyebrows, and left front paw are green. Additionally, it has two green hexagons on its chest and a single one on its rear. From its neck, a green ribbon-like extension comes out, next to an elongated red hexagon, giving the impression of a leash and dog tag, respectively. Its eyes are white hexagons with no discernible pupils, and there is a thin white line on its forehead. Its mouth is fitted with razor-sharp fangs. On each of its legs are black hexagonal extensions: two on the back of each elbow, one behind each knee, and two on each hip. One of the hip extensions is longer than the other on each hip.

Zygarde 10% Forme is created when a single Zygarde Core combines with only a tenth of the total Cells.<ref>[https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/story-world/pokemon/zygarde10 10% Forme Zygarde]</ref> It is skilled at close range combat, overwhelming its opponents with its sharp fangs. It is also capable of running at speeds greater than 60 miles per hour (100 kilometers per hour). Since it has just one Core, it is able to act separately from Zygarde's 50% Forme, which comprises its main body, for a only short time before separating. Zygarde can wrap its "leash" around the arm of those it trusts, however, they can't remove it at will, which might cause them to be pulled when Zygarde runs. The 10% Forme is assumed in cases of emergency.<ref>[http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/zygarde-10-forme/ Pokémon Sun and Moon Site | Zygarde 10% Forme] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20160705143708/http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/zygarde-10-forme/ archive])</ref>
{{left clear}}

;50% Forme
Zygarde 50% Forme is a large {{wp|Snake|serpentine}} Pokémon. Most of its back, head, and neck are black, while the underbelly and the tip of its tail are green. Its eyes are made of four green hexagons, similar to an insect with {{wp|compound eye}}s, and there is a thin, white line down the center of its face. Across the back of its neck is a large frill made of five long, flat protrusions that each have two small, green hexagons on them. There are three short tendrils on either side of its chest; they are black on the right and green on the left. Its tail also ends in five tendrils. It has many small, green hexagon markings on its body capable of glowing.

Zygarde 50% Forme is assembled from half of its Cores and Cells reuniting. Despite being at only half of its possible total, its power is capable of overwhelming anyone who stands in its way. The 50% Forme is known to be both ruthless and merciless.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20171003202529mp_/http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/zygarde-50-forme/ | 50% Forme Zygarde] (Archived)</ref> There are rumors that even greater power lies hidden within it, being capable of {{A|Power Construct|changing}} to an even more powerful form when battling those who threaten the ecosystem.

;Complete Forme
[[File:Zygarde Complete SM concept art.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Zygarde Complete Forme's complex physiology]]
Zygarde Complete Form is a large humanoid Pokémon. There are several flat protrusions around its head and triangular protrusions around its neck. These protrusions create a crown shape. On its face are three white hexagonal marks: one in the middle of its forehead with a line through it and two that act as eyes. There are an additional five green hexagons on its face: four along the bottom and one in the middle of a short protrusion on top. Each shoulder has two serpentine wings protruding from it. The wings all have an undulating pattern and a hexagon near the tip: blue on the right side and red on the left. There are multiple white protrusions on its body: three on each hand acting as claws, one on each knee, and one and the front of each foot. Additionally, there are green hexagons surrounding its wrists and two under the white protrusions on its knees and feet. Its abdomen has a vertical, hexagonal pattern with a thin, white line on either side. Across its chest is a thin, zigzagging mouth that when opened, reveals five hexagons colored red, orange, white, cyan, and blue, respectively. It has a long tail similar to Zygarde 50% Forme's body.

Zygarde Complete Forme is created when 100% of its Cells and Cores are gathered. It is said to be Zygarde's perfected form and is specialized for battle, allowing it to fight at full power and complete its duty of protecting the Pokémon ecosystem. Zygarde Complete Forme uses this overwhelming power to suppress those who willingly endanger the ecosystem. Zygarde Complete Forme contains separate Cores for each of its wings and its tail. In this case, each Core can make decisions and act independently of the others.<ref>[http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/zygarde-complete-forme/ Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Zygarde Complete Forme] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20160705143718/http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/zygarde-complete-forme/ archive])</ref> The Zygarde Cores can freely change the shapes of the four wings and tail for a variety of roles. Notably in ''[[XY136|Forming a More Perfect Union!]]'', Zygarde is shown using the mouths of its tail and wings to attack with energy beams, propel itself, as well as restoring an unbalanced ecosystem back to normal. The zigzagging mouth on its chest can radiate enough high-powered energy to destroy everything around it, even firing energy beams from within it.<ref>[https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/story-world/pokemon/zygarde-complete Zygarde Complete Forme]</ref> This form only appears to neutralize huge threats to the ecosystem, such as [[Lysandre]]'s 50% Zygarde-like [[Giant Rock|construct]] and {{form|Necrozma|Ultra}} {{Adv|Necrozma}}. The Complete Forme is powerful enough to overwhelm even {{p|Xerneas}} and {{p|Yveltal}}.

===Form data===
Zygarde has three forms: 10% Forme, 50% Forme, and Complete Forme. [[Zygarde Cell]]s and [[Zygarde Core]]s also appear in the story of the [[Generation VII]] games, but they are not catchable Pokémon or registered in the Pokédex; they make up Zygarde's forms and are not forms themselves.

In [[Generation VI]], Zygarde's only form was 50% Forme (unnamed at the time).

Since [[Generation VII]], all three forms are available. Zygarde's 10% Forme and 50% Forme can be changed with the help of external tools: the [[Reassembly Unit]] and the Zygarde Cube. Zygarde can enter its Complete Forme during battle, and only if it has the Ability Power Construct.

The 10% Forme and 50% Forme of Zygarde can have the {{Abilities}} {{a|Aura Break}} or {{a|Power Construct}}. Internally, these are all separate forms. This makes it impossible to switch Zygarde's Ability with [[Ability Capsule]]s or [[Ability Patch]]es; the [[Reassembly Unit]] or the [[Zygarde Cube]] must be used instead.

;Zygarde with {{a|Aura Break}}
In [[Generation VI]], Zygarde could only have Aura Break and had no forms.

In [[Generation VII]], a Zygarde with Aura Break could be transformed by the [[Reassembly Unit]]. This machine could create a 10% or 50% Zygarde with Aura Break or upgrade a 10% Zygarde with Aura Break to 50%; it could also upgrade either to a 50% Zygarde with Power Construct.

Since [[Generation VIII]], the [[Zygarde Cube]]'s "Change form" function can change Zygarde with Aura Break between 10% Forme and 50% Forme. Its "Change Ability" function can also change its Ability to Power Construct.

;Zygarde with {{a|Power Construct}}
The [[Zygarde Cube]]'s "Change Forme"{{sup/7|SMUSUM}}/"Change form" function can change Zygarde with Power Construct between 10% Forme and 50% Forme. Since [[Generation VIII]], its "Change Ability" function can also change its Ability to Aura Break.

Any Zygarde with Power Construct will change to Complete Forme in battle if its [[HP]] drops below half. At the end of battle, a Complete Forme Zygarde will return to its original form with the same HP it ended the battle with (within its original form's maximum HP).

[[File:Z2 50 Percent Forme.png|thumb|250px|Zygarde 50% Forme in {{aniseries|XY}}]]
===Main series===
====Major appearances====
Zygarde is a major target of [[Team Flare]] in {{aniseries|XY}}. [[Zygarde Cell]]s and [[Zygarde Core|Cores]] debuted in ''[[XYS04|Mega Evolution Special IV]]''.

=====[[Squishy]]=====
With the help of [[Mairin]]'s {{p|Chespin}}, [[Chespie]], a Zygarde Core managed to escape [[Lysandre Labs]], and it subsequently came across {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}} in ''[[XY094|From A to Z!]]''. {{an|Bonnie}} was immediately taken with it and [[nickname]]d it "Squishy". It traveled in Bonnie's bag alongside {{TP|Clemont|Dedenne}}. In ''[[XY094|From A to Z!]]'', Squishy transformed into its 10% and 50% Formes to defend itself against [[Bryony]] and her subordinates, thus marking the debut of 10% Forme. In ''[[M19|Volcanion and the Mechanical Marvel]]'', when [[Alva]] used his laser weapon onto the [[Nebel Plateau]], it transformed into its Complete Forme to protect the it, thus marking the form's debut. Squishy is known by the code name '''Z1''' by Team Flare.

=====[[Z2]]=====
A Zygarde known by the code name '''Z2''' by Team Flare appeared as a 50% Forme Zygarde in ''[[XY094|From A to Z!]]''. It managed to escape Team Flare by using {{m|Land's Wrath}}. It appeared as a Zygarde Core during ''[[XY102|Meeting at Terminus Cave!]]'', being contacted by [[Squishy]]. It was captured by Team Flare and corrupted by their [[Mega Evolution]] weapon to help them clean the planet of humans. Unlike Squishy's red core, Z2 has a blue core.
[[File:White Zygarde 50 Percent Forme.png|thumb|250px|{{Shiny}} Zygarde 50% Forme in {{aniseries|HZ}}]]
=====[[White Zygarde]]=====
In ''[[HZ045|From So Far Away]]'', [[Gibeon]] is revealed to own a {{Shiny|White}} Zygarde, which was first seen in its 10% Forme. In a flashback in ''[[HZ075|The Wonders of the World!]]'', it was revealed that it actually used to be a 50% Forme Zygarde, but it lost that form when it attempted to sacrificed most of its [[Zygarde Cell]]s to seal the [[Laquium]] crystals away in [[Laqua]], to protect the {{pkmn|world}}'s ecosystem from it. In ''[[HZ087|Guided by the Black Rayquaza!]]'', it returned to Laqua alongside Gibeon, which allowed it to reunite with its Cells and regain its 50% Forme. In [[HZ088|the following episode]], it battled against [[Rising Volt Tacklers]] and [[Amethio]], but when it approved the group's strength, it forfeited the battle, disassembling into Cells and sadly abandoning Gibeon. A year after Gibeon passed away, in [[HZ092]], [[Hamber]] gave [[Zirc]] and [[Onia]] a [[Zygarde Cube]] and the mission to find and gather all of Zygarde's Cells.

=====Other=====
A Zygarde appeared in ''[[XYS05|The Legend of X, Y, and Z!]]'' during a flashback, where it was seen in its 50% Forme. When [[Veofum]] ordered his men to burn {{p|Xerneas}} after his plan to use its power failed, Zygarde appeared and destroyed his kingdom with {{m|Land's Wrath}}.

====Minor appearances====
Zygarde's Complete Forme's first appearance in the animated series was in ''[[XY098|Dream a Little Dream from Me!]]'', where it appeared in a dream.

A Zygarde appeared in its 50% Forme in the opening sequence of ''[[M19|Volcanion and the Mechanical Marvel]]''.

==In the manga==
[[File:Zygarde Adventures.png|thumb|250px|Zygarde 50% Forme in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===Pokémon Adventures===
{{main|Zygarde (Adventures)}}
Zygarde debuted in ''[[PS584|Hawlucha Attacks]]''. It first appeared in [[Anistar City]], where it was {{pkmn2|caught}} by [[Emma|Essentia]]. It was later used by her against [[Team Flare]]'s enemies at [[Pokémon Village]]. Eventually, she started to rebel, prompting [[Lysandre]] to take direct control of Zygarde. When [[Xerxer|Xerneas]] and {{p|Yveltal}} reverted to their dormant forms, Zygarde lost the need to keep itself active and disintegrated.

Zygarde also played a notable role in the {{MangaArc|Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon}}. Having been sent to [[Alola]] to find it, [[Dexio]] and [[Sina]] hired {{adv|Sun}} to gather the Zygarde Cells and Cores scattered around Alola. During the climax of the arc, Zygarde used the Reassembly Unit on {{rt|16|Alola}} to transform into its Complete Forme, before joining the battle against {{adv|Necrozma}} at [[Mount Lanakila]] alongside {{p|Solgaleo}} and {{p|Lunala}}.

*Zygarde is the only Pokémon that has two standard [[Ability|Abilities]] but does not have a [[Hidden Ability]].

===Origin===
Zygarde's 10%, 50%, and Complete Formes may be inspired in part by the three children of {{wp|Loki}} and {{wp|Angrboða}} in {{wp|Norse mythology}}: {{wp|Fenrir}}, {{wp|Jörmungandr}}, and {{wp|Hel (being)|Hel}}.

Zygarde 10% Forme may be based on the wolf Fenrir. The green leash-like object around its neck could be based on {{wp|Gleipnir}}, the rope that binds Fenrir. Its left front paw has a different color from the others, being green instead of black, which is possibly a reference to Fenrir biting off the god {{wp|Týr}}'s right hand in reprisal for being bound by him. This Forme could also draw inspiration from {{wp|Garmr}}, the watchdog that guards {{wp|Hel (location)|Helheim}}'s gate. In appearance, it resembles a {{wp|Dobermann|Doberman Pinscher}}.

Zygarde 50% Forme's appearance is based on a serpent in the shape of the letter Z. It may also draw inspiration from Jörmungandr, a sea serpent that encircles the earth; and {{wp|Níðhöggr}}, a dragon that gnaws at the roots of {{wp|Yggdrasil}}, the world tree. Jörmungandr is said to “dwell in the world sea, encircling the Earth (Midgard),” which may allude to  Zygarde's partial Ground typing (“Earth”) and the 50% Forme being the middle forme (“Midgard”). Its flat shape and wriggling movement may be inspired by the {{wp|tsuchinoko}}, a Japanese cryptid, and its snakelike appearance may be inspired by {{wp|nāga}}, a class of snake entities in South and Southeast Asian cultures.

Zygarde Complete Forme may be based on Hel, the ruler of {{wp|Helheim}}, the realm of the dead in Nordic myth. The colors on its Complete Forme's chest match the colors of the real-world {{wp|flag of France}}, the country which inspired the [[region]] of [[Kalos]]. These three colors match Kalos' pentagonal emblem that is split between three sections matching each section of Kalos' sub regions: blue on the left depicting Coastal Kalos, red on the right depicting Mountain Kalos, and white in the middle depicting central Kalos. The blue and red colors also match the colors of {{p|Xerneas}} and {{p|Yveltal}}. Design-wise, it resembles a humanoid {{wp|Mecha anime and manga|giant mecha}} despite its organic basis; its light-up technological appearance, "transforming"/"combining" gimmick, and the face-like pattern on its chest are all tropes commonly used for fictional mecha.

[[Zygarde Cell]]s and [[Zygarde Core]]s may be based on cells as well as {{wp|flatworm}}s (specifically {{wp|Planarian|planaria}}) and single-celled organisms such as {{wp|slime mold}}s and members of ''{{wp|Euglena}}''. Some planarians' {{wp|Simple eye in invertebrates#Ocelli|ocelli}} also resemble eyes, which may have inspired the designs for the Cell and Core Zygarde. The hexagons within them may represent a {{wp|cell nucleus}}.

====Name origin====
Zygarde begins with the letter {{wp|Z}}, following the pattern established by {{p|Xerneas}} and {{p|Yveltal}}. It may also be derived from ζυγωτός ''zygōtos'' (Greek for joined) or ''zygote'', ''garde'' (French for guard), and ''garðr'' (Old Norse for enclosure; realm).
