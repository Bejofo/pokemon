'''Farfetch'd''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''カモネギ''' ''Kamonegi'') is a dual-type {{2t|Normal|Flying}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

In [[Galar]], Farfetch'd has a {{type|Fighting}} [[regional form]]. Galarian Farfetch'd [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Sirfetch'd}} after landing three [[critical hit]]s in a single {{pkmn|battle}} (without running or losing). Kantonian Farfetch'd is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.

==Biology==
Farfetch'd is an avian {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that resembles a light brown duck with a white underbelly. It has a flat, yellow beak, brown eyes, a V-shaped black marking on its forehead (similar to a {{wp|unibrow}}), and a three-feather crest on top of its head. Its wings are as big as its body and appear to be {{wp|prehensility|prehensile}} enough to substitute for hands. It has yellow legs with webbed feet and a stubby tail.

Farfetch'd is always seen carrying a leek stalk or spring onion. It carries this sprig in its wings, but sometimes chooses to hold it in its beak or feet instead. Unable to live without its stick, Farfetch'd will defend it with its life. Losing the stalk can leave Farfetch'd defenseless, and it will seek out a new one to replace it. Known uses for the stick include use as a weapon, nesting material, and emergency food source. When using the stalk to attack, Farfetch'd wields and uses it like a sword to cut through things. There are several different fighting styles involving Farfetch'd's leek. It is selective about which sticks it will use and has been known to fight over good ones. As mentioned in [[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]], Farfetch'd will always hold onto its stalk, even when sleeping on its back in a defenseless position. Farfetch'd has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: ''Sprawled Sleep'', ''Plant-Stalk-at-the-Ready Sleep'', ''Plant-Stalk-Nibbling Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''.

Farfetch'd is found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|temperate grasslands}} where reedy plants grow, guarding the plants from anyone trying to disturb them. However, Farfetch'd is rarely seen, and thus it is thought that its numbers are decreasing, and that it is at risk of extinction. According to sources such as ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' and the [[Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia]], its population decline is caused by {{DL|Pokémon predation|Humans eating Pokémon|humans who hunted it down for food}}; one popular recipe suggested cooking it with its own leek. There have been attempts at {{pkmn|breeding}} in order to increase the Farfetch'd population. In the [[Pikachu short]] ''[[PK01|Pikachu's Vacation]]'', Farfetch'd are shown to be able to swim like real-life ducks.

Farfetch'd and {{p|Sirfetch'd}} are the only known Pokémon capable of using the [[Leek]] item.

===Forms===
Farfetch'd has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Galarian}} Farfetch'd.

In [[Galar]], Farfetch'd is a deeper shade of brown, with a more prominent black mark on its head and a much more unfriendly look on its face. The leek it carries with its wings is much larger in Galar than the leeks that Farfetch'd use in other regions, although whether it is related to the [[Large Leek]] used as a [[curry]] ingredient is unknown. 

Galarian Farfetch'd's body has developed a much stronger frame that gives it the strength required to carry its leek. However, this sheer mass makes it hard for it to fly. It is renowned for its courage in battle and can use its leek like swords or javelins. As a result of surviving and experiencing many different battles, Galarian Farfetch'd develops the ability to evolve into {{p|Sirfetch'd}}.

===Evolution===
{{rf|Galarian}} Farfetch'd evolves into {{p|Sirfetch'd}}. Kantonian Farfetch'd is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon.

===NPC appearances===
* {{3v2|Gold|Silver|Crystal}}: The charcoal makers of [[Azalea Town]] own a Farfetch'd. However, it won't listen to the apprentice and runs off in the [[Ilex Forest]]. Herding it back to him earns the player an {{HM|01|Cut}}.
* [[Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon]]: Farfetch'd is one of the teachers at the school in [[Serene Village]]. He is serious about what he does, but his lessons are frequently interrupted. During summer vacation, he goes missing due to some mischievous {{p|Litwick|ghosts}}, but he is returned without being harmed.

=====Galarian Farfetch'd=====
Galarian Farfetch'd transferred from [[Pokémon GO]] to [[Pokémon HOME]] from November 11 to November 16, 2020 erroneously use the level-up learnset of their Kantonian counterpart from [[Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!]]. Galarian Farfetch'd or Sirfetch'd in Pokémon HOME, Sword, or Shield with illegal moves had their moves replaced with moves from their level-up movepool on November 16, 2020; opening Pokémon HOME at any point after that date will cause HOME to search all Sword and Shield savefiles on the console and correct the illegal movesets.

Players who transferred a Galarian Farfetch'd with any of these illegal moves cannot trade or battle online with it unless that move is deleted. These erroneous Galarian Farfetch'd otherwise function like other Galarian Farfetch'd, with Galarian Farfetch'd from GO being able to evolve into a Sirfetch'd with an illegal moveset.

==Trivia==
[[File:Spr 2d 228.png|thumb|Sprite of Madāmu from 1997 demo]]
* In the [[Pokémon Gold and Silver Spaceworld '97 demo|1997 Nintendo Space World demo]] of {{game|Gold and Silver|s}}, Farfetch'd had an [[Evolution]], known as マダーム ''Madāmu'', that was scrapped in the final release of the games.
** {{g|Sword and Shield}} director [[Shigeru Ohmori]] has stated in an interview that {{p|Sirfetch'd}}'s design is not inspired by this scrapped Evolution, but is instead a new one fitting for the [[Galar]] region, which is based on the {{wp|United Kingdom}}.<ref>Tapsell, Chris (October 24, 2019). "[https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-sword-and-shield-junichi-masuda-shigeru-ohmori-interview Game Freak's Junichi Masuda and Shigeru Ohmori talk inspiration, Sirfetch'd, and pressure from Pokémon fans]." ''Eurogamer''.</ref>
* Farfetch'd and Sirfetch'd are the only Pokémon with an apostrophe in their names.
** Due to this, it is impossible to return a [[nickname]]d Farfetch'd to its species name in the English, Spanish, or Italian versions of the [[Generation I]] and {{gen|II}} games. This is because the apostrophe is not available as a character for nicknames.
** Due to a bug in {{g|HOME}}, an unnicknamed Farfetch'd or Sirfetch'd with an English, Spanish, or Italian [[language of origin]] that is transferred into HOME will be treated as a nicknamed Pokémon, due to HOME assigning a different character for the apostrophe in the species names ("Farfetch’d" and "Sirfetch’d").
* Farfetch'd is the only Pokémon with a base stat total of 377. Prior to the Attack increase it received in [[Pokémon X and Y]], it was instead the only Pokémon with a base stat total of 352.
* Due to changes to the critical-hit formula in [[Generation VI]], if Farfetch'd holds its signature item, the [[Leek]], and uses a move with an increased critical-hit ratio, the move will always land as a critical hit.
* In {{game|Emerald}}, Farfetch'd can learn {{m|Fury Cutter}} via leveling up, but not via [[Move Tutor]]. This was fixed in {{v2|Platinum}}.
* Galarian Farfetch'd can be seen as a parallel to Galarian {{p|Corsola}}. They are both [[regional form]]s with a single type and can evolve once, while their original forms do not evolve. At the [[Stow-on-Side Stadium]] and during the [[Champion Cup]] Finals, [[Bea]] in Pokémon Sword uses Galarian Farfetch'd's Evolution, Sirfetch'd, in her team, while [[Allister]] in Pokémon Shield uses Galarian Corsola's Evolution, {{p|Cursola}}, in his team.
* Galarian Farfetch'd was released in [[Pokémon GO]] on June 17, 2020, shortly after Galarian {{p|Meowth}} and {{p|Zigzagoon}}. Although the latter two could evolve into {{p|Perrserker}} and {{p|Obstagoon}} upon release, respectively, Galarian Farfetch'd couldn't evolve into Sirfetch'd at the time. Sirfetch'd was later added to coincide with the release of [[The Crown Tundra]] for the [[Pokémon Sword and Shield Expansion Pass]] on October 22, 2020.
* {{pkmn2|Wild}} Galarian Farfetch'd will not evolve if they land three critical hits on the player's Pokémon and are then caught.<ref>https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/sword-shield-battle-mechanics-research.3655528/page-64#post-9207497</ref>

===Origin===
{{Bulbanews|On the Origin of Species: Farfetch'd}}
Farfetch'd seems to be based on a {{wp|duck}}. It may be inspired by the Japanese saying 「{{tt|鴨が葱を背負って来る|Kamo ga negi wo shotte kuru}}」, literally translating to "a duck comes bearing {{wp|Welsh onion|spring onions}}". As a saying, it means "easy target" or "golden opportunity". The phrase can be shortened to 「{{tt|鴨葱|Kamo negi}}」, which is transliterated the same as Farfetch'd's Japanese name (Kamonegi).

{{rf|Galarian}} Farfetch'd was inspired by leeks in the United Kingdom growing larger and thicker than leeks in Japan.<ref>[https://www.polygon.com/interviews/2019/10/24/20929597/game-freak-explains-the-1000-staff-missing-creatures-and-leek-size-of-pokemon-sword-and-shield Game Freak explains the 1,000 staff, missing creatures, and leek size of Pokémon Sword and Shield] - Polygon</ref> The leek it carries resembles the Giant Musselburgh, a larger variant of the spring onion that was first bred in {{wp|Scotland}}, and the {{wp|wild leek}}, one of the {{wp|National symbols of Wales|national symbols}} of {{wp|Wales}}. Galarian Farfetch'd itself may be inspired by a {{wp|hammer throw}} athlete given the way it wields its leek, such as swinging it in a circular motion during its attacks. It may also be based on a {{wp|javelin throw}}er. Its serious disposition and how it holds its leek over its shoulder is typical of the lone {{wp|samurai}} archetype in modern Japanese fiction; the leek thus could be a stand-in for the {{wp|ōdachi}}, which are large traditional Japanese swords such that samurai carrying them had to haul them over their backs.

====Name origin====
Farfetch'd may be derived from ''far-fetched'', meaning ''unbelievable'', perhaps relating to Farfetch'd's rarity or the "far-fetched" theme of its Japanese name.

Kamonegi may be a combination of 鴨 ''kamo'' (duck) and 葱 ''negi'' ({{wp|Welsh onion|spring onion}}) that forms the expression 鴨葱 ''kamo negi'', an abbreviation of the proverb 「鴨が葱を背負って来る」 ''kamo ga negi o shottekuru'' (literally "a duck comes bearing spring onions") that means "easy target" or "golden opportunity".
