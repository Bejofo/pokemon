'''Hoopa''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''フーパ''' ''Hoopa'') is a dual-type {{2t|Psychic|Ghost}} [[Mythical Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation VI]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Hoopa has an alternate [[#Form data|form]], which it changes into by using the [[Prison Bottle]]. Its default form, '''Hoopa Confined''', will then become the dual-type {{2t|Psychic|Dark}} '''Hoopa Unbound'''. In Generation VI and [[Generation VII|VII]], Hoopa Unbound will revert into Hoopa Confined while in the player's [[party]] if three days have passed since changing to Hoopa Unbound. Other circumstances may also cause it to revert.

(Refer to [[#Form data|Game data&rarr;Form data]] for more details.)

Hoopa Confined was officially revealed in the February 2015 issue of [[CoroCoro]] magazine, whereas Hoopa Unbound was revealed by CoroCoro three months later.

Hoopa will have an upcoming role in the [[Pokémon Legends: Z-A]] DLC [[Mega Dimension]].

==Biology==
[[File:M18 Promo Artwork 5.png|250px|thumb|left|Hoopa summoning multiple [[Legendary Pokémon]] through its hoop]]
Hoopa Confined is a light-purple {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a vaguely humanoid appearance. It has green eyes with yellow sclerae, a yellow ring marking on its forehead, a small, pink dot under each eye, and dark pink hair tied into a short ponytail. On either side of its head is a dark gray horn that curves slightly upward. Its body has a dark pink, V-shaped marking on the chest and a small, golden spike on each shoulder. Its arms are not attached to its body and instead float next to it; each arm has a small golden spike similar to those on its shoulders. It has mitten-like hands and dark pink rings around each wrist. In place of actual legs, it has a wispy tail. Hoopa has three gold rings: a large one around its waist and one hanging freely on each of its horns.

In the past, Hoopa's true power is said to have been sealed away in the [[Prison Bottle]] for the destruction it used to cause, reducing Hoopa to its smaller, weaker form; opening the bottle grants Hoopa its true form once again, but only for three days. In ''[[M18|Hoopa and the Clash of Ages]]'', the one who sealed {{an|Hoopa}}'s power in the Prison Bottle was a traveler named [[Ghris]]. The rings on Hoopa's body can warp space and allow it to transport items, [[human]]s, and {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} by passing them through its hoops. This power allows it to cause mischief and take anything it wants. Hoopa is connected to many strange events because of these mysterious powers. It stores all of its gathered loot in a secret spot only it knows. Hoopa is said to have the power to bend dimensions. It is heavily implied to be the one causing many of the [[Mirage spot]]s in the [[Hoenn]] [[region]]. As seen in {{g|Masters EX}}, Hoopa can even bring people and Pokémon from {{pkmn|multiverse|alternate timelines}}. Hoopa is very fond of foods that have holes in them, especially donuts.<ref name=ZAsite>(September 12, 2025). [https://legends.pokemon.com/en-gb/news/mega-dimension-hoopa The Mythical Pokémon Hoopa Holds the Key to the Story] — Pokémon Official Website</ref>

Hoopa's lair is rumored to be located inside an hidden desert oasis. This lair contains many objects and treasures Hoopa obtained over the years, claiming as its own. Hoopa's lair is believed to contain mountains of gold and silver treasures it stole from ancient kings and wealthy land barons. To the present day, no one has ever found Hoopa's lair due to how well hidden it is. Hoopa can be very vengeful to those who attempt to manipulate it for its unique power. According to one tale, it punished an organization by transporting their individual objects before moving their headquarter to the middle of the desert. This incident terrified the organization to the point of disbanding.

Hoopa Confined is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Hyperspace Hole}}.

===Forms===
[[File:Hoopa Hole ORAS.png|thumb|right|A ring [[Mirage spot]] in {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}]]
Hoopa has two forms: Hoopa Confined and Hoopa Unbound. 

Hoopa Unbound is a large, bipedal Pokémon with six arms. It is mostly light blue with purple hair. The ponytail on its head is larger and bushier and held in place by two golden rings. Its hair now covers its chin, where it forms a pointed beard, and the back of its neck. The horns are less curved and have spiky purple hair around the bases. There are three gold rings on each horn: two around the base and one around the middle. It has yellow eyes white sclerae, a pointed, dark gray nose, a small hole inside of the ring-marking on its forehead, and prominent fangs in the back of its lower jaw. Similar to Hoopa Confined, its arms are disconnected and float next to its body. Instead of a small, gold spike the arms now have large, dark gray spikes and appear from holes along the sides of its body. Each arm has three fingers with dark gray claws, a gold ring around the wrist, and a gold ring around the base. Several tufts of purple hair surround its torso and a gold ring encircles a hole in the center of its chest. Another large gold ring encircles its waist and there are small tufts of hair poking out from underneath it. There is a purple stripe that widens at the knee down each leg and two gold rings around each ankle. The tips of its feet are gold and curl upward, resembling shoes. Additionally, this form has a tail with a purple stripe along the top and an arrow-shaped tip. Hoopa Unbound is tied with {{me|Gyarados}} as the tallest {{t|Dark}} type.

Hoopa Unbound is said to be Hoopa's true form and is said to have a humongous amount of power. Hoopa is at full power in its Unbound Form, it can increase the size of its six rings to grow multiple miles in length. These massive rings are capable of transporting entire islands through its hoops. Hoopa Unbound is capable of bending dimensions on an even more powerful scale.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20160221061908/http://www.pokemonrubysapphire.com/en-us/pokemon/hoopa</ref> Hoopa Unbound can summon powerful [[Legendary Pokémon]] through its hoops. It can even use its rage to drive Legendary Pokémon berserk. However, this has the dangerous side effect of creating a space-time distortion that'll destroy the area where they were summoned as depicted in ''[[M18|Hoopa and the Clash of Ages]]''. One legend stated that it greedily teleported an entire castle from [[Kalos]] 3,000 years ago to obtain a treasure hidden within it. Hoopa can remain in its Unbound form for only three days, until its power is sealed back into the Prison Bottle, reverting itself to its Confined Form.

Hoopa Unbound is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning and using the move {{m|Hyperspace Fury}}.

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
* {{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}}: Hoopa appears as a special non-recruitable ally. He is the genie of the [[Djinn's Bottle]] found in [[Sahra Town]], and will "[[Connection Orb|connect]]" with the {{player}}'s team upon finding it for the first time. If the player has the Djinn's Bottle in their bag, they may summon him during an expedition in one of his two forms, chosen at random, and may also request he use his rings to randomly summon either a connected {{pkmn2|Legendary}} or [[Mythical Pokémon]] as an ally for that floor only, a group of wild Pokémon that can appear on that floor, or nothing at all.

===Form data===
Hoopa has two forms it can change between using the [[Prison Bottle]]: Hoopa Confined and Hoopa Unbound

Hoopa Confined is Hoopa's default form, which is {{2t|Psychic|Ghost}}-type. When exposed to a Prison Bottle, Hoopa Confined transforms into Hoopa Unbound, which is {{2t|Psychic|Dark}}-type. Hoopa Unbound was introduced in {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}.

Hoopa Unbound will change back into Hoopa Confined after three days have passed since using the Prison Bottle. Hoopa also changes back to Hoopa Confined when deposited in a [[Pokémon Storage System|Box]] ([[Generation VI]]), when withdrawn from a box ([[Generation VII]]), when deposited in the [[Pokémon Day Care]] or [[Pokémon Nursery]], or when exposed to the Prison Bottle again.

The two forms have different [[base stats]], [[type]]s, [[move]]s they can learn, and [[cry|cries]]. Additionally, the move {{m|Hyperspace Fury}} is usable only by Hoopa Unbound (or a Pokémon that has transformed into Hoopa Unbound with {{m|Transform}} or {{a|Imposter}}), and will fail if Hoopa Confined (or any other Pokémon) attempts to use it. In [[Generation IX]], when Hoopa becomes Hoopa Unbound, {{m|Hyperspace Hole}} is replaced with Hyperspace Fury and vice versa.

==Trivia==
* Hoopa Unbound has the highest base {{stat|Special Attack}} stat of all {{type|Dark}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}.
* Hoopa Unbound is tied with {{me|Gyarados}} for being the [[List of Pokémon by height|tallest]] {{type|Dark}} Pokémon.
** It is also the tallest and [[List of Pokémon by weight|heaviest]] [[Mythical Pokémon]].
* Hoopa is the only [[Generation VI]] Pokémon to have different [[Pokédex entry|Pokédex entries]] between {{g|X and Y}} and {{pkmn|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}.
* Hoopa Unbound is the only Pokémon with a {{cat|Pokémon with a base stat total of 680|base stat total of 680}} that is not a [[Legendary Pokémon]].
* In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, the "mysterious rings" in [[mirage spot]]s, from which Pokémon jump out when interacted with, resemble rings used by Hoopa.

===Origin===
Hoopa Confined may have been inspired by common depictions of {{wp|jinn|djinn}}. The rings around its wrists could have been inspired by the djinn in the story of {{wp|Aladdin}}.

Hoopa Unbound could be specifically inspired by {{wp|Ifrit}}, powerful djinn or {{wp|demon}}s, which are often depicted as malicious, or {{wp|Marid}}, evil djinn or {{wp|devil}}s, which according to some stories do the exact opposite of what they are commanded to do. Its six arms may be drawn from certain {{wp|Hindu deities}}, who were often depicted with multiple arms. It may also be based on the {{wp|Gegenees}}, who were a tribe of six-armed giants who fought the {{wp|Argonauts}} in {{wp|Greek mythology}}. Its tail and horns may also derive from common depictions of demons, the circle motif thus may be inspired by {{wp|magic circle|summoning circles}}.

Hoopa's relationship with the [[Prison Bottle]] is similar to the djinn's with its lamp in traditional Arabian stories, since its full power is sealed within its respective vessel. Hoopa only being able to maintain its Unbound state for three days parallels the limit to the number of wishes a djinn can grant to its current master.

Both forms of Hoopa could also be partly based on the legend of {{wp|Nezha}}, a deity worshiped in {{wp|Taoism}} and {{wp|Chinese folk religion}} and commonly referred to as a childish trickster deity and a worldly protector. Very much like Hoopa Unbound, Nezha is depicted holding rings and is sometimes depicted with multiple arms.

Hoopa's power may have been inspired by the Single Horned Rhinoceros King, a character in the classic Chinese novel ''{{wp|Journey to the West}}'' who wielded a golden jade ring that had the power to suck in anything. The true form of the Single Horned Rhinoceros King is also revealed to be a heavenly azure bull, which may be referenced by Hoopa's bull-like horns.

====Name origin====
Hoopa may be derived from ''hoop''. It may also involve ''hoopla'' (something loud, attention-grabbing, and possibly misleading); or ''OOPArt'' ({{wp|out-of-place artifact}}).
