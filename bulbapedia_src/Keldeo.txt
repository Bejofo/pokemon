'''Keldeo''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ケルディオ''' ''Keldeo'') is a dual-type {{2t|Water|Fighting}} [[ Mythical Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation V]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any Pokémon, Keldeo has a second [[#Form data|form]]. When it knows the move {{m|Secret Sword}}, it changes from its original form, '''Ordinary Form''', to its '''Resolute Form'''.

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Form data|Game data&rarr;Form data]] for these details.)

Keldeo was {{n|Keldeo to be revealed in upcoming CoroCoro|leaked}} on a photo of a page from [[CoroCoro]] magazine on February 13, 2012, and it was officially revealed on [http://www.pokemon.co.jp/info/2012/02/120215_g01.html?a001=news February 15, 2012]. Its Resolute Form was officially revealed on June 13, 2012, and debuted in {{B2W2}}.

Along with {{p|Cobalion}}, {{p|Terrakion}}, and {{p|Virizion}}, Keldeo is a member of the [[Swords of Justice]]. In the {{pkmn|movie}} ''[[M15|Kyurem VS. The Sword of Justice]]'', they are also associated with {{p|Kyurem}}.

==Biology==
Keldeo is a quadrupedal, colt-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a cream-colored body. It has a short, rounded snout with large nostrils and blue eyes. It has a large, feathery red mane, long, dark blue, ridged eyebrow-like protrusions, and a single cream-colored horn that curves slightly. The back of its head, as well as its neck, is covered with fluffy, light blue fur. Keldeo has blue hooves placed backwards, which are capable of ejecting water. Its tail is light blue with white spots and resembles an elaborate feather in a cap.

Long ago, a fire started in the [[Moor of Icirrus]] because of a war between the [[human]]s. In this fire, Keldeo was separated from its parents, but the three [[Swords of Justice]]: {{p|Cobalion}}, {{p|Terrakion}}, and {{p|Virizion}} adopted and took care of Keldeo as one of their own. They acted as its parents, and they taught it knowledge and techniques for survival. Keldeo eventually grew and even surpassed its mentors. One day, Keldeo took off from the forest with no one knowing why. When the four met again in the Moor of Icirrus, they taught Keldeo the move {{m|Secret Sword}}. When Keldeo left, it started crossing the {{pkmn|world}} and often appeared at beautiful watersides. Keldeo possesses remarkable speed and travels in order to further improve itself through training. Like {{p|Suicune}}, Keldeo can also walk across the water by ejecting water from its hooves.

In [[Generation V]], {{m|Sacred Sword}} was one of its [[signature move]]s. Keldeo is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Secret Sword}}.

===Forms===
Keldeo has two forms: Ordinary Form and Resolute Form.

Upon being taught the move {{m|Secret Sword}} by its [[Swords of Justice|former mentors]], Keldeo has its resolve for battle strengthened, filling its body with power, thus transforming from its Ordinary Form into its Resolute Form. 

The dark blue protrusions on its head become shorter and lighter in color, now resembling ears. Its horn becomes dark blue and grows larger and ridged. On the side of its head are three feathers colored aqua blue, green, and orange.

Keldeo is at its full power when in Resolute Form. It is thought that when Keldeo becomes resolute, its body fills with power and its agility increases further. Keldeo's jumping capabilities become fast to the point where it is hard to follow. The horn on its forehead is filled with hidden power, and can manifest a {{m|Secret Sword|sword}} that can cut through anything. It is said Keldeo must endure harsh battles in order for the forehead horn to develop, which then awakens this true power.

===NPC appearance===
{{spoilers}}
* [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Gates to Infinity]]: {{mdc|Keldeo|gti}} is an important character in the storyline. He was once a friend of {{mdc|Virizion|gti}}, and a [[Magnagate]] savant. He was imprisoned in [[Glacier Palace]], and there he wrote a letter to Virizion, telling her that they weren't friends anymore. This letter caused Virizion to stop believing in friends. After being rescued by {{mdc|Umbreon and Espeon|gti}}, he apologizes to Virizion for writing the letter. He joins the player's team after the player returns to the human world.

===Form data===
Keldeo has two interchangeable forms: Ordinary Form and Resolute Form. These forms are mostly cosmetic. The Resolute Form was introduced in {{B2W2}}.

If Keldeo is taught {{m|Secret Sword}}, it will change into its Resolute Form. If it forgets Secret Sword, it returns to its Ordinary Form. Keldeo knowing Secret Sword in {{game|Black and White|s}} remain in its Ordinary Form when [[trade]]d or [[transfer]]red to later games, though in {{g|Sword and Shield}}, an Ordinary Form Keldeo that knows Secret Sword will change to Resolute Form if it is in the [[party]] at the end of a {{pkmn|battle}}, or upon learning or forgetting any [[move]] other than Secret Sword.

In addition, Resolute Form Keldeo knowing Secret Sword in {{B2W2}} cannot be traded to Pokémon Black and White as there is no data for the form in those games. In order to be transferred to Pokémon Black and White, Keldeo must forget Secret Sword.

In {{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}}, Keldeo can select its Resolute Form at the start of a dungeon if it knows Secret Sword.

'''PAL''': ''The Mythical Pokémon Keldeo looks a lot like a multicoloured unicorn. In its Resolute Form, its horn grows longer and its vision improves.

==Trivia==
[[File:Keldeo event art.png|thumb|220px|Keldeo in its Ordinary Form]]
* As the fourth member of the [[Swords of Justice]], Keldeo shares several traits with them, but is somewhat different in a number of ways:
** Unlike the others, Keldeo can't learn {{m|Quick Attack}}. Instead, it can learn {{m|Aqua Jet}}, a [[move variations|variation]] of Quick Attack.
** The moves that Keldeo learns by level have higher base powers than the moves learned by the other Swords of Justice.
** Prior to [[Generation VIII]], Keldeo learned {{m|Sacred Sword}} at a higher level than the others.
** Its legs seem to be stylized after animal legs and hooves, unlike the others, which seem to have boots.
** Keldeo isn't listed near the other three in [[National Pokédex]] order.
** Keldeo's name doesn't end with -ion.
** Keldeo is a Mythical Pokémon, and not a Legendary.
** Keldeo does not have a [[Paradox Pokémon]] counterpart.
* Keldeo, along with {{p|Meloetta}}, are the only [[Mythical Pokémon]] to learn their [[signature move]]s from an external source.
* Keldeo shares its trait of running across water with {{p|Suicune}}, another quadrupedal {{type|Water}} Pokémon.
* Keldeo is the lightest and smallest of the Swords of Justice.
* Keldeo's {{stat|Attack}} and {{stat|Special Attack}} stats are the reverse of {{p|Terrakion}}'s, while their other stats are identical.

===Origin===
Keldeo is most likely based on the {{wp|Scotland|Scottish}} legend of the {{wp|kelpie}}, a supernatural water horse that sometimes appeared as a lost pony. This is evidenced by the fact that Keldeo appears in the [[Crown Tundra]], an area based on Scotland. Keldeo is also likely based on the {{wp|Qilin|kirin}}, also referred to as the "Chinese {{wp|unicorn}}", which are often depicted with a single backward curving horn and the ability to walk on water.

Story-wise, as the rest of the [[Swords of Justice]] draw inspiration from the main characters of ''{{wp|The Three Musketeers}}'', Keldeo may draw inspiration from the character of {{wp|d'Artagnan}} from the novel. Like d'Artagnan, Keldeo is the latest and youngest addition to the group. Keldeo's tail also resembles d'Artagnan's trademark feathered cap.

The three feathers on Resolute Form Keldeo's head may symbolize its three companions and teachers: blue for {{p|Cobalion}}, yellow for {{p|Terrakion}}, and green for {{p|Virizion}}.

====Name origin====
Keldeo may be a combination of ''{{wp|kelpie}}'' (a water horse from Celtic folklore), ''kelda'' ({{wp|Old Norse}} for well or spring), and ''{{wp|rodeo}}'' (a sport involving skills with horses, cows, and other livestock). It may also involve ''dio'' (Italian for god).
