'''Minior''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''メテノ''' ''Meteno'') is a dual-type {{2t|Rock|Flying}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation VII]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Minior can {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Minior|change forms}} during battle, due to its {{a|Shields Down}} [[Ability]], depending on its current [[HP]]. When Minior's HP is below half, it changes from '''Meteor Form''' to a form where its core is exposed. Exposed core Minior will revert back to Meteor Form if its HP is restored above 50%.

Minior's exposed core can be one of seven colors, which are non-interchangeable and correspond to the colors of a {{wp|rainbow}}. These forms are '''Red Core''', '''Orange Core''', '''Yellow Core''', '''Green Core''', '''Blue Core''', '''Indigo Core''', and '''Violet Core'''.

==Biology==
[[File:Pokémon HOME Wallpaper Minior.png|thumb|150px|left|Minior's  seven colored cores in a wallpaper for Pokémon HOME]]
Minior is a spherical {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with two forms: one form with a rocky outer coating and the other with its core exposed. When it sheds its rocky coating, its exposed core form is both the [[List of Pokémon by weight|lightest]] {{type|Rock}} and {{type|Flying}} Pokémon. Both of its forms tie with {{p|Carbink}} and {{p|Dwebble}} as the [[List of Pokémon by height|shortest]] {{type|Rock}}.

In its Meteor Form, Minior resembles a modestly sized rock. Its rocky exterior is formed by four large plates separated by two large cracks. The cracks encircle its body both horizontally and vertically. Five white spikes extend just above the rocky surface, giving it a star shape. Two large, black spots on its front resemble eyes, and there is a third spot in the center of its back. Rings of dark brown triangles surround the holes its spikes protrude from and the spot on its back, pointing outward. One of the triangles surrounding the spot on its back is replaced with a small, brown dot. The eyespots have a half-ring of triangles resembling eyelashes. One eye has a small, brown dot in the corner. Even while apparently at rest, Minior tends to spin slowly in place.

When its core is exposed, Minior loses its rocky shell. The core is a bright, pastel color. Depending on the color of debris and food it absorbed and ate while in the stratosphere, Minior's core can be Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, or Violet. A handful of darker triangles are also visible on its body in random places. Minior's eyes and mouth are formed from energy that floats in front of its body like a two-dimensional mask. The eyes are two large swirls and the mouth is a smaller line. Its face tends to stay level regardless of how Minior spins the rest of its body. The colors of Minior's forms are determined by the composition of the dust it consumes.

Minior forms in the {{wp|stratosphere}} from an aggregation of mutated nanoparticles, where it absorbs particulate matter from which it builds its core and shell. When touched in Meteor Form, Minior will react when touched or called to, it is unknown if these responses indicate its consciousness. Eventually, this process makes it too heavy and it falls towards the surface of the planet. When its shell breaks from landing, Minior becomes lighter and capable of attacking quickly. However, it cannot survive for long with its core exposed, and will eventually die if not placed inside a [[Poké Ball]] quickly enough. Despite this, many fallen Minior will attempt to return to space, sadly being unable to return to space. Despite their wish to return home, all they can do is fade away without their shells. The cute, pastel coloring of Minior's core often inspires designers to use it as a motif for clothing and accessories.<ref>[http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/minior/ Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Minior]</ref> While in the ozone layer, it serves as food to stronger Pokémon such as {{p|Rayquaza}}. Minior's diet consists of eating dust. Places where Minior falls are few, [[Alola]] being one of them.

Minior is the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Shields Down}} as an [[Ability]].

===Forms===
[[File:Minior SM concept art.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Minior's shell is broken off when it gets too heavy, exposing its core]]
Minior has two forms: Meteor Form and the seven colored forms for its core that are otherwise identical.

The color of Minior’s core changes color depending on which color it has absorbed from debris. All Minior have the same Meteor Form regardless of the color of its exposed core, which can be any of seven colors corresponding to the colors of a {{wp|rainbow}}. The color of a Minior's core cannot be changed.

===Form data===
Minior has two forms: Meteor Form and the seven colored forms for its core that are otherwise identical. It changes between them with its [[Ability]] {{a|Shields Down}}. It will always have its core exposed outside of {{pkmn|battle}}. In battle, {{pkmn2|wild}} Minior start in Meteor Form, while other Minior start with their core exposed but are immediately transformed into Meteor Form by Shields Down after being sent out. If Meteor Form Minior's {{stat|HP}} is at or below 50% of its maximum HP at the end of a turn, its shell breaks and it has its core exposed. It changes back into Meteor Form at the end of a turn if its HP is above 50% of its maximum HP.

|sprite2=0774Minior-Core

}}

Minior has different stats based on whether it is in Meteor Form or if its core is exposed. Meteor Form Minior has higher {{stat|Defense}} and {{stat|Special Defense}}, while exposed core Minior has higher Attack, Special Attack, and Speed. Due to its Ability Shields Down, Meteor Form Minior cannot be afflicted by [[status condition]]s or become drowsy due to {{m|Yawn}}.

Minior's core can be one of seven different colors, each corresponding to one of the colors of a {{wp|rainbow}}. These forms are purely cosmetic and are non-interchangeable. [[Pokémon breeding|Bred]] Minior will always have the same color as their parent. In [[Generation VII]], and also in the [[Nintendo Switch]] version of {{g|HOME}}, all colors of Minior's core share the exact same {{Shiny}} appearance.

==Trivia==
* Minior was designed by [[Hitoshi Ariga]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/ariga_megamix/status/804500572967555072 Tweet by ありがひとし/ArigaHitoshi (@ariga_megamix).] Posted on December 2, 2016.</ref>
** The concept of Minior came from [[Masafumi Nukita]], which also involved writing their [[Pokédex entry|Pokédex entries]].<ref>https://archive.is/tS5lL</ref>
* Prior to the release of {{g|HOME}}, Minior was tied with {{p|Alcremie}} as being under the most [[Pokédex]] [[List of Pokémon by color|color]] groupings, with a total of six. The distinction is now held by {{p|Vivillon}}, with nine Pokédex color groupings.
* Minior is the only {{type|Flying}} Pokémon in the {{egg|Mineral}} [[Egg Group]].
* Excluding [[Mega Evolution]]s, Minior is the only Rock-type Pokémon introduced prior to [[Generation VIII]] that cannot be obtained in any Generation VIII game.

===Origin===
Minior is likely based on a {{wp|meteor}}, which are colloquially known as "falling stars" or "shooting stars". The colors of its exposed core roughly correspond with those of a classic {{wp|rainbow}}, or {{wp|ROYGBIV}}. Additionally, Minior's exposed core design may take inspiration from the Portuguese and Japanese star-shaped candy ''{{wp|konpeitō}}'', while its Meteor Form could be a reference to {{wp|gashapon}} machines, which dispense toys in capsules — the toy a machine gives is random each time, and the capsule must be opened to see it, just as Minior must break its outer shell to reveal which color it is.

====Name origin====
Minior may be derived from ''meteor'', and may involve any mixture of the words ''mini'', ''minor'', ''junior'', ''armor'', ''ore'', and ''core''.

Meteno may be a combination of ''meteor'' and ''nano''.
