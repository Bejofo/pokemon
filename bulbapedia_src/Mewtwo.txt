'''Mewtwo''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ミュウツー''' ''Mewtwo'') is a {{type|Psychic}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation I]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Mewtwo can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into two different forms:

* '''Mega Mewtwo X''' using [[Mewtwonite X]].
* '''Mega Mewtwo Y''' using [[Mewtwonite Y]].

It is associated with {{p|Mew}}, and thus they are collectively referred to as the [[Mew duo]] by fans.

==Biology==
Mewtwo is an [[artificial Pokémon]]. It is a bipedal, humanoid {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with some feline features. Its body is primarily gray with a long, purple tail and a large purple underbelly. On top of its head are two short, blunt, ear-like horns, and it has purple eyes. A tube extends from the back of its skull to the top of its spine, bypassing its neck. It has a defined chest and shoulders, which resemble a breastplate. The three digits on each hand and foot have spherical tips. Its tail is thick at the base but thins before ending in a small bulb.

According to [[Pokémon Mansion journals|journals]] found in [[Kanto]]'s {{ka|Pokémon Mansion}}, after discovering the [[Mythical Pokémon]] {{p|Mew}} and gathering some of its DNA, [[Mr. Fuji]] used it in his mansion to create Mewtwo, a modified clone of Mew with the goal to making it the most powerful Pokémon of all. It was held and studied in the mansion, where it acquired extreme power and a vicious disposition after enduring horrific gene-splicing experiments. It eventually broke free and fled the Mansion, destroying it in the process. It is widely known as one of the most powerful Pokémon in existence and is said to have the most savage heart among all Pokémon, lacking compassion and {{a|Pressure|striking fear into its enemy with cold, glowing eyes}}. Mewtwo conserves energy by remaining motionless in order to unleash its full power in battle. Because it was engineered to be the ultimate opponent in battle, it can only think of defeating its foes. Though rarely seen in the wild, it is said to be resting in [[Cerulean Cave|dark]] {{kal|Unknown Dungeon|caves}} somewhere.

In ''[[M01|Mewtwo Strikes Back]]'', {{OBP|Mewtwo|M01}} was shown to be capable of levitation, mind control, memory erasure, telepathy, teleporting others to another location, and the creation of powerful storms. However, it was [[Mewtwo Returns|later shown]] to be caring, protective, and even altruistic. As shown in [[POKÉMON Detective Pikachu]], Mewtwo can also transfer a [[human]]'s soul into a Pokémon's body provided that said Pokémon is in a crazed state, causing this person to gain control of the Pokémon's body and abilities. {{OBP|Mewtwo|M01|It}} possesses a rivalry with {{OBP|Mew|M01}}. As seen in ''[[M16|Genesect and the Legend Awakened]]'', {{OBP|Mewtwo|M16}} can breathe in outer space.

In the [[Pokémon Adventures]] manga, {{adv|Mewtwo}}'s creation wasn't possible with the amount of {{adv|Mew}}'s cells gathered, so to complete it, [[human]] cells were used instead, specifically from the [[Team Rocket]] [[Team Rocket scientist|scientist]] [[Blaine]]. Due to Blaine possessing some of Mewtwo's cells as well, the two became linked, which granted Blaine to ability to track its whereabouts at the cost of slowly taking his life.

Mewtwo is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Psystrike}}.

;Shadow Mewtwo
A unique {{pkmn2|variant}} of Mewtwo, called [[Shadow Mewtwo]], is very similar to standard Mewtwo, but with dark gray skin, a dark gray tail with a yellowish orange tip, and a shard of [[Ferrum#Shadow Synergy Stone|Shadow Synergy Stone]] coming out of its shoulder. In the past, Anne was almost possessed by a Shadow Synergy Stone but was saved by Mewtwo, whom the Shadow Synergy Stone took control of and merged with instead. Under the stone's influence, Shadow Mewtwo travelled around [[Ferrum]], draining Gaia Power from other normal [[Ferrum#Synergy Stones|Synergy Stones]], which continuously increases its power.

===Forms===
Mewtwo has two forms. Mewtwo can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into either Mega Mewtwo X or Mega Mewtwo Y. Additionally, Shadow Mewtwo can Mega Evolve into Mega Shadow Mewtwo X by using [[Ferrum#Synergy Burst|Synergy Burst]].

;Mega Mewtwo X
[[File:Mega Mewtwo X arm.png|thumb|left|250px|Mega Mewtwo X stretching its arm.]]
[[Mega Evolution|Mega]] Mewtwo X is larger and bulkier than its normal state. The horns on its head are longer and extend from brow-like ridges on its forehead. Additionally, the horns are now pointed and curve upward. It now has two tubes behind its neck, its eyes are light blue, and it has large, purple ridges over its shoulders fusing behind its back as a single, hump-like growth. Its forearms and legs grow much bulkier and gain two protruding ridges resembling veins. Its hands and feet grow bigger, with longer, more prehensile digits. Its tail is slightly shorter and stiffer than before and has a curled tip. 

Due to the Mega Evolution, Mega Mewtwo X's physical power received a formidable growth. Its muscles are augmented with psychic power, giving it a grip strength of one ton and the ability to sprint 100 meters in two seconds. When using moves in battle, it is shown to be able to stretch its arms and legs.

;Mega Shadow Mewtwo X
Mega Shadow Mewtwo X greatly resembles its normal counterpart, though it maintains its dark gray coloring due to the influence of the Shadow Synergy Stone. The glowing yellow-orange of the stone's infection is no longer confined to its tail, spreading to both of its shoulder growths, its arm ridges, and the tips of its ears. Additionally, the Y-shaped line running across its body (now including its legs) glows the same yellowish-orange color.

Like its counterpart, Mega Shadow Mewtwo X can stretch its arms and legs. This unique form is achieved when Shadow Mewtwo uses both [[Ferrum#Synergy Burst|Shadow Synergy Burst]] and collected Gaia Power build up. The transformation can be undone if Shadow Synergy Stone is separated from Mewtwo.

;Mega Mewtwo Y
Mega Mewtwo Y is smaller and lighter, losing its long tail, underbelly, and the tube behind its neck. However, it grows a long, purple appendage with a curled tip from the back of its head that is similar to its previous form's tail and also slightly resembles [[Jessie|Jessie's]] hairstyle. On its head, it has two pointed, backward-curving spikes and a half-ring structure connecting to the base of each and crossing over the top of its head. Its eyes are now red and slightly larger. The digits on its hands and feet are now purple and more bulbous and the middle toe is longer than the others. A bumpy ridge similar to a {{wp|sternum}} replaces the breastplate structure on its chest, but this form is still largely smoother than the other two. 

Despite its decreased size, it has phenomenal mental power and is capable of smashing buildings with a mere thought. Mega Mewtwo Y stays constantly in the air due to its smaller size and increased power.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20160406143554/http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/pokemon/mega_pokemon/#Mega%20Mewtwo%20X Mega Mewtwo Y</ref>

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
{{spoilers}}
* [[Pokémon Stadium]]: [[Pokémon Stadium#Vs. Mewtwo|Mewtwo]] is the player's final opponent.
* {{g|Pinball}}: Mewtwo appears in its own bonus stage, where the player must attempt to hit it 25 times within the two-minute time limit to win. Playing this stage repeatedly is the fastest way to build a high score, due to the extremely high point output of 50,000,000 points per hit earned by hitting Mewtwo.
* [[Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs]]: Mewtwo is the final boss of the game, battled once under the control of the evil [[Edward]] "The Thinker", and again under [[Purple Eyes]]. Before this, it is seen charging up in [[Kasa]]'s laboratory in the [[Sky Fortress]].
* {{g|Puzzle League}}: {{OBP|Mewtwo|M01}} reveals that it organized the Puzzle League to find a worthy foe and clones {{Ash}}'s Pokémon. In the Very Hard and Super Hard modes, Mewtwo is the final opponent.
* [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team]]: Mewtwo sleeps in the depths of the [[Western Cave]]. His slumber is interrupted by the arrival of Blastoise and [[Team A.C.T.|Charizard]], whom he defeats without an issue. Once the player confronts him at the deepest parts of the cave, it is possible to recruit Mewtwo.
* {{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}}: Mewtwo appears, having [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolved]] into Mega Mewtwo Y in order to telepathically link up the Pokémon of the world together to try and stop the [[Tree of Life]]'s ascent into space. Like all the other [[Legendary Pokémon]] gathered for this effort, Mewtwo is turned into stone when [[Dark Matter]] is able to regenerate itself. After Dark Matter's defeat, Mewtwo stays at the [[Island of Isolation]] as its lone inhabitant, and can be recruited if it is defeated.
* {{g|Quest}}: A telepathic Mewtwo appears as the final boss of Pokémon Quest. It is trapped (in a vague, undefined manner) in the [[Chamber of Legends]]. It discretely takes control of [[MoBee]] to talk to the [[player (Quest)|player]], in order to lure the player across [[Tumblecube Island]] and collect the {{OBP|statue|Quest}}s that open the Chamber. Once encountered it battles the player's Pokémon to test itself. It did not recover fully from the time it was sealed away, and the player defeats it in battle. After being defeated, Mewtwo departs from the island. After the credits, it telepathically informs the player about [[Happenstance Island]].

Similar to the {{pkmn|animated series}}, Mewtwo was created by [[Team Rocket]] in [[Pokémon Adventures]].

It was completed by [[Blaine]] sometime before ''[[PS034|And Mewtwo Too?!]]'', where it escaped from the hideout and settled into [[Cerulean Cave]].

==Trivia==
[[File:Shadow Mewtwo.png|thumb|100px|Shadow Mewtwo's unique aura]]
* One of the [[Pokémon Mansion journals]] states Mewtwo's birthday is February 6.
** The same journal implies {{p|Mew}} was impregnated with the modified clone, just like with real-life cloning. All other depictions show Mewtwo being grown using laboratory equipment.
* Mewtwo comes before Mew in the [[Pokédex]] despite being created from its modified DNA.
* Even though Mewtwo is a clone of Mew, a Mythical Pokémon, Mewtwo is a Legendary Pokémon.
* Mewtwo was the first Pokémon seen in the English [[dub]], as it appears at the very beginning of the [[Pokémon Theme|first dub opening]].
* Mewtwo has the most {{pkmn|animated series}} opening appearances of any [[Legendary Pokémon]], with seven in Japan.
* Mewtwo and {{p|Charizard}} share several [[Mega Evolution]] similarities. Both Pokémon have two Mega Evolutions instead of one. Both of their Y Mega Evolutions were revealed before their X ones. Both Pokémon change their typing in their X Mega Evolutions while they remain the same type in their Y Mega Evolutions. Both X Mega Evolutions are physically oriented while their Y Mega Evolutions are specially oriented.
* Mewtwo is depicted on the door of [[Bill]]'s lighthouse in ''[[EP013|Mystery at the Lighthouse]]'', despite having only been seen by [[Team Rocket scientist|its creators]] and [[Team Rocket]] at that point in the animated series. Similarly, Mewtwo's sprite was depicted as a portrait in [[Viridian Gym]], despite being a public area.
* The island country of {{wp|Niue}} released a one-dollar coin featuring Mewtwo as part of a commemorative promotion for the Pokémon franchise, with Mewtwo on the reverse side and the nation's crest on the obverse.
* Mewtwo was originally depicted as the only member of its species, being a clone of Mew. In the {{pkmn|animated series}} and {{pkmn|manga}}, however, it is implied that multiple Mewtwo have been created.
* Mega Mewtwo Y was the first [[Mega Evolution]] revealed to the public.
** It was also the first to appear in the animated series, even before Mega Evolution was announced.
** Prior to the announcement of Mega Evolution, Mega Mewtwo Y was referred to as its 「覚醒した姿」 ''Awakened Form''.<ref>[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20130618180918/http://www.pokemon.co.jp/info/2013/06/130615_m02.html?a001=news ポケモン映画最新作『神速のゲノセクト ミュウツー覚醒』へと続くオリジナルストーリーが、テレビで放送決定！]</ref> This term was also used in the {{ma|Genesect and the Legend Awakened|manga adaptation of the movie}}.
** Mega Mewtwo Y was designed by [[Tomohiro Kitakaze]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/kitakazeee/status/1149513798115459073 Tweet by 北風友裕 (@kitakazeee).] Posted on July 12, 2019.</ref>
* Mewtwo's Mega Evolutions are tied with Mega {{p|Rayquaza}} for the highest base stat total of all Pokémon, with 780, excluding the unobtainable [[List of Pokémon with form differences#Eternatus|Eternamax]] {{p|Eternatus}}.
** Mega Mewtwo X has the highest base {{stat|Attack}} of all Pokémon, as well as the highest single base stat and base {{stat|Special Attack}} of all {{type|Fighting}} Pokémon.
*** Mega Mewtwo X's Attack increase is the largest single stat increase of all Mega Evolutions, at 80 points.
** Mega Mewtwo Y has the highest base Special Attack of all Pokémon and the highest single base stat of all Psychic-type Pokémon.
*** With a Mild [[Nature]], perfect [[IV]]s, and optimized [[EV]]s, a [[Level]] 100 Mega Mewtwo Y's stats sum to 2038, the highest sum of any Pokémon.
* In [[Pokémon GO]], Shadow Mewtwo is the only {{OBP|Shadow Pokémon|GO}} that has a different aura from the other Shadow Pokémon that isn't an Apex Shadow; instead of purple fire, it is surrounded by an aura resembling its Psychic power. It does not have a unique appearance when purified, however.
* Mewtwo is currently the only Legendary Pokémon in {{g|GO}} to have an [[Event Pokémon (GO)|event-exclusive form]].
* In {{game2|Gold|Silver|Crystal}}, {{pkmn2|wild}} Mewtwo are programmed to always be holding a [[Berserk Gene]], but Mewtwo can't be obtained in those games without trading. Even if Mewtwo could be found in the wild, the Berserk Gene would be consumed immediately, so the item wouldn't be obtainable.
* {{p|Lugia}} and {{p|Ho-Oh}}'s base stats are based on Mewtwo's, with some values swapped.
* Mega Mewtwo X and Mega Mewtwo Y are the only Mega Evolutions introduced in [[Generation VI]] that are currently unavailable in Pokémon GO.

===Origin===
Like Mew, Mewtwo has some domestic {{wp|cat}} and {{wp|embryo}} characteristics, but its body structure is much larger as a result of {{wp|Recombinant DNA|gene splicing}}. It also has some characteristics of a {{wp|grey alien}} and a {{wp|salamander}}. 

Mega Mewtwo Y, much like Mew, has characteristics of a vertebrate {{wp|embryo}}.

====Name origin====
Mewtwo may be a combination of ''{{p|Mew}}'' or ''mutant (ミュータント)'' and ''two''.
