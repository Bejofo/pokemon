'''Pichu''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ピチュー''' ''Pichu'') is an {{type|Electric}} [[baby Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation II]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Pikachu}} when [[friendship Evolution|leveled up with high friendship]], which evolves into {{p|Raichu}} when exposed to a [[Thunder Stone]].

Pichu has an alternate [[#Form data|form]] called '''[[Spiky-eared Pichu]]''' that appeared in {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}}, as well as in ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' and the [[Pokémon Adventures]] manga. A special Pichu called '''[[Ukulele Pichu]]''' is the player's first {{OBP|Partner Pokémon|Ranger}} in {{g|Ranger: Guardian Signs}}.

==Biology==
Pichu is a small, ground-dwelling {{wp|rodent}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with pale yellow fur. Its ear-tips, collar, and tail are black and angular. Pichu's pink cheek pouches can store small amounts of electricity, and its tiny nose looks like a dot. Pichu is classified as a quadruped, but it can walk easily on its hind legs.

Pichu is a social Pokémon known for its playful and mischievous demeanor. It is usually found in groups and often touch tails with other Pichu as a show of courage, creating a shower of sparks that can make them cry. It is inept at storing electricity and may discharge if amused, startled, or subjected to shock. However, it cannot discharge without being shocked itself. Charging up is more easily done on days of dryness or with thunderclouds. The crackling of static electricity generated by Pichu is audible. It can zap an adult human but will surprise itself if it does. Pichu primarily lives in the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Forest Pokémon|forest}}, though it has also [[PK07|been depicted]] to thrive in urban areas. As mentioned in {{g|Sleep}}, Pichu is known to discharge uncontrollable electricity while sleeping.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref>This is due to Pichu being unable to store electricity properly. The crackle sound of static electricity can be heard while Pichu sleeps.

Pichu and its evolved forms are the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Volt Tackle}}.

===Forms===
Pichu has an alternate form called [[Spiky-eared Pichu]]. It is female-only and has three spikes on the tip of its ear, but otherwise looks the same as any other Pichu.

===Form data===
====Spiky-eared Pichu====
[[Spiky-eared Pichu]] is a unique form of Pichu exclusive to {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}}. It is a [[Gender|female]] Pichu that has a tuft of hair on the end of its left ear. It cannot [[Evolution|evolve]], and its [[Pokéathlon]] [[performance]] stats differ from those of a normal Pichu.

Spiky-eared Pichu is obtained by activating [[List of event Pokémon with in-game effects#Pichu|an in-game event]] in [[Ilex Forest]]. This is the only way to obtain Spiky-eared Pichu, and it cannot be traded, so only one can be obtained per game. It also cannot be [[transfer]]red to the [[Generation V]] games.

The Pichu Brothers are a pair of Pichu who have appeared several times, including in ''[[PK07|Pikachu & Pichu]]'', ''[[PK11|Camp Pikachu]]'', several episodes of [[Pokémon Chronicles]], and ''[[Pichu Bros. in Party Panic]]''. The design of one of the brothers is similar to that of [[Ash's Pikachu]] and [[Sparky]], in that it has a scruff of fur on its ear.

=====[[Spiky-eared Pichu]]=====
A Pichu with a spiked ear, known as Spiky-eared Pichu, appeared in ''[[M12|Arceus and the Jewel of Life]]''. She helped {{AP|Pikachu}} and {{TP|Dawn|Piplup}} find the keys for the jail cell that held {{Ash}}, {{an|Dawn}}, {{an|Brock}}, and [[Damos]].

Ash's Pikachu was revealed to have been born as and evolved from a Pichu in ''[[JN001|Enter Pikachu!]]''.

=====Other=====
In ''[[EP179|The Apple Corp]]'', multiple Pichu were stealing apples from {{OBP|Charmaine|EP179}}'s apple orchard. In the end, Charmaine decided to keep all of them so they could help around the orchard.

In ''[[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Team Go-Getters Out of the Gate!]]'', Pichu's big brother Pikachu was lost and he was so worried that he went out to find him. Pichu came across Team Meanies, but they played a trick on him when he asked for their help. Pichu then found Team Go-Getters, who allowed him to accompany them. Pichu was eventually kidnapped by the {{p|Skarmory}} that had kidnapped Pikachu.

In ''[[PK17|Pikachu's Island Adventure]]'', two Pichu, six {{p|Wynaut}}, and a {{p|Buizel}} were forced off their island by {{MTR}} and his cronies, who then claimed it for themselves. As a result, Pikachu and his friends agreed to help them reclaim the island.

In ''[[DP074|Pika and Goliath!]]'', [[Sho]] owns a Pichu as part of his goal to have possession of one Pokémon each from the Pikachu evolutionary line. Arrogant like its Trainer, it would watch both of Sho and his Raichu's battles with Ash.

In ''[[DP190|The Brockster Is In!]]'', [[Normajean]]'s Pichu was badly poisoned by a {{p|Tentacruel}} alongside several of her other baby Pokémon. It was then healed by a {{m|Softboiled}} from [[Brock's Chansey]].

In ''[[XY016|A Jolting Switcheroo!]]'', [[Lena]] owns a Pichu, which is in [[Lyn]]'s care. In the episode, Lyn's bag was accidentally taken by {{an|Bonnie}}, who had a similar bag with her {{TP|Clemont|Dedenne}} inside; they eventually got their bags and Pokémon back.

In ''[[JN090|Showdown at the Gates of Warp!]]'', [[Alternate World Ash]]'s Pikachu briefly appeared as a Pichu while {{OBP|Dialga|recurring}} and {{OBP|Palkia|recurring}} returned all the Pokémon [[Devolution|devolved]] and reverted into {{pkmn|Egg}}s by their influence back to normal.

====Minor appearances====
In ''[[M04|Celebi: The Voice of the Forest]]'', a Pichu was seen in a window on a girl's shoulder during Ash's battle with [[Dundee]].

In ''[[M08|Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]]'', {{OBP|Mew|M08}} {{m|Transform|transformed}} into a Pichu during the [[Aura Guardian Festival]] tournament.

In ''[[AG180|May, We Harley Drew'd Ya!]]'', a {{pkmn|Coordinator}}'s Pichu competed in the [[Appeal|Appeals Round]] of the [[Kanto Grand Festival]].

* Pichu is game director [[Junichi Masuda]]'s favorite Pokémon from [[Generation II]].<ref>http://www.gamepro.com/article/previews/209340/pokemon-platinum-developer-interview-pt-2/</ref>

===Concept and development===
Pichu was designed by [[Ken Sugimori]].<ref name=IGN>Harris, Craig (February 24, 2009). "[https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/02/23/pokemon-creators-on-platinum Pokemon<!--[sic]--> Creators on Platinum]." ''IGN''.</ref>

===Origin===
Pichu seems to draw inspiration from {{wp|squirrel}}s and various other {{wp|rodent}}s. Additionally, according to Junichi Masuda, Ken Sugimori came up with the idea for Pichu when [[Game Freak]] staff were trying to figure out a Pokémon to be the "next" Pikachu.<ref name=IGN />

====Name origin====
Pichu may be a combination of ピカピカ ''pikapika'' (onomatopoeia for sparkling), チューチュー ''chūchū'' (onomatopoeia for the squeak of a mouse), and possibly プチ ''puchi'' (petite), as well as being a contraction of ''{{p|Pikachu}}''.
