'''Pinsir''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''カイロス''' ''Kailios'') is a {{type|Bug}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Pinsir can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Pinsir''' using the [[Pinsirite]].

==Biology==
[[File:Bandai Pinsir card.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The flexibility of Pinsir's horns]]
Pinsir is a bipedal, {{wp|Coleoptera|coleopteran}} {{wp|insectoid}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a wide, dull-brown body divided into segments by thin lines. On top of its head is a large pair of gray, spiky pincers on top of its head. In its mouth are many long, flat teeth arranged horizontally, and it has triangular eyes. Capable of seeing color to some degree, Pinsir appears to be attracted to the color green. Its legs are short and thick, while its arms are long and thin. It has three claws on each hand and foot; two of its toes face forward and one backward.

Pinsir can use its pincers to crush, toss, bludgeon, or tear opponents; lift things twice its weight; and shatter logs. Captured prey is kept in place by the piercing thorns and sheer strength of Pinsir's horns and will not be released until they are torn in half. Pinsir's horns are quite flexible as depicted in the [[Bandai Pokémon Carddass Cards]] where they have a wide range of motion. In addition to hunting prey, it's shown in the ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' episode ''[[EP119|A Sappy Ending]]'' that it enjoys tree sap. Pinsir lives deep in the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Forest Pokémon|temperate forests and jungles}}, where it burrows underground or hides in the treetops on nights cold enough to render it immobile. In {{g|Sleep}}, Pinsir burrows itself into the ground to sleep during cold nights but its pincers can be seen sticking out of the ground as it slumbers. In [[Alola]], it has a rivalry with {{p|Vikavolt}} and gets along with {{p|Heracross}}. Pinsir are known to judge each other based on their pincers. The pincers determine its popularity with the opposite gender based on how more thick and impressive it looks.

===Forms===
Pinsir can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Pinsir.

As Mega Pinsir, it gains a large pair of clear, yellow wings with an area of orange {{wp|Insect wing#Venation|venation}} near the base. Additionally, a set of brown {{wp|elytron|elytra}} appear. Slicing through each elytron is a pair of orange blades. Its arms become longer, and it has a T-shaped spike on each forearm. The pincers on its head are now longer with larger spikes, and its eyes are now yellow.

When it Mega Evolves, Pinsir is left in a constant state of excitement. It rarely touches the ground due to its ability to now fly. Mega Pinsir can travel up to approximately 30&nbsp;mph (50&nbsp;km/h) and uses its two large horns to pierce its enemies before shredding them. Mega Pinsir can lift opponents up to 10 times heavier than itself with its horns and still fly around easily.

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
* {{g|Stadium 2}}: Pinsir stars in a mini-game alongside {{p|Scyther}} called "Clear Cut Challenge." Each player chops a falling log for each round of the game. The score for each player is determined by how close the player is to the white line on the log. Cuts anywhere above the log will cause the player to lose points.

==Trivia==
* Pinsir can be seen as a parallel to {{p|Scyther}}. Both are {{type|Bug}} {{cat|Generation I Pokémon}}. Pinsir is exclusive to {{game3|Red and Blue|Blue|s}}, {{game3|FireRed and LeafGreen|LeafGreen|s}}, {{game3|Diamond and Pearl|Pearl|s}}, and {{LGPE|Let's Go, Eevee!}}, while Scyther is exclusive to Red, FireRed, Diamond, and Let's Go, Pikachu!.
** Pinsir can also be seen as a counterpart to {{p|Heracross}}. Both are Bug-type Pokémon based on beetles and lack an [[evolution]]ary line. Pinsir is not part {{t|Fighting}} like Heracross, but it learns several Fighting-type moves by leveling up. Excluding the [[Friend Safari]], both Pokémon and their [[Mega Stone]]s are version exclusives in {{pkmn|X and Y}}: Pinsir and [[Pinsirite]] are exclusive to X while Heracross and [[Heracronite]] are exclusive to Y. Each Mega Stone can be found in [[Santalune Forest]] in its respective version. The heights of both Pokémon are the same, even when Mega Evolved. The Pokémon are also version exclusives in the [[Pokémon Sword and Shield Expansion Pass]]. Pinsir can be found on the [[Isle of Armor]] if playing Sword, whereas Heracross can be found in its place when playing Shield.
* Mega Pinsir is tied with {{me|Heracross}}, Mega {{p|Scizor}}, and {{p|Genesect}} for the highest base stat total of all {{type|Bug}} Pokémon.
* Pinsir shares its category with {{p|Vikavolt}}. They are both known as the Stag Beetle Pokémon.
* In X and Y, Mega Pinsir has the same [[List of Pokémon by shape|shape]] as when it is not Mega Evolved.
* Pinsir's attraction to the color green may be a reference to how it is exclusive to {{game|Red and Green|s|Pokémon Green}}. This is similar to {{p|Scyther}}'s depiction in the {{aniseries|OS}} episode ''[[EP042|Showdown at Dark City]]'' where Scyther becomes enraged at the sight of the color red, with Scyther likewise being exclusive to {{game|Red and Green|s|Pokémon Red}}.

===Origin===
Pinsir seems to be based on a {{wp|stag beetle}}, possibly ''{{wp|Prosopocoilus inclinatus}}'', a species commonly used in {{wp|insect fighting}}. Its thorn-like {{wp|Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandibles}} most closely resemble that of ''{{wp|Lucanus maculifemoratus}} hopei'', whereas its Mega Evolved form's diagonal spikes resemble ''Calcodes versicolor''.

====Name origin====
Pinsir is a corruption of ''pincer'', referring to its horns.

Kailios may be a combination of the Greek letter ''{{wp|Chi (letter)|Χ}}'' (カイ ''kai''), 刈 ''kai'' (shear), 魁偉 ''kaii'' (brawny), ''cross'' (referring to its {{m|X-Scissor|scissor-like horns}}), and κοριός ''korios'' ({{wp|Greek language|Greek}} for ''bug'').
