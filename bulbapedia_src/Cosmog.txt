'''Cosmog''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''コスモッグ''' ''Cosmog'') is a {{type|Psychic}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation VII]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Cosmoem}} starting at [[level]] 43, which evolves into either {{p|Solgaleo}} or {{p|Lunala}} starting at level 53 depending on the game it evolves in.
* In {{pkmn|Sun and Moon|Pokémon Sun}}, {{pkmn|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|Ultra Sun}}, {{pkmn|Sword and Shield|Sword}}, and {{pkmn|Scarlet and Violet|Scarlet}}, Cosmoem evolves into Solgaleo.
* In {{pkmn|Sun and Moon|Pokémon Moon}}, {{pkmn|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|Ultra Moon}}, {{pkmn|Sword and Shield|Shield}}, and {{pkmn|Scarlet and Violet|Violet}}, Cosmoem evolves into Lunala.

A [[Ash's Solgaleo|Cosmog]] played an important role in {{aniseries|SM}}.

It is associated with the [[guardian deities]]. It was hypothesized to be an [[Ultra Beast]].

==Biology==
[[File:Cosmog SM concept art.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Cosmog tend to have child-like wonder]]
Cosmog is a small {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a gaseous body similar to a {{wp|nebula}}. The gases that make up its body range in color from violet to light blue. The very center of its body is black both in front and back. The black space on the front contains its face, which consists of beady yellow eyes, circular blue cheeks, and a small mouth. The space on the back has only a single blue dot. There is a golden half-circlet on both the top and bottom half of its body, which divides it exactly in half. Two wispy extensions containing starry specks serve as its arms. Cosmog's gaseous body makes it one of the [[List of Pokémon by weight|lightest Pokémon]] in existence.

Cosmog's body is frail and easily blown away. However, it is carefree and doesn't seem to mind. It collects dust from the atmosphere, which allows it to grow slowly. Cosmog has the ability to warp itself and those close to it. Professor [[Mohn]]'s research tells that Cosmog can also open [[Ultra Wormhole]]s when under extreme stress. This process is very dangerous for Cosmog, and the use of its powers can leave it immobile for extended periods of time, or even fatal when used improperly. According to [[Lusamine]], the gases from Cosmog can also be extracted to create Ultra Wormholes.<ref>{{g|Sun and Moon}}: ''"I was able to open the Ultra Wormhole using just the gases we'd extracted from Cosmog when it was in Aether Paradise, wasn't I?"''</ref> 

Cosmog is theorized by the [[Aether Foundation]] to be a type of [[Ultra Beast]], and its name was coined by one of the professors at the Foundation. In the ancient times, it was known as “The child of the stars” by the people of [[Alola]]. When angered, Cosmog's wisps will puff up in a comedic way. In behavior, Cosmog has an overly trusting nature and it immediately takes a liking to whoever shows it kindness, even when that person doesn't have the best intentions for it.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20171223081047mp_/https://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/cosmog/ Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Cosmog]</ref> Cosmog is known to be very curious but not very cautious; this behavior has often led to Cosmog willingly put itself in danger, only to {{m|teleport}} away should things get dicey. This Pokémon can also be created by {{p|Solgaleo}} and {{p|Lunala}}, probably as a some type of reproduction. The [[guardian deities]] watch and protect Cosmog until it fully evolves and returns to [[Ultra Space]] to repeat the cycle.

===NPC appearances===
*{{game4|SMUSUM}}: [[Nebby|Cosmog]], [[nickname]]d Nebby, is a major character in the games. It eventually evolves into {{p|Cosmoem}}, and later into {{p|Solgaleo}}{{sup/7|SUS}}/{{p|Lunala}}{{sup/7|MUM}}.
* {{g|Sword and Shield}}: Cosmog, nicknamed Fwoofy, is a minor character in [[The Crown Tundra]]. It was found by an elderly woman in [[Freezington]] and was brought into her home. It is also supposedly the cause of the appearance of "strange Pokémon" in the [[Crown Tundra]]. Once the player stops {{p|Glastrier}}/{{p|Spectrier}}'s attack on the village, the woman offers to let Fwoofy travel with the player, seeing them as worthy of taking care of it.

{{-}}

==In the manga==
[[File:Nebby Adventures.png|thumb|200px|Cosmog in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===Pokémon Adventures===
{{main|Lunala (Adventures)}}
{{main|Solgaleo (Adventures)}}
A Cosmog [[nickname]]d [[Nebby]] first appeared in ''[[PASM04|The Decision and the Tournament of Six]]'', under the care of [[Lillie]]. It was first seen escaping from Lillie's bag and running off to [[Mahalo Trail]], where it was attacked by wild {{p|Spearow}}. When {{adv|Moon}} stepped in to save it, Nebby broke the bridge they were standing on, causing both to fall towards the water until they were saved by {{p|Tapu Koko}}. It [[PASM17|later]] evolved into a {{p|Cosmoem}} and then into a {{p|Lunala}}.

Another Cosmog first appeared in ''[[PASM18|Confusion and Monsters from Another World]]'', under the control of [[Guzma]], who had received it from the [[Aether Foundation]]. It was used to open multiple [[Ultra Wormhole]]s around [[Po Town]] to summon [[Ultra Beast]]s. It later evolved into a Cosmoem and then into a {{p|Solgaleo}}.

A Cosmog appeared in a fantasy in ''[[PASM25|Summon the Emissaries of the Moon and the Sun]]''.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Cosmog (TCG)}}
==Trivia==
* Cosmog and its evolved form, {{p|Cosmoem}}, are the only Pokémon who are unable to damage an opponent outside of {{m|Struggle}}.
* Cosmog and Cosmoem are the only Pokémon to be unobtainable without [[transfer]] in a game in which their evolved forms ({{p|Solgaleo}} and {{p|Lunala}}) are obtainable, that being {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}.
* Cosmog's Evolution into Cosmoem has the greatest {{wp|standard deviation}} of all Pokémon, with 47.14, meaning that the changes to its base stats upon evolving are the most uneven of all Pokémon.
* Cosmog is the [[List of Pokémon by weight|lightest]] {{type|Psychic}} Pokémon, the lightest Legendary Pokémon, and tied for the lightest Pokémon overall, being put at 0.1 kg (0.2 lbs.)
** Due to its Evolution, Cosmoem (at 999.9 kg (2204.4 lbs.)), being tied for the heaviest Pokémon in these categories, it is the only evolutionary line to hit both extremes of any measurement or stat.
** Cosmog gains the most weight out of any Pokémon upon evolving, with an increase of 999,800%.
* In games prior to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, Cosmog has a catch rate of 45.
* Cosmog, Cosmoem, and {{p|Type: Null}} were the first instances of [[Legendary Pokémon]] able to [[evolve]], with all three debuting in {{g|Sun and Moon}}.
* Cosmog is the first Legendary Pokémon owned by a {{Ash|main character}} in the {{pkmn|animated series}}.

===Origin===
Cosmog may be based on a {{wp|molecular cloud}}, a type of {{wp|nebula}} where star formation occurs.

====Name origin====
Cosmog may be a combination of ''{{wp|cosmos}}'' or ''{{wp|cosmogony}}'', and ''fog'' or ''smog''. In-universe, a [[mohn|professor]] working at the [[Aether Foundation]] named the Pokémon.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20161118233920mp_/http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/cosmog/ Pokémon Sun and Moon official website (archived)]: "''The Aether Foundation is researching this unusual Pokémon, and one of the professors at the foundation recently dubbed it Cosmog.''"</ref>
