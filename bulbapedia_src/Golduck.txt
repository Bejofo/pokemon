'''Golduck''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ゴルダック''' ''Golduck'') is a {{type|Water}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s from {{p|Psyduck}} starting at [[level]] 33.

==Biology==
Golduck is a blue, bipedal, {{wp|duck}}, or {{wp|platypus}}-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. It has red eyes, a cream-colored beak, a red gem in the center of its forehead, and four spikes on the back of its head. Its hands and feet all have three clawed digits with cream-colored webbing in between. Its body is specially adapted to have a hydrodynamic shape, and it has a long tail that it uses as a rudder to steer. Golduck is sometimes mistaken for the Japanese monster, and the physical inspiration for Golduck, the {{wp|Kappa (folklore)|Kappa}} due to its general humanoid shape, beak, and webbed hands and feet.

Golduck is a fast swimmer, capable of out-swimming even the most athletic of humans because of its webbed appendages. Even rough seas do not hamper this Pokémon's swimming abilities, and it will sometimes rescue people from shipwrecks. The [[TCG]] [[Golduck (Sun & Moon 29)|depicts]] Golduck with the ability to shoot massive jets of water form both of its hands simultaneously, using them to propel itself underwater. The gem on its forehead glows when it uses its psychic powers, and occasionally when it swims at full speed. In the past, this Pokémon was overhunted due to the belief that the gem granted people supernatural powers. As seen in [[PS028|Pokémon Adventures]], Golduck has the ability to give knowledge to its Trainer and fellow Pokémon through telepathy. Golduck can typically be seen swimming in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Water's-edge Pokémon|lakes}}, where it hunts fish. The prey is disabled, captured, and then brought to shore for consumption. Old tales claim Golduck punishes those who defile their rivers by dragging them in and taking them away. As mentioned in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Golduck is known to paddle its webbed limbs while sleeping.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref>It is believed Golduck is dreaming about swimming.

Prior to [[Generation V]], Golduck and its pre-evolved form, {{p|Psyduck}}, were the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that could have {{a|Cloud Nine}} as an [[Ability]].

{{main|Golduck (TCG)}}

==Trivia==
===Origin===
Golduck appears to be based on a {{wp|duck}}. However it shares some similarities with {{wp|platypus}}, such as having limbs with webbed hands instead of wings. 

According to its Pokédex entry, it is inspired by the ''{{wp|Kappa (folklore)|kappa}}''. Similar to kappas, Golduck is said to drag people into the water and is described as an excellent swimmer. Additionally, Golduck's shiny blue skin may be based on {{wp|wetsuit}}s worn by divers and swimmers.

Golduck's pearl-like gem is likely a nod to a shirikodama, a small ball containing a person's soul that was often stolen by kappas. However, its placement on Golduck's forehead seems to allude to the concept of a "{{wp|third eye}}", correlating with its psychic abilities.

====Name origin====
Golduck may be a combination of ''gold'' and ''duck''. While Golduck itself is not colored gold, gold is often used to {{wp|Gold (color)#Parapsychology|symbolize psychic abilities}} e.g., the {{DL|Gummi|Gold Gummi}} is the Gummi variety loved by Psychic-type Pokémon, and the {{Badge|Marsh}}'s Japanese name is "Gold Badge".
