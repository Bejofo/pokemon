'''Unown''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''アンノーン''' ''Unknown'') is a {{type|Psychic}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation II]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Unown has {{fd|Unown|28 different forms}}. All of them are known as '''One form''', as seen in the [[Pokédex]].

In [[Generation II]], there were 26 Unown forms based on Latin alphabet characters. In [[Generation III]], two new forms were introduced as well: ''?'' (question mark) and ''!'' (exclamation mark). The Unown forms are chronicled in the [[Unown Mode]], the [[Unown Report]], and the [[Unown Research Notes]].

In Generation II, its shape is determined by its [[individual values]]; in Generation III, it is determined by its [[personality value]]; from [[Generation IV]] onwards, it is determined by a separate form identifier.

==Biology==
[[File:Pokémon HOME Wallpaper Unown.png|left|thumb|150px|right|The Unown wallpaper in Pokémon HOME]]
Unown is a flat, thin {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} shaped like a circular eye with appendages that make it resemble a letter or a punctuation mark. It is entirely black, except for its white sclerae. All 26 alphabetic forms of Unown have fully open eyes, while the two punctuation forms have half-closed eyes. Though each of its forms has a counterpart in the Latin alphabet, Unown is said to resemble ancient writing and hieroglyphs called [[Unown symbols]]. It is a mystery whether Unown predates or postdates written language, and therefore which one is based on the other. Unown can move its appendages independently like tentacles or fingers.

In the Japanese version of {{game|Crystal}}, a researcher implies that the Unown began appearing at the [[Ruins of Alph]] after the [[Pokémon Communication Center]] was built in [[Goldenrod City]]. This text was translated and left unused in the English release.<ref>[https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/maps/RuinsOfAlphResearchCenter.asm Pokecrystal Disassembly; maps/RuinsOfAlphResearchCenter.asm]</ref>

The [[Pokédex]], [[Unown Report]], and [[Professor Oak]]'s research disagree on whether Unown communicates using electromagnetic waves (specifically radio waves) or telepathy. Either way, it can be detected by the [[Pokégear]] radio, which interprets it as the melody of the [[Azure Flute]]. Unown has an unknown connection to {{p|Arceus}}. It is said that an "odd power" emerges when more than one Unown come together. Certain Unown loose in the [[Hisui]] [[region]] were capable of repelling [[Poké Ball]]s that contained Pokémon, preventing them from being {{pkmn|battle}}d. [[Professor Laventon]]'s research observed that Unown resemble human writing from other lands, though no one took him seriously. In the [[Pokémon movie]] ''[[M03|Spell of the Unown: Entei]]'', Unown is shown to be capable of reading the thoughts of other life forms. Great numbers of Unown are capable of distorting reality to suit the dreams and wishes of whoever is in control of the Unown. However, they can only do this when more Unown are present, so it could be a shared effort rather than an ability unique to each Unown.

Unown is an extremely {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|rare Pokémon}} that lives in [[Unown Dimension|its own dimension]] and rarely ventures outside. When it moves to the [[Pokémon world]], Unown tends to stick to walls like engravings of ancient texts, or orbit other Unown, usually in [[ruins]].

In Pokémon Crystal, the Unown are said to share a cooperative bond with {{p|Suicune}}.<ref><blockquote><p>Of the legendary POKéMON, SUICUNE is said to be the closest to HO-OH. I hear there may also be a link to POKéMON known as UNOWN. The POKéMON UNOWN must be sharing a cooperative bond with SUICUNE."</p><p>Wise Trio, [https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/maps/TinTower1F.asm Pokecrystal Disassembly]</p></blockquote></ref>

In [[Generation VIII]], Unown is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Hidden Power}}.

===Forms===
Unown has 28 separate forms, all referred to as "One form". [[Pokédex 3D Pro]], the [[Pokémon Trading Card Game]], and other supplemental materials such as official guidebooks refer to each form by the letter or symbol they represent.

In {{g|GO}}, Unown can be obtained by completing 1/4 of the [[Special Research]], ''Level 50 Challenge''.

===Form data===
Unown has 28 non-interchangeable forms, each corresponding to a typographic character. All Unown forms are known as "One form", as seen in the [[Pokédex]].

Unown was the first Pokémon to have multiple forms in the games. In its debut in [[Generation II]], there were 26 forms of Unown, corresponding to each of the 26 letters of the {{wp|Latin alphabet}}. In the [[Generation III]] games, Unown gained two additional forms, corresponding to the {{wp|question mark}} and {{wp|exclamation mark}}.

In the Generation II games, Unown's form is determined by its {{IV}}s, which results in some strange phenomena; for example, in Generation II, only Unown I and V can be {{Shiny}} due to Shininess also being determined by IVs in these games. In the [[Generation III]] games, Unown's form is determined by its [[personality value]]. From the Generation IV games onward, Unown's form is determined by a [[Pokémon data structure (Generation IV)#Alternate forms|separate form identifier]], unrelated to the personality value.

While Unown's form has no bearing on [[base stats]], punctuation Unown have different [[performance]] stats than alphabetical Unown.

Various games have special catalogs for documenting Unown's forms: in {{game2|Gold|Silver|Crystal}}, the [[Unown Mode]] is an upgrade to the Pokédex obtained at the [[Ruins of Alph]]; in {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}}, the [[Unown Report]] is obtainable instead. In {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, the [[Unown Research Notes]] serves this purpose.

==In animation==
[[File:Unown anime.png|thumb|250px|Unown in {{aniseries|JN}}]]
===Major appearances===
====[[Unown (M03)]]====
Unown played a large role in ''[[M03|Spell of the Unown: Entei]]'', creating the illusions that drive the plot.

Notes about Unown can be seen on {{an|Professor Oak}}'s computer at the beginning of the movie. The information (as presented in the Japanese version) has been cleaned up and transcribed here:
* Because of their very timid and careful character, Unown do not want to go out to the external world.
* Unown have the power to perceive the feelings of other creatures (including human beings).
* Unown communicate with each other over electromagnetic waves but cannot use telepathy.
* Given all this, Unown are still classified as a species of Pokémon, as opposed to any other sort of creature.

====Other====
In ''[[EP263|Address Unown!]]'', an Unown G fell out of the [[Unown Dimension]]. After it was healed by the group, it helped defend them against {{TRT}}, and its mind merged with that of [[Ash's Larvitar]] so that the group could help it address its inner pain.

[[File:Tablet DP060.png|thumb|250px|The tablet]]
[[Unown symbols|Markings of Unown]] were observed on a tablet in ''[[DP040|Top-Down Training!]]''.

In [[PK21]], an Unown F fell out of the [[Unown Dimension]] following an unspecified incident, and {{AP|Pikachu}} and his friends had to help it return to the Unown Dimension so it could reunite with the other Unown.

In ''[[JN083|Star Night, Star Flight!]]'', five Unown covered a town in [[Johto]] with an endless night in order to help {{OBP|Tiara|JN083}} accept parting ways with her {{p|Cleffa}}. Once she finally realized it was time to say goodbye, the Unown returned day to the town and departed.

===Minor appearances===

==In the manga==
[[File:Bugsy Unown Adventures.png|thumb|250px|Unown in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===Pokémon Adventures===
===={{MangaArc|Gold, Silver & Crystal}}====
Unown first appeared in ''[[PS100|Into the Unown]]'' at the [[Ruins of Alph]]. During a battle with the [[Team Rocket Elite Trio]], {{adv|Gold}} had his {{p|Sunkern|Sunbo}} use {{m|Flash}}, accidentally awakening the Unown from their slumber. Angered, the Unown retaliated on [[Team Rocket]], defeating them.

[[Bugsy]] later returned to study the ruins further in ''[[PS134|Hurray for Heracross]]'', where he {{pkmn2|caught}} an Unown G and gave it to one of his colleagues. Later, as he searched for {{DL|Legendary beasts (Adventures)|Suicune}}, he found two chambers with [[Unown symbols]].

Three Unown appeared in a flashback in ''[[PS139|Raising Raichu]]'', being the N, G, and U forms.

===={{MangaArc|FireRed & LeafGreen}}====
In ''[[PS280|Some Things Are Better Left Unown]]'', [[Sird]] gained control of a small army of Unown after awakening them in the [[Tanoby Ruins]]. She initially used them as a distraction against [[Lorelei]], allowing her to defeat the [[Elite Four]] member. Sird later used them to impede the progress of {{adv|Red}}, {{adv|Blue}}, and {{adv|Green}} as they headed to the [[Trainer Tower]], but they were defeated by {{adv|Mewtwo}}. Also, two Unown of the ! and ? forms followed {{adv|Giovanni}} to [[Birth Island]] to relay his successful capture of {{adv|Deoxys}} back to the [[Rocket Warehouse|Team Rocket Warehouse]].

===={{MangaArc|Diamond & Pearl}}====
In ''[[PS384|Knowledge of the Unown I]]'', a D and P Unown befriended {{adv|Diamond}}, {{adv|Pearl}}, and {{adv|Platinum}} in [[Solaceon Town]]. The two enlisted the help of the Pokédex holders to free their friends from a chamber in the [[Solaceon Ruins]]. Later, they helped to defeat the {{tc|Team Galactic Grunt}} blocking Pearl's path to [[Veilstone City]].

===={{MangaArc|HeartGold & SoulSilver}}====
In ''[[PS455|All About Arceus IV]]'', a massive group of Unown were spawned at the [[Sinjoh Ruins]] when {{adv|Arceus}} created {{DL|Pokémon of myth (Adventures)|Dialga}}, {{DL|Pokémon of myth (Adventures)|Palkia}}, and {{DL|Pokémon of myth (Adventures)|Giratina}}.

===Pokémon: Yeah! I Got Pokémon!===

==In the TCG==
{{main|Unown (TCG)}}

The English [[Pokédex]] data for Unown cards in the {{TCG|Neo Destiny}} expansion say that it is believed that the variety of types of Unown is a result of {{wp|adaptation|evolutionary adaptation}}, but this is not present in the original Japanese text.

==Other appearances==
===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]===
When one Unown is released from a {{i|Poké Ball}}, it will fly off the screen. It then returns with a large swarm, similar to what {{p|Beedrill}} did in the original [[Super Smash Bros.]] The only difference is that Beedrill only attacks from left or right while Unown can come from any direction. Any opponent caught in this barrage is damaged and juggled.

There are also a number of Unown Poké Floats featured in the [[Poké Floats]] stage. In the second half of the stage's cycle, numerous Unown fly across the screen. Towards the end of the cycle, staying on the stage relies on hopping between the Unown.

====Trophy information====
''These Psychic-type symbol Pokémon resemble ancient hieroglyphics found on rocks, a resemblance that's said to be more than superficial. Quite a few different shapes of Unown have been confirmed, and it's believed that each type has unique abilities. These enigmatic Pokémon can be found in the [[Ruins of Alph]].''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Unown does not return as a Poké Ball Pokémon, though it is a {{sbw|Spirits (characters)|Spirit}}, appearing in its F form.

This is a list of music associated with Unown in the Pokémon games.

==Trivia==
[[File:Composite Unreleased Unown.png|thumb|The Unown featured in ''[[M03|Spell of the Unown: Entei]]'']]
* Unown was designed by [[Ken Sugimori]], who had wanted to make a Pokémon with a more surreal design.<ref name=Shmuplations>(2001). ゲーム・マエストロ〈VOL.4〉デザイナー/イラストレーター編 ([https://shmuplations.com/pokemon/ English translation by Shmuplations])</ref>
* In ''[[M03|Spell of the Unown: Entei]]'', {{an|Professor Oak}} had some pictures of Unown on his computer which have never appeared in any other media. Some resemble {{wp|Greek alphabet}} letters, particularly σ (lowercase {{wp|sigma}}), Σ (capital sigma), Π (capital {{wp|pi (letter)|pi}}), and Ω (capital {{wp|omega}}). The top left large image also resembles the Greek ligature, Ȣ ({{wp|ou (ligature)|ou}}). Others resemble the {{wp|Cyrillic script|Cyrillic}} letters ю ({{wp|yu (Cyrillic)|yu}}) and б (lowercase {{wp|be (Cyrillic)|be}}). The Unown in the top-middle large image resembles the Cyrillic я ({{wp|ya (Cyrillic)|ya}}).
* If a player does not have Unown's Pokédex data on a [[Generation II]] game when in Oak's lab in {{g|Stadium 2}}, Unown's Pokédex number is listed as 252 instead of 201. This happens regardless of which Pokédex display mode is selected.{{fact}}
* Unown is the [[List of Pokémon with unique base stat totals|only Pokémon]] with a base stat total of 336.
* After Pikachu, Unown is currently represented in the {{pkmn|Trading Card Game}} by the second-highest number of cards of all Pokémon, with {{#expr: {{PAGESINCATEGORY:Unown (TCG)}} - 1}} unique cards.
** Unown was previously represented by the highest number of cards, as multiple TCG sets included individual cards for each of Unown's forms.
* Unown is the only [[Generation II Pokémon]] that has [[List of Pokémon that do not appear in any regional Browser|not been featured]] in a Ranger series game.
** It is also the only Generation II Pokémon that cannot have the {{DL|Origin mark|Black clover|black clover}} as its [[origin mark]].
* Due to Unown's letter and [[Shiny Pokémon|Shininess]] both being determined by {{IV}}s in Generation II, Shiny Unown will always be either an I or V in these games. This in turn matches the acronym for IVs; however, this is only a coincidence, as "Individual Values" (IVs) is a fan-originated term.
* Unown's ? and ! forms were introduced in {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}}, but they were not originally [[Pokémon availability|available]] anywhere at the time of release of these games and {{pkmn|Colosseum}}. Those forms were first catchable in {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}}.
* Unown is the only Pokémon in the [[List of Pokémon by Sinnoh Pokédex number|Sinnoh Pokédex]] that is neither a {{pkmn2|Legendary}} nor [[Mythical Pokémon]] to not be used by any Trainer in {{game|Diamond and Pearl|s}}.
** Unown is also only Pokémon that is neither a Legendary nor Mythical Pokémon to be in the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Rare Pokémon|Rare Habitat}} in {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}}.
* The two main official artworks for Unown represent [[a:File:201Unown GS.png|a G-shaped Unown]] (for Pokémon Gold and Silver Versions) and [[a:File:201Unown.png|an F-shaped one]] (for Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen onward), which may allude to the acronym for [[Game Freak]].
* The [[a:File:Spr 2g 201W.png|original design of the W-shaped Unown]] used in {{game|Gold and Silver|s}} was altered considerably before {{game|Crystal}}, to [[a:File:Spr 2c 201W.png|a design]] that is in use for all subsequent games.
* Despite Unown being compatible with [[TM10]] in Generations {{gen|VI}} and {{gen|VII}}, it still cannot do so legitimately because it will always already know {{m|Hidden Power}}.
* Unown is the only Pokémon that cannot learn any [[status move]]s.
* Starting in [[Generation IV]], where moves were split into [[damage category|categories]] based on themselves and not their types, Unown can only use its Attack (not Special Attack) stat for {{status|confusion}} damage and {{m|Struggle}}.
* Unown is the only Generation II Pokémon that was never obtainable via the {{g|Dream World}} in [[Generation V]], excluding {{pkmn2|first partner}}, Legendary, and Mythical Pokémon.
** Unown is also the only Pokémon prior to [[Generation V]] that was never obtainable via the Generation V [[Pokémon Global Link]], excluding first partner, Legendary, and Mythical Pokémon.
* In {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, Unown are the only Pokémon that can be found in the wild to lack any preferred foods.

===Origin===
Unown's appearances are eyes and corruptions of the 26 letters of the modern {{wp|Latin alphabet}}, as well as the {{wp|exclamation mark|exclamation}} and {{wp|question mark}}s. Unown's G form specifically may be based on a double-story lowercase {{wp|G}}. The shapes of the Unown are used like graphic symbols in the [[Pokémon world]], although in [[Hoenn]] and the [[Sevii Islands]], their place is taken by [[Braille]]. Unown being weak alone and strong together may be inspired by the idea that a single letter cannot convey much information, but many letters forming a sentence can communicate a hypothetically infinite number of interpretations and ideas.

Unown may also be inspired by the Brahmi or Siddham scripts, used in Japan to mark the graves of important Buddhist figures since at least the 8th century. Because not many people could read Siddham at the time, the script came to be regarded as a mysterious language associated with gods and the Buddha, and several characters (especially in Brahmi) either appear or can be modified to appear as very similar to various Unown.

====Name origin====
Unown may be derived from ''unknown''.

Unknown is literally ''unknown''.
