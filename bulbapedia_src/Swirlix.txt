'''Swirlix''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ペロッパフ''' ''Peroppafu'') is a {{type|Fairy}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation VI]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Slurpuff}} when [[Trade Evolution|traded]] while holding a [[Whipped Dream]].

==Biology==
[[File:684Swirlix PSMD.png|thumb|left|200px|Swirlix with both of its feet visible and its mouth open revealing two fangs]]
Swirlix is a small, round {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} covered with fluffy white fur. It has reddish-pink eyes with white pupils, round ears with light pink tips, a tiny reddish-pink nose, and is often seen with its tongue poking out of the corner of its mouth. When its mouth is open, two upper fangs can be seen. In between its ears is a more prominent tuft of fur. Poking out of the bottom of its fur is its light pink tail. Although Swirlix is typically depicted as levitating to move about, it has a pair of rear paws tucked up in its fur; when exposed, these paws appear to be light pink and have three toes each.

Swirlix only eats sweets, which makes its fur as sticky as cotton candy. Its fur is said to smell like cotton candy. It can entangle its opponents with white sticky thread. The amount of sugar it eats is equal to its weight. It is known to become grumpy if it doesn't eat enough sugar.

Prior to [[Generation VII]], Swirlix and its evolved form, {{p|Slurpuff}}, were the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that could have {{a|Sweet Veil}} as an [[Ability]].

[[File:Swirlix SSB4.png|thumb|left|240px|Swirlix in [[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for 3DS.]]]]

[[File:Swirlix 3DS trophy SSB4.png|thumb|150px|Swirlix trophy in ''Super Smash Bros. for 3DS'']]
Swirlix also appears as a trophy in both versions of the game.

====Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''Swirlix, a Fairy-type Pokémon, has a serious sweet tooth. However, all those sweets make its fur really sticky. If you trade a Swirlix while it holds Whipped Dream, it'll evolve into a Slurpuff. In Smash Bros., Swirlix likes to use Cotton Spore. Getting hit by this attack will seriously slow you down.''

'''PAL''': ''Swirlix has a serious sweet tooth - it eats so many sweets that even its fur is sticky and sweet. Not that you should try eating its fur. In this game, it'll use Cotton Spore to slow down all of the other fighters. See? Definitely not edible. Fun fact: if you trade Swirlix while it's holding a Whipped Dream, it'll evolve!''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Swirlix returns as a Pokémon summoned from the Poké Ball, retaining the same behavior from the previous game.
{{-}}

==Trivia==
* Swirlix can be seen as a parallel to {{p|Spritzee}}. Both are [[Generation VI]] {{type|Fairy}} Pokémon that are version exclusives of [[Pokémon X and Y]] and [[Pokémon Sword and Shield]], with Swirlix being exclusive to X and Sword, and Spritzee to Y and Shield. Both have former [[Signature Ability|signature Abilities]] that affect themselves as well as their allies, and both evolve when traded holding a certain item.

===Origin===
Swirlix appears to be based on {{wp|cotton candy}}—also known as [[Wiktionary:fairy floss|fairy floss]], which may be the inspiration for its [[type]]. The way Swirlix entangles foes in its sticky threads may be a reference to European folktales in which eating fairy food traps mortals in the fairy realm. Considering its lolling tongue, nose, ear-like circular "bumps" on its head, and its tail, it may also be based on a {{wp|lap dog}}, more specifically a {{wp|Bichon Frisé}} or {{wp|poodle}}. Its white body and pink, ear-like bumps may also reference folk beliefs that one can distinguish a fairy dog by its white fur and red ears. Because it can float, Swirlix's white puffy body also resembles a cloud. Its [[Shiny]] variant's tan and brown colors may reference desserts made of both meringue and chocolate, e.g. cookies and pie.

====Name origin====
Swirlix may be a combination of ''swirl'' and ''licks''. It may also involve ''helix''.

Peroppafu may be a combination of ペロペロ ''peropero'' (onomatopoeia for licking) or ''perro'' (Spanish for dog) and ''puff''.
