'''Gengar''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ゲンガー''' ''Gangar'') is a dual-type {{2t|Ghost|Poison}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Haunter}} when [[Trade Evolution|traded]] or when exposed to a [[Linking Cord]]. It is the final form of {{p|Gastly}}.

(Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for more details.)

Additionally, Gengar has two [[#Form data|forms]]: '''Mega Gengar''' and '''Gigantamax Gengar'''. It can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Gengar using the [[Gengarite]], and can [[Gigantamax]] into Gigantamax Gengar if it has the {{DL|Gigantamax|Gigantamax Factor}}.

==Biology==
[[File:094Gengar Dream 5.png|thumb|left|120px|Gengar extending its tongue]]
Gengar is a dark purple, bipedal {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a roundish body. It has red eyes, a wide mouth that is usually curled into a sinister grin, and pointed ears. On its back are numerous spikes, and it has smaller spikes on top of its head similar to tufty fur. Its arms and legs are short with three digits on both its hands and feet. It also has a stubby tail.

Gengar has the ability to hide perfectly in the shadow of any object, granting it exceptional stealth. However, Gengar's body acts as a {{wp|heat sink}}. Its presence cools the temperature of the surrounding area by nearly 10&nbsp;°F (5&nbsp;°C), because it absorbs the warmth. It is shown in {{aniseries|PTS}} that Gengar can fly,<ref>''[[EP023|The Screen Actor's Guilt]]''</ref> turn intangible,<ref>''[[JN018|Destination: Coronation!]]''</ref> possess people<ref>''[[SM073|Why Not Give Me a Z-Ring Sometime?]]''</ref> and other Pokémon, create illusions<ref>''[[EP121|Illusion Confusion!]]''</ref> and extend its tongue<ref>''[[EP181|A Ghost of a Chance]]''</ref> by several meters. In [[Generation I]], {{m|Night Shade}} was its [[signature move]].

Gengar is very mischievous, and at times, malicious. It enjoys playing practical jokes and casting curses, such as pretending to be one's shadow, then behaving erratically. When the quarry notices, the Gengar takes delight in its victim's terror. However, Gengar has been known to be loyal to a {{pkmn|Trainer}} who treats it well. Gengar's shadowy powers can also be {{m|Shadow Ball|manifested offensively}}. Being the result of an [[Evolution]] via [[Trade|trading]], Gengar is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Cave Pokémon|caves}} and dark places where shadows form. It is especially fond of urban areas such as cities and back alleys, but only during the night. As mentioned in {{g|Sleep}}, Gengar is known to sleep deeply while hiding in the shadow of a target it plans to curse.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref>

===Forms===
Gengar has two forms: [[Mega Evolution|Mega]] Gengar and [[Gigantamax]] Gengar.
;Mega Gengar
As Mega Gengar, a portion of its body sinks into the ground, and its arms and tail lengthen. The lower portions turn a more reddish-purple, and a third eye appears on its forehead. This new unblinking eye is oval, yellow, and allows it to see into other dimensions.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150329055725/http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/pokemon/mega_pokemon/ Pokémon X and Y site | Mega Pokémon (archived)]</ref> The spikes on Mega Gengar's back are more numerous and pointed, and additional spikes appear on its hands and tail. Its ears are now considerably longer and tilt backward.

Mega Gengar has the ability to access other dimensions and has a vicious nature. Mega Gengar has no interest in opponents unless perceived as prey. Its relationships are warped due to [[Mega Evolution]]. It now desires to take and curse the life of anyone or anything in its path; it may even curse its own Trainer. Mega Gengar sinks into another dimension to wait for a chance to attack.
;Gigantamax Gengar
As Gigantamax Gengar, it becomes larger, with portions of its body sinking into the ground, and only the head, tail, and arms remain. Its body changes from dark-purple to light-purple, and its eyes become white with yellow sclera. The inside of its mouth changes to resemble a tunnel with a long purple tongue sticking out. Three red clouds surround the top of Gengar's head.

Gigantamax Gengar's mouth is rumored to not lead into its body. Due to the cursed energy, it is believed to instead lead into the afterlife. By laying a trap, it attempts to steal the lives of those it captures. Should someone stand near its mouth, they can hear the voices of their loved ones calling out to them.

Gigantamax Gengar is the only known Pokémon capable of using the [[G-Max Move]] {{m|G-Max Terror}}.

===Evolution===
Gengar evolves from {{p|Haunter}} and is the final form of {{p|Gastly}}.

(For specifics on this Pokémon's Evolution in the games, refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]].)

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
{{spoilers}}
* {{g|Pinball}}: A Gengar appears in a bonus stage accessible from the Red Table. Once the player has knocked out the three {{p|Gastly}} and the pair of {{p|Haunter}}, a Gengar appears and must be defeated to win.
* [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team]]: Gengar is the leader of [[Team Meanies]]. While often accompanied by {{p|Ekans}} and {{p|Medicham}}, Gengar will often act alone and spends much of the game causing trouble, even convincing the village to exile the hero, blaming them for the natural disasters plaguing the world. However, it is later revealed that he is the actual cursed human, having been cursed by {{p|Ninetales}} to be reborn as a Pokémon. After {{p|Rayquaza}} destroys the meteor heading for the world, Gengar will post a request, asking to visit Ninetales in the hopes of bringing back {{mdc|Gardevoir|1}}. While she is rescued, she has no recollection of her times with her Trainer, but Gengar is still satisfied to see her safe and leaves.

In ''[[SM090|Securing the Future!]]'', it joined the rest of [[Alola]] in showering {{an|Necrozma}} with light so it could return to its {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Necrozma|true form}}.

==Trivia==
<!--DO NOT ADD TRIVIA ABOUT GENGAR RESEMBLING CLEFABLE.-->
* In the English [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Gengar's prototype name was "Phantom". This is similar to Gengar's Korean name, which is 팬텀 ''Phantom''.
* Gengar is [[Ken Sugimori]]'s favorite {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. The reason for this is because he finds that Gengar is the easiest Pokémon to draw.<ref name=Pokémon.com>[https://web.archive.org/web/20211108083831/https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/creator-profile-the-creators-of-pikachu/ Creator Profile: The Creators of Pikachu - Pokémon.com] (archived)</ref><ref name=NintendoInt>[https://web.archive.org/web/20101230153442/http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/interview/irbj/sp/index4.html Page 4 of interview with Game Freak, hosted on Nintendo's official website] (Japanese, archived)</ref>
* Despite Gengar and its evolutionary relatives all being part {{type|Poison}}, none of them were able to learn any Poison-type moves by [[level]]ing up until {{LGPE}}.
* Gengar is one of the first two Pokémon to appear in a [[Pokémon battle]] both in {{aniseries|PTS}} and in the {{pkmn|games}}, the other being {{p|Nidorino}}. This is due to their appearance in the opening animation of {{game|Red and Green|s}}, on which the beginning of [[EP001|the first TV episode]] was based on, as well as the Red and Green [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Versions|remakes]].
* Gengar, along with Nidorino (and possibly other Pokémon), originate from the [[Capsule Monsters]] game design pitch, which would eventually become the [[Pokémon]] series.
* In {{game|Yellow}}, Gengar was the only Pokémon included in the [[game credits|credits]] that did not appear in the credits of {{game|Red and Blue|s}}.
* In {{g|X and Y}}, Gengar is the only Pokémon with the Ability Levitate that is not eligible for [[Sky Battle]]s.
* Mega Gengar has the highest base {{stat|Special Attack}} stat of all {{type|Ghost}} and {{type|Poison}} Pokémon.
* When viewing Mega Gengar's [[Pokédex]] entry, the camera's view can only be moved sideways.
* Gengar could be seen as a counterpart to {{p|Alakazam}}. They are both the last stage of a three-part evolutionary line, require trading to reach their final stage of Evolution, and are capable of Mega Evolution. They are the same height, and both get shorter upon Mega Evolution. They share a base friendship of 70 and, since Generation VI, a base stat total of 500. Both are weak to the other's [[STAB]], and they share weaknesses to the {{t|Ghost}} and {{t|Dark}} types. In the {{aniseries|OS}} episode ''[[EP072|The Ancient Puzzle of Pokémopolis]]'', a Gengar and an Alakazam are put against each other.
** Gengar could also be seen as a counterpart to {{p|Machamp}}. They are, like Alakazam, the last stage of a three-part evolutionary line, can both be obtained through [[trade Evolution|Evolution induced by trade]], and are capable of [[Gigantamax]]ing in [[Generation VIII]]. Both Gengar and Machamp also share a base friendship of 70. While both are weak against {{type|Psychic}} Pokémon, as Gengar is part {{type|Poison}} and Machamp is a {{type|Fighting}}, Gengar can counter it with its {{t|Ghost}} typing.
* When being escorted through [[Mt. Freeze]] and [[Murky Cave]] in [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team]], [[Team Meanies|Gengar]] knows {{m|Leer}}, {{m|Scratch}}, and {{m|Quick Attack}}, although it [[game move errors|cannot learn]] those moves by any means in any generation. These are the exact same moves {{p|Absol}} has when joining the player's team during this point in the main story. It's likely the data was unintentionally copied over, as escort Pokémon are uniquely coded from normal Pokémon. In the Rescue Team remake, [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX]], Gengar's moves were changed to {{m|Hypnosis}}, {{m|Dream Eater}}, {{m|Shadow Ball}}, and {{m|Sucker Punch}}.
* Gengar's identity as a former human, as described by the Pokédex in Generation VII, may have been inspired by its portrayal in [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team]], which was released 11 years before {{g|Sun and Moon}}.
* In the [[core series]] games, Mega Gengar has small feet that can be seen by recalling it and sending it out. A glitch in [[Pokémon GO]] also allows Mega Gengar's feet to be seen. In [[Pokkén Tournament]], however, Mega Gengar does not have feet. Instead, a portal appears beneath it whenever it is airborne. Its tail will disappear as well.
* When Gengar [[Gigantamax]]es, it doesn't grow on screen. Instead, it pops out of the ground.
* Gengar is the only Pokémon capable of both Gigantamax and Mega Evolution that is not one of the [[Kanto first partner Pokémon]].
* Gengar is the only Ghost-type to have a Gigantamax form.
* Mega Gengar is immune to {{m|Telekinesis}}. This trait is shared with {{p|Diglett}}, {{p|Dugtrio}}, {{p|Sandygast}}, and {{p|Palossand}}.
** In [[Generation VI]], due to a [[glitch]], on the first turn of becoming Mega Gengar, it can still be affected by {{m|Telekinesis}}.
* Gengar is tied with {{p|Snorlax}} for the most Pokédex entries in ''Pokémon the Series'', with a total of 7.

===Design variations===
Gengar's {{Shiny}} coloration is inconsistent between official media. 
* In the [[Generation II]] [[core series]] games as well as several [[side series]] games, Shiny Gengar has a dark, near-black, purple coloration with bright magenta eyes, as seen in {{game2|Gold|Silver|Crystal}}, the {{g|Stadium series}}, {{g|Colosseum}}, {{g|XD: Gale of Darkness}}, and {{g|Battle Revolution}}. 
* In the [[core series]] games, {{g|HOME}}, {{g|GO}}, and {{g|Sleep}}, Shiny Gengar has a dull purple coloration with reddish pink eyes. 
* In {{g|Shuffle}}, {{g|Duel}}, and the {{pkmn|movie}} ''[[M19|Volcanion and the Mechanical Marvel]]'', Shiny Gengar has a lighter, bluer coloration with reddish eyes.

===Concept and development===
Gigantamax Gengar and its {{Shiny}} form were designed by [[James Turner]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/JamesTurner_42/status/1282081394940801025 Tweet by James Turner (@JamesTurner_42).] Posted on July 11, 2020.</ref><ref>[https://twitter.com/JamesTurner_42/status/1283183146972745728 Tweet by James Turner (@JamesTurner_42).] Posted on July 14, 2020.</ref>

===Origin===
<!--DO NOT ADD ANYTHING ABOUT GENGAR RESEMBLING CLEFABLE.-->
Gengar appears to be based on a {{wp|ghost}}. Its evolutionary line appears to depict a ghost crossing from the afterlife into the living world, with Gengar representing one that successfully broke through. This is further supported by Mega Gengar and Gigantamax Gengar, which can create portals to other dimensions and the afterlife, respectively.

Gengar's many abilities revolving around shadows, as well as its [[Pokémon category]], may also suggest it is partially based on {{wp|Shadow person|shadow people}}. Both its Japanese and English name may also hint at it also possibly being inspired by certain ghostly beings, such as the {{wp|Gjenganger|genganger}}, {{wp|wiedergänger}}, or {{wp|doppelgänger}}s. Both of Gengar's types and shadow themes may be based on a {{wp|Ikiryō|生霊 ikiryō}}, specifically the doppelgänger-like ones caused by a paranormal illness called ''{{wp|Ikiryō#Ikiryō_as_an_illness|影の病 kage no yamai}}'' (lit. shadow sickness).

Due to its horn-like ears, large teeth, and dark nature, Gengar may also be loosely based on a {{wp|oni}} or oni masks. Oni sometimes have a third eye in the center of their forehead, which could be the reason for that detail in [[Mega Evolution|Mega]] Gengar. Gengar may also be loosely inspired by the {{wp|Cheshire Cat}}, as it possesses pointed ears, a wide toothy grin, and the ability to vanish at will. 

Gigantamax Gengar may be based on popular depictions of mouth-shaped entryways found in carnivals and amusement park rides, often horror-themed ones. Its huge mouth acting as a portal to the afterlife also hints that it may be based on a {{wp|Hellmouth}}.

====Name origin====
Gengar and Gangar may come from ''-ganger'' or ''-gänger'' (walker), as found in ''genganger'' or ''wiedergänger'' (types of {{wp|revenant}}s), or ''doppelgänger'' (ghostly double of a living person). It may also involve 幻 ''gen'' (phantasm).
