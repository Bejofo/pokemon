'''Pikachu''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ピカチュウ''' ''Pikachu'') is an {{type|Electric}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Pichu}} when [[friendship Evolution|leveled up with high friendship]] and evolves into {{p|Raichu}} when exposed to a [[Thunder Stone]].

In [[Alola]], Pikachu evolves into {{rf|Alolan}} Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone.

Pikachu has sixteen alternate [[#Form data|forms]] that fall into four groups: '''[[Cosplay Pikachu]]''', '''[[Pikachu in a cap]]''', the '''{{OBP|Partner Pokémon|Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|partner}} Pikachu''', and '''Gigantamax Pikachu'''. Ordinary Pikachu can [[Gigantamax]] into Gigantamax Pikachu if it has the {{DL|Gigantamax|Gigantamax Factor}}. Additionally, many other [[Pikachu variants]] have appeared in various media.

Cosplay Pikachu, Pikachu in a cap, the partner Pikachu, and Pikachu with the Gigantamax Factor cannot evolve. The {{OBP|Pikachu|Yellow}} received at the beginning of {{game|Yellow}} will refuse to evolve into Raichu unless it is [[trade]]d and evolved on another save file.

Pikachu is popularly known as the mascot of the [[Pokémon]] franchise and one of [[Nintendo]]'s major mascots. It is also the [[game mascot]] and the [[List of the player's first Pokémon|player's first Pokémon]] in {{game|Yellow}} and {{LGPE|Let's Go, Pikachu!}}, the [[List of the player's first Pokémon|player's first Pokémon]] in {{g|Rumble Blast}} and {{g|Rumble World}}, and has made numerous appearances on the covers of spin-off games.

==Biology==
[[File:Pikachu gender difference anime.png|thumb|left|250px|Pikachu's gender differences in ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'']]
Pikachu is a short, chubby {{wp|rodent}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. It is covered in yellow fur with two horizontal brown stripes on its back. It has a small mouth, long, pointed ears with black tips, and brown eyes. Each cheek is a red circle that contains a pouch for electricity storage. It has short forearms with five fingers on each paw, and its feet each have three toes. At the base of its lightning bolt-shaped tail is a patch of brown fur. A female will have a V-shaped notch at the end of its tail, which looks like the top of a heart. It is classified as a quadruped, but it has been known to stand and walk on its hind legs; therefore, Pikachu is a facultative biped.

[[File:Cramorant Gorging Form anime.png|thumb|left|250px|In the mouth of {{p|Cramorant}}]]
In the ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' episode ''[[EP039|Pikachu's Goodbye]]'', {{pkmn2|wild}} Pikachu are shown to live in groups in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Forest Pokémon|forested areas}}. Pikachu communicate amongst themselves using squeaks and tail-shaking as friendly gestures. In ''[[SM091|A Plethora of Pikachu!]]'', it is shown that [[Alola]]n Pikachu are known to greet each other by sniffing one another and rubbing their tails together. Electricity can be used to receive and send messages with each other, as well as with other {{type|Electric}} Pokémon. It raises its tail to check its surroundings and is occasionally struck by lightning in this position. When groups grow, they can inadvertently cause lightning storms. Pikachu forage for {{Berries}}, which it roasts with electricity to make them tender enough to eat. A sure sign that Pikachu inhabits a location is patches of burnt grass. In [[The Electric Tale of Pikachu]] manga, it is depicted eating and sometimes destroying telephone poles, wires, and other electronic equipment. By occasion, it can get unintentionally swallowed by {{p|Cramorant}}. While startled, it looks for ways to escape from the latter.

Pikachu charges itself while sleeping overnight, though stress and a lack of sleep can affect this. It can release electric discharges of varying intensity. In the ''Pokémon the Series'' episode ''[[EP030|Sparks Fly for Magnemite]]'', Pikachu is shown to build up energy in its glands, which it will need to discharge to avoid complications. It is also able to release energy through its tail, which acts as a grounding rod, as well as recharge fellow Pikachu with electric shocks. Pikachu and its evolutionary relatives are related to {{p|Pachirisu}}. As shown in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Pikachu is known to generate electricity through its cheeks while sleeping. Pikachu discharges while sleeping due to it dreaming of firing electric shots.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref>

Pikachu and its evolutionary relatives are the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Volt Tackle}}. Pikachu is also the only known Pokémon capable of using the [[Z-Move]] {{m|Catastropika}}, and the only known Pokémon capable of using the [[Light Ball]] item.

===Forms===
Pikachu has sixteen additional forms that fall into four groups: [[Cosplay Pikachu]], [[Pikachu in a cap]], the {{OBP|Partner Pokémon|Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|partner}} Pikachu, and [[Gigantamax]] Pikachu. Additionally, many other [[Pikachu variants]] have appeared in various media.

====Cosplay Pikachu====
[[Cosplay Pikachu]] is always female, has a black heart-shaped spot at the end of its tail, and can be dressed in any of five outfits corresponding to the five [[Contest conditions]].

====Pikachu in a cap====
[[Pikachu in a cap]] is always male and has eight variants, each wearing one of [[Ash's hat]]s from ''[[Pokémon the Series]]''. Pikachu in a cap is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move {{m|10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt}}. Pikachu in a Cap cannot use {{m|Catastropika}} or Gigantamax.

====Partner Pikachu====
The {{OBP|Partner Pokémon|Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|partner}} Pikachu is the Pokémon the player starts with in {{LGPE|Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!}}. This Pikachu can be either gender. It has higher base stats than normal Pikachu. Unlike other Pikachu, the partner Pikachu can learn the exclusive moves {{m|Zippy Zap}}, {{m|Floaty Fall}}, and {{m|Splishy Splash}}, as well as having access to the [[Partner Pokémon (Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!)#Exclusive moves|Partner Power]] {{m|Pika Papow}}.

The partner Pikachu is not differentiated from standard Pikachu in {{LGPE}}'s Pokédex, and it cannot be transferred out of the games.

{{-}}

====Gigantamax Pikachu====
As Gigantamax Pikachu, it becomes larger and chubbier. Its tail becomes longer and becomes capable of storing all of the electricity it generates, causing it to glow a bright yellow and enabling it to become as powerful as a lightning strike. Three red clouds float around the tail. Its power is equal to that of a power plant; however, it is difficult to use it in peoples' homes since Pikachu can only remain in its Gigantamax form for a short time.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon-galar-region/gigantamax-pikachu/ Gigantamax Pikachu | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref> Gigantamax Pikachu is the only known Pokémon capable of using the [[G-Max Move]] {{m|G-Max Volt Crash}}.

===Evolution===
Pikachu evolves from {{p|Pichu}} and evolves into {{p|Raichu}}.

In [[Alola]], it evolves into {{rf|Alolan}} Raichu.

[[Cosplay Pikachu]], [[Pikachu in a cap]], {{OBP|Partner Pokémon|Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|Partner Pikachu}}, and Pikachu with the {{DL|Gigantamax|Gigantamax Factor}} cannot evolve.

==Game data==
===As the player===
{{main|Pikachu (PokéPark)}}
Pikachu appears as the [[player character]] in both [[PokéPark Wii: Pikachu's Adventure]] and its sequel, [[PokéPark 2: Wonders Beyond]]. He falls down a mysterious tunnel one day with his friends {{p|Charmander}}, {{p|Chikorita}}, and {{OBP|Piplup|PokéPark}} and ends up in the {{ga|PokéPark}}. There he goes on a quest to save the PokéPark from certain destruction. He later travels to a new PokéPark which is being threatened by the ever-expanding [[Wish Park]]. At the new PokéPark he meets {{p|Snivy}}, {{p|Tepig}}, and {{p|Oshawott}}, and they help to save the PokéPark from danger.

===NPC appearances===
====In the core series====
*These notable Trainers all use Pikachu:
**[[Lt. Surge]] uses a Pikachu in [[Pokémon Red and Green|Red, Green]], [[Pokémon Blue|Blue]], their [[Pokémon Red and Blue|international equivalents]], [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen|FireRed, and LeafGreen]].
**{{ga|Red}}, who makes NPC appearances in [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|Gold, Silver]], [[Pokémon Crystal|Crystal]], [[Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver|HeartGold, SoulSilver]], [[Pokémon Black 2 and White 2|Black 2, White 2]], [[Pokémon Sun and Moon|Sun, Moon]], [[Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|Ultra Sun, Ultra Moon]], [[Pokémon Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!]], owns a Pikachu, typically as his highest level Pokémon. Usually he represents the {{player}} from the Kanto-based games, particularly {{g|Yellow}} in which his first partner was a Pikachu. Pikachu does not evolve.
**[[Wattson]] uses a Pikachu exclusively to his second rematch in {{g|Emerald}}, in which all further battles have it replaced with a {{p|Raichu}}.
**[[Hau]]'s main partner in [[Pokémon Sun and Moon|Pokémon Sun, Moon]], [[Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon]] is a Pikachu, who eventually evolves into an {{rf|Alolan}} Raichu. It is first seen as a {{p|Pichu}}
**{{ga|Trace}}'s main partner in [[Pokémon Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|Pokémon Let's Go, Eevee!]] is a Pikachu, and eventually evolves into a Raichu.
**The player's [[friend]] in {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, either {{ga|Rei}} or {{ga|Akari}} (depending on the player's [[gender]]), will have a Pikachu. Pikachu does not evolve. Pikachu is seen as their main partner and will often appear outside its {{hi|Poké Ball}}.
**The [[Poké Kid]] Trainer Class is known to use Pikachu. In {{g|Sword and Shield}}, only the male Poké Kids use Pikachu.
**[[Ikue Ohtani]], the voice of Pikachu, makes appearance as a cameo in Gold, Silver, Crystal, HeartGold, SoulSilver (all as [[Picknicker]] Brooke), [[Pokémon X and Y|X, Y]] (as [[Breeder]] Mercy), and all [[Generation VII]] titles, where she all owns a Pikachu. In Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, Ikue is the Pikachu [[Master Trainer]].

====In the spin-offs====
* [[Pokémon Stadium]]: Pikachu stars in the mini-game "Thundering Dynamo" alongside {{p|Voltorb}}. This mini-game involves charging up electric power.
* [[Hey You, Pikachu!]]: Pikachu stars alongside an unnamed child (who bears a striking resemblance to {{ga|Red}}) who was recently taught how to interact with wild Pokémon by [[Professor Oak]]. The boy and Pikachu form a bond and go on many adventures together, and one day the Pikachu decides to live with the boy.
* {{g|Stadium 2}}: Pikachu can be used in "Pichu's Power Plant" if one is detected in a Transferred Pokémon game.
* {{g|Pinball}}: Pikachu serves as a Ball-Saver, but it will only work if the Lightning Meter is full.
* {{g|Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire}}: Pikachu has the same role as in Pokémon Pinball but is sometimes helped by {{p|Pichu}}. Pikachu also appears on the Catch 'Em Mode banner.
* {{g|Channel}}: Much like Hey You, Pikachu!, Pokémon Channel focuses on a boy and a Pikachu bonding through social interactions, such as going outside and talking to other Pokémon, and watching TV together.

===Held items===
Pokémon caught in [[Generation I]] must be traded to a [[Generation II]] game in order for a held item to appear. In {{game|Yellow}}, the player gets the [[Light Ball]] by trading the {{OBP|Pikachu|Yellow}} received at the beginning of the game, otherwise the Pikachu will be holding a Berry. In [[Pokéwalker]], only Pikachu found in [[Yellow Forest]] are carrying items.

===Form data===
Pikachu has sixteen additional forms that fall into four groups: [[Cosplay Pikachu]], [[Pikachu in a cap]], the {{OBP|Partner Pokémon|Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|partner}} Pikachu, and [[Gigantamax]] Pikachu. All forms except the partner Pikachu are recognized by an in-game Pokédex; partner Pikachu has only been named in promotional materials.<ref>[https://pokemonletsgo.pokemon.com/en-us/story/ Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! | Experience the World of Pokémon]</ref>

====Cosplay Pikachu====
[[Cosplay Pikachu]] is the base form of a group of six interchangeable forms exclusive to {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}. It is a [[Gender|female]] Pikachu who has a black, heart-shaped mark at the end of its tail, obtained from a {{tc|Pokémon Breeder}} after the player takes part in their first {{pkmn|Contest|Pokémon Contest Spectacular}}. Cosplay Pikachu can change forms by dressing up in different costumes corresponding to each of the five [[contest condition]]s ({{OBP|Cool|condition|Coolness}}, {{OBP|Beautiful|condition|Beauty}}, {{OBP|Cute|condition|Cuteness}}, {{OBP|Clever|condition|Cleverness}}, and {{OBP|Tough|condition|Toughness}}); each form also automatically learns a [[move]] that Pikachu otherwise could not learn. Cosplay Pikachu can change or remove its costume at any [[Contest Hall]], forgetting the move it learned with the last costume (if it still knows it) and learning the move from the new costume (if applicable). If Cosplay Pikachu removes its costume while the only move it knows is the move tied to its costume, it learns {{m|Thunder Shock}}.

Unlike other Pikachu, Cosplay Pikachu cannot [[Evolution|evolve]] or [[Pokémon breeding|breed]]. It also cannot be [[trade]]d via the [[Global Trade System|GTS]] or [[Wonder Trade]]. Additionally, as it is not present in any games besides Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, Cosplay Pikachu cannot be deposited into {{g|Bank}}, and it does not register as a separate form in Pokémon Bank's [[Pokédex]], despite it registering separately in the Pokédex of Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.

====Pikachu in a cap====
[[Pikachu in a cap]] are eight {{pkmn2|event}}-exclusive, non-interchangeable forms of Pikachu that debuted in {{g|Sun and Moon}}. Like [[Ash's Pikachu]], these Pikachu are always [[gender|male]], and they cannot [[Evolution|evolve]] or {{pkmn|breeding|breed}}. They are also able to use the event-exclusive [[Z-Crystal]] [[Pikashunium Z]] and its corresponding [[Z-Move]] {{m|10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt}}. Their [[cry|cries]] differ from that of regular Pikachu. They are not present in {{LGPE}}, [[Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl]], or [[Pokémon Legends: Arceus]].

Six variants exist in Pokémon Sun and Moon, one for each of [[Ash's hat]]s from the [[original series]] to {{aniseries|SM}}. A seventh variant debuted in {{g|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon}}, wearing the Partner Cap, Ash's hat from ''[[M20|Pokémon the Movie: I Choose You!]]''. An eighth variant debuted in the Version 1.2.0 update of {{g|Sword and Shield}}, wearing the World Cap, Ash's hat from {{aniseries|JN}}.

The original six Pikachu in a cap were distributed via [[serial code]]s in Pokémon Sun and Moon in celebration of the 20th [[Pokémon movie]], and by extension, the 20th anniversary of ''[[Pokémon the Series]]''. Partner Cap Pikachu was distributed in Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon via a [[QR Code]] that can be [[QR Scanner|scanned]]. All eight Pikachu in a cap (including World Cap Pikachu) were distributed via serial codes in Pokémon Sword and Shield to commemorate the TV show's [[JN040|timeslot change]] to Fridays in Japan; uniquely, the Pikachu from this distribution can learn {{m|Volt Tackle}} from the [[Move Reminder]].

</div>

====Partner Pikachu====
The {{OBP|Partner Pokémon|Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|partner}} Pikachu has a separate [[List of Pokémon by index number in Generation VII|internal index]] from standard Pikachu. This allows it to have higher [[base stats]] than wild Pikachu.

The partner Pikachu is not differentiated from standard Pikachu in {{LGPE}}'s Pokédex, and it cannot be transferred out of the games.

[[Cosplay Pikachu]], [[Pikachu in a cap]], the {{OBP|Partner Pokémon|Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|partner}} Pikachu, and Pikachu with the [[Gigantamax Factor]] cannot evolve. The {{OBP|Pikachu|Yellow}} received at the beginning of {{game|Yellow}} will refuse to evolve into Raichu unless it is traded and evolved on another save file.

{{Ash}} has a Pikachu that he obtained from {{an|Professor Oak}} in ''[[EP001|Pokémon - I Choose You!]]'', the first episode of {{aniseries|PTS}}, which also marked its debut.

=====[[Pikachutwo]]=====
In ''[[M01|Mewtwo Strikes Back]]'', {{OBP|Mewtwo|M01}} cloned Ash's Pikachu. This Pikachu can be distinguished from Ash's due to the spikes in the black marks found on the tips of its ears. It is also comparatively more aggressive than Ash's Pikachu and slurs its speech, defects possibly caused by Ash tampering with Mewtwo's cloning machine during the cloning process. It reappeared in the sequel special ''[[Mewtwo Returns]]'' and the remake movie ''[[M22|Mewtwo Strikes Back—Evolution]]''.

==In the TCG==
[[File:PikachuBaseSet58.jpg|200px|thumb|Pikachu in the TCG]]
[[File:GBML Bronze Pikachu Coin.png|thumb|100px|left|Pikachu TCG Coin]]
{{main|Pikachu (TCG)}}
Pikachu manages to find its way into many of the expansions, causing there to be {{#expr: {{PAGESINCATEGORY:Pikachu (TCG)}} - 1}} known non-reprint Pokémon cards featuring Pikachu. There are also various Trainer cards with Pikachu in the card's artwork too, including the very sought-after tournament promos such as {{OBP|No.1 Trainer|Tournament promo}}.

The first Pikachu that appeared in the TCG was {{TCG ID|Base Set|Pikachu|58}} in the {{TCG|Base Set}} (which was reprinted in {{TCG|Base Set 2}} and in {{TCG|POP Series 2}} with different artwork). It was followed in {{TCG|Jungle|the next set}} by another {{TCG ID|Jungle|Pikachu|60}} (which was also reprinted in the {{TCG|Legendary Collection}}). The third Pikachu card released was the first-ever English {{TCG|Wizards Black Star Promos|promo card}}, {{TCG ID|Wizards Promo|Pikachu|1}}. The original Base Set Pikachu was also released as a special promotional card at {{wp|E3}}.

In the early days of the TCG, several notable errors were made regarding the Pikachu cards. The Base Set Pikachu was released with altered artwork at first, depicting it with red cheeks, instead of the original yellow. While this matched [[Ken Sugimori]]'s artwork, the yellow color on its cheeks was intentional by the artist, who depicted Pikachu using {{m|ThunderShock}}. This error appeared in both the E3 promotional version and the normal Base Set release. A second error was made in the production of Jungle set booster packs, which, instead of the Jungle set's Pikachu, sometimes contained first edition versions of the Pikachu that was released as a promo card.

Pikachu has also been featured on a number of TCG {{TCG|coin}}s, with one being included with the English and European languages-only {{tcg|Base Set 2}}. This coin was also featured in the {{g|Play It!}} PC game. A Pikachu coin is also featured in the [[Game Boy]] game {{vg|Pokémon Trading Card Game}}, and is one of the coins that can be obtained in {{g|Trading Card Game 2: The Invasion of Team GR!}}, where it is given by {{TCG GB|Isaac}} to winners of the [[Lightning Club]].

==In the TFG==
Two Pikachu figures have been released.
* {{TFG|Next Quest}}: {{TFG ID|Next Quest|Pikachu|18}}

==={{OBP|Detective Pikachu|video game}}===
Detective Pikachu stars a {{OBP|Detective Pikachu|character|Pikachu}} that is [[Talking Pokémon|capable of speaking the human language]], but only the player character [[Tim Goodman]] is capable of hearing him. Much like {{MTR}} from ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'', he is incapable of using moves that most Pikachu are capable of using. This Pikachu also really loves to drink coffee. Early on in the game, a regular Pikachu also briefly appears.

==Trivia==
* Pikachu and its evolved form both share their {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Rattata}}, {{p|Raticate}}, {{p|Sandshrew}}, {{p|Sandslash}}, {{p|Pawmi}}, and {{p|Pawmo}}. They are all known as the Mouse Pokémon, though Rattata and Raticate were originally called the Rat Pokémon prior to [[Generation III]].
* [[Veronica Taylor]] has said Pikachu is her favorite {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. [[Sarah Natochenny]] has as well, shared with {{p|Mew}}.
* In [[Generation VIII]] onwards, Pikachu is capable of learning {{m|Surf}} via [[TM]], when it was previously only obtainable through special means.
* Pikachu is the only Pokémon that serves as the [[List of the player's first Pokémon|player's first Pokémon]] in the [[core series]] games that has a pre-evolved form. However, {{p|Pichu}} (its pre-evolved form) does not exist in either game in which it fills this role.
* Pikachu has the most {{pkmn2|event}}-exclusive [[move]]s available to it.
* Pikachu is the only Pokémon with two exclusive [[Z-Move]]s.
* When starting a [[new game]] in {{game|Yellow}}, Pikachu's front sprite appears with a slightly different [[List of color palettes by index number in Generation I|color palette]] (the palette index number 0x10) than usual when it is introduced by [[Professor Oak]]. This is the same red/yellow palette used for {{p|Mew}}, {{p|Mewtwo}}, and {{p|Jynx}} (except the [[Virtual Console]] Jynx), as well as the battle sprites of all [[Pokémon Trainer]]s.
** Due to the color palette used at the start of Pokémon Yellow, Pikachu has red cheeks (in the [[Game Boy Color]]) or pink cheeks (in the [[Super Game Boy]]). However, in this game's normal gameplay, Pikachu has dark orange cheeks instead.
* In {{game|Yellow}} and from [[Generation VI]] to {{pkmn|Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl}}, Pikachu uses its {{pkmn|animated series}} [[cry]] ([[Voice acting in the Pokémon games|voiced]] by [[Ikue Otani]]). Before Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, it was the only Pokémon to do so in the core series games.
** Its battle cry differs from status or Pokédex screens.
** The {{OBP|Pikachu|Yellow}} received at the beginning of {{game|Yellow}} has unique [[Voice acting in the Pokémon games|voice clips]] in [[Pokémon Stadium]] and {{pkmn|Stadium 2}}.
** From {{g|Legends: Arceus}} onward, Pikachu's cry switched to a slightly modified version of its pre-Gen VI cry.
* Pikachu is the only core series first partner Pokémon that does not have a 7:1 gender ratio.
* {{game4|BWB2W2}} are the only core series games in which Pikachu cannot be obtained without transporting or through an event.
* Pikachu is the only not fully evolved Pokémon whose [[base stats]] increased in Generation VI, as well as the only Pokémon to receive more than one stat increase: Defense and Special Defense.
* Pikachu is the 25th Pokémon in both the [[National Pokédex]] and [[List of Pokémon by Alola Pokédex number in Pokémon Sun and Moon|Alola Pokédex]] in {{g|Sun and Moon}}.
* In the Japanese {{jpn|Pokémon Stadium}}, Pikachu is the only usable Pokémon that is not fully [[Evolution|evolved]].
* Pikachu is the only Pokémon that can be caught in all three pinball titles: {{g|Pinball}}, {{g|Pinball mini}}, and {{g|Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire}}.
* According to ''[[A Sneak Peek at Pokémon]]'', Pikachu can deliver a constant current of 1000 {{wp|ampere}}s.
* Pikachu is currently represented in the {{pkmn|Trading Card Game}} by more cards than any other Pokémon, with {{#expr: {{PAGESINCATEGORY:Pikachu (TCG)}} - 1}} unique cards.

===Merchandise===
[[File:Pikachu Red Battle Chess.png|thumb|Pikachu in Pokémon Battle Chess]]
* Pikachu appears in {{DL|Pokémon Battle Chess|Pokémon Battle Chess}}. It doesn't behave like any traditional piece in chess but behaves like a gold general in shogi.
* Pikachu was the focus of a {{OBP|Pokémon Center|store}} [[Sleeping Pikachu Collection|collection]] in June 2014.

===Real life===
* The {{wp|Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade}} has included three Pikachu balloons. "Flying Pikachu" was the first, flown from 2001 to 2005, and was used in a morning rush hour test of wind conditions in {{wp|Times Square}} after an accident involving an {{wp|M&M's}} balloon in the 2005 parade.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/23/nyregion/23balloon.html?_r=0 Pikachu Soars as Trial Balloon for a Safer Macy's Parade - New York Times]</ref> It was last used in the August 2006 {{pkmn|10th Anniversary|Party of the Decade}} in New York City's {{wp|Bryant Park}}. The second balloon debuted in the 2006 parade, features glowing cheeks, and chases a {{i|Poké Ball}} balloon. The third, introduced in the 2014 parade, wears a green scarf and holds a small, Pikachu-shaped snowman.

===Cultural impact===
[[File:Niue Dollar Pikachu.jpg|thumb|200px|$1 coin from {{wp|Niue}} featuring Pikachu]]
* The nation of {{wp|Niue}} released a one-dollar coin with its coat of arms on one side and Pikachu on the other to promote the [[Pokémon]] franchise.
* Pikachu has served as [[List of references to Pokémon in science|the inspiration for the naming]] of several scientific discoveries:
** In 2008, Japanese researchers discovered a new protein that helps carry electrical impulses from the eyes to the brain and named it {{wp|pikachurin}}. According to them, it was so named for sharing Pikachu's "lightning-fast moves and shocking electric effects".
** The {{wp|springtail}} species ''Dicranocentrus pikachu'' was named after Pikachu.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20220928170630/https://brill.com/view/journals/ise/49/1/article-p23_23.xml New species and new records of Dicranocentrus Schött, 1893 (Collembola: Entomobryidae) from Southeastern Brazil]</ref>
** The spider species ''Epicratinus pikachu'' was named after Pikachu due to the female spider's {{wp|Epigyne|epigynum}} resembling its face.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20201209091240/https://www.biotaxa.org/Zootaxa/article/view/zootaxa.4886.1.1 Taxonomic review and cladistic analysis of Neotropical spider genus Epicratinus Jocqué & Baert, 2005 (Araneae: Zodariidae) with description of eleven new species]</ref>
** The spider species ''Alistra pikachu'' was named after Pikachu due to its yellow coloration.<ref name="yejie lin">[https://web.archive.org/web/20230309124205/https://www.zootax.com.cn/CN/abstract/abstract296.shtml Twenty-three new spider species (Arachnida: Araneae) from Asia]</ref>
** The beetle species ''Hiperantha pikachu'' was named after Pikachu because of its yellow elytra with a black apical band that resembles Pikachu's ears.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20220525023625/https://mapress.com/zt/article/view/zootaxa.5082.1.4 Notes on Stigmoderini (Coleoptera, Buprestidae) from Brazil, with the description of a new species of Hiperantha Gistel, 1834, and new distributional records]</ref>
* On December 11, 2023, {{wp|Google}} revealed that Pikachu was the "most searched Pokémon" in the platform's history during its 25 years of creation.<ref>https://twitter.com/Google/status/1734218344402743791</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KtWfp0UopM&pp=ygUPZ29vZ2xlIDI1IHllYXJz</ref>

===Concept and development===
Pikachu was designed by [[Atsuko Nishida]], a core designer at [[Game Freak]].<ref>[http://www.natsume.com/news/news_pdffiles/pid_129_HSBigNames0806.pdf Natsume: THE TALENT BEHIND HOMETOWN STORY]</ref><ref name=Pokemon.com /> Pikachu had a short, stout design during the initial release of {{g|Red and Green}}, but its design was altered for ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' and subsequent entries of the games, becoming slightly taller and skinnier. According to [[Ken Sugimori]], Pikachu's design was altered to make animating its actions easier.<ref name=Pokemon.com /> Pikachu is depicted with a white belly similar to its evolved form {{p|Raichu}} in the [[Bandai Pokémon Carddass Cards]] {{file|Bandai Pikachu card.jpg|as seen here}}.

Pikachu also originally had a second-stage [[Evolution]] named "[[List of unused Pokémon and character designs#Gorochu|Gorochu]]" (Japanese: '''ゴロチュウ''' ''Gorochū''), which would have had two horns and fangs.<ref>[https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/fukayomi/20180501-OYT8T50139/3/ Page 3 of Yomiuri interview] with [[Ken Sugimori]], [[Kōji Nishino]], and [[Atsuko Nishida]] (Japanese)</ref><ref name=SiliconEra>''[https://www.siliconera.com/pikachu-originally-second-evolution-called-gorochu-large-fangs-two-horns/ Pikachu Originally Had A Second Evolution Called ‘Gorochu’ With Large Fangs And Two Horns]'' — SiliconEra</ref> Sugimori stated that while there was nothing wrong with its appearance, it was nonetheless omitted from Pokémon Red and Green, as the staff found that the game balance was better without it, and the limited game space meant that some Pokémon originally designed to evolve twice were changed to evolve only once.<ref name=Pokemon.com>[https://web.archive.org/web/20211108083831/https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/creator-profile-the-creators-of-pikachu/ Creator Profile: The Creators of Pikachu - Pokemon.com] (archived)</ref>

Gigantamax Pikachu was designed by [[James Turner]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/JamesTurner_42/status/1559091292889497602 Tweet by James Turner (@JamesTurner_42).] Posted on August 15, 2022.</ref>

===Origin===
Pikachu was originally a {{wp|daifuku}}-like creature with ears sticking out. Its black ear tips are remnants of this original concept.<ref name=Pokemon.com /><ref name=SiliconEra>''[https://www.siliconera.com/pikachu-originally-second-evolution-called-gorochu-large-fangs-two-horns/ Pikachu Originally Had A Second Evolution Called ‘Gorochu’ With Large Fangs And Two Horns]'' — SiliconEra</ref>

Nishida named the Pokémon Pikachu "without giving it much thought", and while it wasn't originally intended to be based on a {{wp|mouse}}, [[Game Freak]] CEO [[Satoshi Tajiri]] made the decision to base it on such. During the process of making Pikachu "cuter", as per the instructions of game designer [[Kōji Nishino]], Nishida added cheek pouches for it to store electricity in. These were inspired by {{wp|squirrel}}s, which store food in their cheeks. Pikachu's yellow coloration and lightning bolt-shaped tail were given to express Pikachu's electrical attributes and make its type easier to recognise and understand. According to Nishida, Pikachu's stripes aren't based on anything in particular, and were added to fill the empty space on Pikachu's back, as it is always visible during battle.<ref name=Pokemon.com /><ref name=SiliconEra />

Pikachu's [[Gigantamax]] form is a reference to its earlier, more rotund design from [[Generation I|Generations I]] and {{gen|II}}.<ref name=Chunkachu>[https://twitter.com/JamesTurner_42/status/1559317105798811648 Tweet by James Turner (@JamesTurner_42).] Posted on August 15, 2022.</ref>

====Name origin====
Pikachu is a combination of ピカピカ ''pikapika'' ({{wp|onomatopoeia}} for sparkle) and チューチュー ''chūchū'' (the sound of a mouse squeaking).<ref name=Pokemon.com /><ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/ASIANOW/time/magazine/99/1122/pokemon6.fullinterview2.html TIME - The Ultimate Game Freak]</ref>
