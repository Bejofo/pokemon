'''Raichu''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ライチュウ''' ''Raichu'') is an {{type|Electric}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Pikachu}} when exposed to a [[Thunder Stone]]. It is the final form of {{p|Pichu}}.

In [[Alola]], Raichu has a dual-type {{2t|Electric|Psychic}} [[regional form]]. It evolves from Pikachu when exposed to a Thunder Stone. All Pikachu in Alola will evolve into this form regardless of their origin. It is the final form of Pichu in the Alola region.

Raichu will be able to [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Raichu X''' using the [[Raichunite X]] and '''Mega Raichu Y''' using the [[Raichunite Y]] in the [[Mega Dimension]] DLC for the upcoming {{g|Legends: Z-A}}.

==Biology==
Raichu is a bipedal, {{wp|rodent}}-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. Even though it's classified as bipedal, Raichu usually get around on all fours. Raichu is covered in dark orange fur with a white belly. Its bifurcated ears are brown on the outside, yellow on the insides, and end in a distinctive curl. There is a circular yellow marking on each cheek where its electric sacs are, and it has a triangular, dark brown nose. Its arms and feet have patches of brown fur at the end, and the soles of its long feet are tan with a circular orange pad in the center. On its back are two horizontal brown stripes. Its long, thin tail has a lightning bolt-shaped end. The tip of this lightning bolt is chipped on females. Raichu exudes a weak electrical charge from its body and glows slightly in the dark.

Raichu's tail is used to gather electricity from the atmosphere, or it can be planted in the ground to search for electricity. It also protects Raichu from its high-voltage power. Raichu can store over 100,000 volts of electricity, enough to knock out a {{p|Copperajah}}. If Raichu's sacs are fully charged, its ears will stand straight up, and its muscles will become stimulated. However, it will become aggressive if it has stored too much electricity and stress. To prevent it from reaching this state, it discharges electricity through its tail into the ground. This leads to scorched patches near its nest. Being the result of Evolution via [[Evolution stone]], Raichu is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Forest Pokémon|forests and woodlands}}. The main reason Raichu is rarely seen with Pokémon trainers is because people prefer the look it had as {{p|Pikachu}}. As revealed in the ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' episode ''[[EP014|Electric Shock Showdown]]'', Raichu is not capable of learning speed attacks upon evolving and can only learn them when they're still Pikachu. As shown in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Raichu is known to sleep while discharging electricity, and a long tail is planted into the ground like a rod. It can electrocute anyone who comes near it while sleeping.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref>

Raichu and its pre-evolved forms are the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Volt Tackle}}.

===Forms===
Raichu has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Alolan}} Raichu and two [[Mega Evolution]]s, Mega Raichu X and Mega Raichu Y.

;Alolan Raichu
In [[Alola]], Raichu has lighter coloring and more rounded features. Its eyes are blue with yellow half-circles along the bottom. It has large yellow ears with an inner spiral toward the base and brown on the inside. These ears are thicker and less pointed than a standard Raichu's ear. In addition to its white belly, {{rf|Alolan}} Raichu has white markings on its paws with bright yellow lines between its digits. The stripes on its back have also turned white, and there is a small, white circular marking on each heel. The lightning bolt-shaped tip of its tail has rounded edges. By collecting its psychic power in its tail, it can ride it like a {{wp|surfboard}} and float in the air. While its cheek sacs are still used to store electricity, rubbing them releases a sweet aroma while also getting a light shock. This is also thought to be connected to its Psychic abilities.

Alolan Raichu's origins were initially a mystery at the time. The people of Alola suggested it ate too many sweet and fluffy pancakes,<ref>[http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/alolan-raichu/ Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Alolan Raichu]</ref> especially those made with a secret Alolan recipe. However, researchers believe the change is related to Alolan Raichu's diet in general. It is also believed the weather and climate of the [[Alola]] region played a role in the transformation. Alolan Raichu is capable of unleashing star-shaped thunderbolts. It is also known by the name ''hodad''. While normally found in [[Alola]], it has been seen in the [[Coastal Biome]] of the [[Terarium]] during rare [[mass outbreak]] [[Poké Portal News|events]].

Alolan Raichu is the only known Pokémon capable of using the [[Z-Move]] {{m|Stoked Sparksurfer}}. It is also the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Surge Surfer}} as an [[Ability]].

;Mega Raichu X
[[File:Raichu Mega Evolution X.png|thumb|left|x180px|Mega Raichu X using electricity]]
As Mega Raichu X, it takes on a color scheme reminiscent of {{p|Pikachu}} with its red cheeks and bright yellow fur, but its overall appearance retains a distinctive resemblance to Kantonian Raichu.<ref name=ZAsite>(September 12, 2025). [https://legends.pokemon.com/en-gb/news/mega-dimension-hoopa The Mythical Pokémon Hoopa Holds the Key to the Story] — Pokémon Official Website</ref> Its original brown eyes have become red. Its tail has split into two identical tails, which are similar in shape to Pikachu's tail, except for the zig-zagging black fur coloration at the base of each tail. Both of its arms and ears are much larger. The yellow insides of its ears are gone, and its ears now sport a solid black color with golden tips. It also now has a noticeable fang-like left {{wp|canine tooth}}. When using electricity, its cheeks and its tails glow brightly. Its appearance while levitating resembles the letter X.

Mega Raichu X's tails generate electromagnetic force, creating enough repulsion for it to float and propel itself swiftly in the air. It focuses its electric power into its fists as its primary method of attack, allowing it to down much larger foes in one strike. It has ample subcutaneous fat which stores up electricity, augmenting its defenses and allowing it to maintain a high electrical output.<ref name=ZAsite/>
{{left clear}}

;Mega Raichu Y
[[File:Raichu Mega Evolution Y.png|thumb|left|x180px|Mega Raichu Y using electricity]]
As Mega Raichu Y, it takes on an appearance distinctly resembling Pikachu,<ref name=ZAsite/> but it retains its original color scheme as regular Raichu with its yellow cheeks and orange fur. Its original brown eyes have become blue, and the lightning bolt-shaped tip of its tail is enlarged. The patches of brown fur at the ends of its arms and feet are now gone, as well as the yellow insides of its ears, which now sport a solid orange color with black tips. A pair of horn-like yellow protrusions made of fur jut out of its ears, resembling a pair of lightning bolts. The ends of these "horns" have the distinctive curls found on the ears of regular Raichu. Additionally, Mega Raichu Y now has two prominent {{wp|Canine tooth|canines}}. When using electricity, its cheeks and horn-like fur glow brightly; in key artwork for [[Mega Dimension]], Mega Raichu Y's teeth are also shown glowing. Its appearance with its tail extended resembles the letter Y.

Mega Raichu Y can generate even stronger electricity in larger quantities using the sacs on its cheeks. When it does so, the energy is amplified, coursing in a zig-zag pattern between its tail and "horns". Amassing so much electricity gives Mega Raichu Y a wild and combative temperament, and it prefers a straightforward approach to battling as opposed to performing tactical maneuvers. This also because its greatest strength is its ability to unleash this energy instantaneously, making it excel in short, decisive battles.<ref name=ZAsite/>

An Alolan Raichu that knew the move {{m|Volt Tackle}} in [[Generation VII]] and transferred in via {{g|Bank}} and {{g|HOME}} can be retaught the move using the Pokémon HOME [[Pokémon_HOME#Move_Reminder|move reminder]] functionality. This is the only way for Alolan Raichu to know the move in {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}. An Alolan Raichu knowing the move is blocked from online trades and can not be used in [[Battle Stadium]].

===Main series===
====Major appearances====
=====[[Lt. Surge's Raichu]]=====
In ''[[EP014|Electric Shock Showdown]]'', [[Lt. Surge]] has a Raichu that defeated [[Ash's Pikachu]] with its sheer power during {{Ash}}'s [[Gym]] {{pkmn|battle}}. After unsuccessfully discussing the prospect of [[Evolution]] with Pikachu to match Raichu's power, Ash used a strategy relying on Pikachu's speed to defeat Raichu during a [[rematch]] the next day.

=====[[Goh's Raichu]]=====
In ''[[JN035|Gotta Catch a'' ''What?!]]'', a female Pikachu that was newly {{pkmn2|caught}} by [[Goh]] evolved into Raichu by using a [[Thunder Stone]].

=====Other=====
In ''[[PK01|Pikachu's Vacation]]'', a Raichu caused trouble for {{AP|Pikachu}} and his friends at the [[Pokémon Theme Park]], alongside a {{p|Marill}}, {{p|Snubbull}}, and {{p|Cubone}}.

In ''[[EP069|Lights, Camera, Quack-tion]]'', {{OBP|Katrina|EP069}} decided to use her Raichu, nicknamed Raichie, in the [[Cleavon Schpielbunk]] film "{{DL|Movies in the Pokémon world|Pokémon in Love}}".

In ''[[EP090|Stage Fight!]]'', [[Kay]]'s Raichu was a part a {{pkmn|Showboat|stage show}} that featured "{{pkmn2|talking}}" Pokémon, but it had stage fright and was very timid around others due to an incident where it startled Kay with its electricity when they first met. Raichu eventually gained back its confidence around Kay and helped defeat Team Rocket.

In ''[[EP139|Mild 'n Wooly]]'', [[Ellen]] commonly used a Raichu to round up a herd of {{p|Mareep}} with its {{m|Thunderbolt}}.

==Trivia==
<!--Do not add "hodad" as an alternate name for Alolan Raichu. It is merely a nickname, unlike "Keokeo" for Alolan Vulpix.-->
* No other {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} has the same [[type]] [[List of Pokémon with unique type combinations|combination]] as Alolan Raichu.
* In {{game|Red and Blue|s}}, there is a {{tc|Scientist}} at the [[Cinnabar Lab|Pokémon Lab]] in [[Cinnabar Island]] who will [[trade]] a Raichu for an {{p|Electrode}}. If the player talks to him after the trade, he will mention that the Raichu evolved, which is not possible. This mistake was due to the original translation of the script of the {{jpn|Pokémon Blue Version|Japanese Blue}} (in which this person traded a Graveler for a Kadabra) rather than that of {{game|Red and Green|s}}. This error was corrected in {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}}, as the script was re-translated.
* Raichu's FireRed and Sun Pokédex entries discuss Raichu's electricity being able to knock out an Indian elephant. In {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, this is changed to {{p|Copperajah}}, which is based on the Indian elephant.
** This is also the only Pokédex entry in Legends: Arceus to mention a Pokémon not obtainable in [[Hisui]].
* Several Pokédex entries claim Raichu can discharge up to {{m|Thunderbolt|100,000 volts}}. However, its Stadium entry claims it can only discharge up to 10,000 volts. This is likely a translation error due to the way numbers are read in Japanese, where 100,000 literally reads "ten ten-thousands".
* Although {{p|Pikachu}} is the [[first partner Pokémon]] of {{game|Yellow}}, it is not possible to directly evolve it into Raichu in the game, and must be traded in from {{2v2|Red|Blue}}. This inability to evolve Pikachu is a reference to [[Ash's Pikachu]] in ''[[Pokémon the Series]]''.
* Raichu and its pre-evolved form both share their {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Rattata}}, {{p|Raticate}}, {{p|Sandshrew}}, {{p|Sandslash}}, {{p|Pawmi}}, and {{p|Pawmo}}. They are all known as the Mouse Pokémon, though Rattata and Raticate were originally called the Rat Pokémon prior to [[Generation III]].
* Raichu is the 26th Pokémon in both the [[National Pokédex]] and [[List of Pokémon by Alola Pokédex number in Pokémon Sun and Moon|Alola Pokédex]] in {{g|Sun and Moon}}.
* Alolan Raichu is the only [[regional form]] Pokémon to have a [[Z-Move]] exclusive to it, {{m|Stoked Sparksurfer}}.
* Raichu is the most common Pokémon found amongst [[rival]]s, being used by five of them.
* Alolan Raichu is the only [[Alolan form]] available in {{g|Scarlet and Violet}} that can only be obtained by transferring from other games, outside of [[Poké Portal News]] events.
* Raichu is the first Pokémon to have a [[Mega Evolution]] added through DLC expansion.
* Raichu and {{p|Slowbro}} are the only Pokémon to have both a Mega Evolution and a regional form.
* Raichu, between its regular and Alolan forms, is the only Pokémon to have access to both Mega Evolution and an exclusive [[Z-Move]].
* Raichu is the only Pokémon with two Mega Evolutions:
** To not have them released in {{g|X and Y}}.
** To not have them be [[version-exclusive Pokémon]].
** Whose types are the same across the three [[form]]s.
* Mega Raichu X and Mega Raichu Y were the last Mega Evolutions to be revealed in promotional trailers before the release of {{g|Legends: Z-A}}, along with the Mega-Evolved forms of the fully evolved [[Kalos first partner Pokémon]].

===Concept and development===
Raichu and {{rf|Alolan}} Raichu were designed by [[Atsuko Nishida]].<ref name=USUM>"What It Takes to Create a Pokémon." Interview with Ken Sugimori in ''[[Pokémon Ultra Sun & Pokémon Ultra Moon Edition: The Official National Pokédex]]'', p. xxi</ref> The concept of Alolan Raichu came from [[Masafumi Nukita]], which also involved writing its [[Pokédex entry|Pokédex entries]].<ref>https://archive.is/tS5lL</ref>

Raichu originally had an evolved form named "[[List of unused Pokémon and character designs#Gorochu|Gorochu]]" (Japanese: '''ゴロチュウ''' ''Gorochū''), which would have had two horns and fangs.<ref>[https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/fukayomi/20180501-OYT8T50139/3/ Page 3 of Yomiuri interview] with [[Ken Sugimori]], [[Kōji Nishino]], and [[Atsuko Nishida]] (Japanese)</ref><ref>''[https://www.siliconera.com/pikachu-originally-second-evolution-called-gorochu-large-fangs-two-horns/ Pikachu Originally Had A Second Evolution Called ‘Gorochu’ With Large Fangs And Two Horns]'' — SiliconEra</ref> [[Ken Sugimori]] stated that while there was nothing wrong with its appearance, it was nonetheless omitted from {{game|Red and Green|s}}, as the staff found that the game balance was better without it, and the limited game space meant that some Pokémon originally designed to evolve twice were changed to evolve only once.<ref name=Pokemon.com>[https://web.archive.org/web/20211108083831/https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/creator-profile-the-creators-of-pikachu/ Creator Profile: The Creators of Pikachu - Pokemon.com] (archived)</ref>

===Origin===
Raichu's legs and long tail resemble those of a {{wp|jerboa}} or {{wp|kangaroo rat}}.

{{rf|Alolan}} Raichu may be based on the concept of [[surfing Pikachu]] and the sport of {{wp|surfing}} itself, which originated in and is the state sport of {{wp|Hawaii}} (the inspiration for the [[Alola]] [[region]]), as well as the [[wiktionary:hodad|hodad]] concept of being a fake surfer; ''hodad'' is referred to as another name for Alolan Raichu in its [[Pokédex]] entry in {{pkmn|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|Pokémon Ultra Sun}}. Its design and {{t|Psychic}} type may have been influenced by [[Puka]], a surfing Pikachu that appeared in {{aniseries|PTS}} which had psychic powers and blue eyes. In the {{g|Stadium series}}, {{pkmn|Colosseum}}, {{XD}}, and {{pkmn|Battle Revolution}}, Raichu rides on its tail when using the move {{m|Surf}}.

According to [[Ken Sugimori]], he asked [[Atsuko Nishida]] to design Alolan Raichu since she was the one who had worked on the original Raichu design. Nishida insisted that Raichu "has always been cuter than people might think", and designed Alolan Raichu to emphasize Raichu's cuteness; in particular, she designed it with the motif of {{wp|bread}}. The in-game lore of people believing that its [[Evolution]] is induced by eating pancakes was added afterward to play up the concept.<ref name=USUM/> The fact that Alolan Raichu was designed after bread may have also inspired the sweet fragrance it can release from its cheeks, as well as the look of its paws which resemble {{wp|whipped cream}} decorations, {{wp|cream puff}}s, or ''{{wp|baozi}}''.

Both Mega Raichu X and Mega Raichu Y resemble their assigned letters, and also seem to take elements from {{p|Pikachu}}'s design, such as its color and the shape of its body and tail. Mega Raichu X takes after regular Raichu, with its color scheme and tail shape potentially being inspired by Pikachu. Mega Raichu Y appears to be the inverse, taking heavy inspiration from Pikachu,<ref>"It bears a distinctive resemblance to {{p|Pikachu}}." - [https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/news/mega-dimension-hoopa The Mythical Pokémon Hoopa Holds the Key to the Story] {{g|Legends: Z-A}} official website</ref> while retaining the colors and tail shape of Raichu. Old media has also portrayed Pikachu as having a circular spot on its belly, a feature that Raichu has in all its [[form]]s. They could also be inspired by the scrapped Gorochu species, as Gorochu was described as having fangs and two horns; both Mega-Evolved forms of Raichu have fangs, and Mega Raichu Y is mentioned to have horn-like fur.

====Name origin====
Raichu may be a combination of 雷 ''rai'' (thunder) and チューチュー ''chūchū'' (onomatopoeia for the squeak of a mouse).
