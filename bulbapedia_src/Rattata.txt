'''Rattata''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''コラッタ''' ''Koratta'') is a {{type|Normal}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s into {{p|Raticate}} starting at [[level]] 20.

In [[Alola]], Rattata has a dual-type {{2t|Dark|Normal}} [[regional form]]. It evolves into {{rf|Alolan}} Raticate when [[level]]ed up at [[Time-based Evolution|night]] starting at level 20.

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for these details.)

It is the player's [[List of the player's first Pokémon#Pokémon Rumble series|first]] [[Toy Pokémon]] in [[Pokémon Rumble]] and [[Pokémon Rumble Rush]].

==Biology==
Rattata is a small, quadrupedal {{wp|rodent}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. It has purple fur with a cream-colored face, paws, and underbelly. It has narrow eyes containing white sclera and pupil with red irises, rounded ears with cream-colored insides, and a single whisker on each cheek. Its long tail is tightly curled at the end. Its most notable feature is its large teeth. Like most rodents, its teeth grow continuously throughout its life and must be worn down by gnawing. This also ensures that Rattata is not awoken by the sound of its grinding teeth while sleeping. Females will have shorter whiskers.

Rattata can live wherever it can find food, which it searches for most of the day. Thanks to its sharp fangs, it is able to chew on nearly anything. When it is threatened, Rattata can deliver a powerful bite. Rattata constantly keep their ears up and will immediately scurry away from the slightest sound. {{p|Furret}} is the natural predator of Rattata. Its hardiness lets it live in many environments, although it mainly lives on {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|plains and savannas}}. Because it reproduces so quickly, a pair of Rattata can quickly colonize an area. As shown in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Rattata is known to sleep sometimes with a log in its mouth.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref>

Prior to [[Generation IV]], Rattata and its evolved form, {{p|Raticate}}, were the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the moves {{m|Hyper Fang}} and {{m|Super Fang}}.

===Forms===
[[File:Alolan Rattata SM concept art.jpg|thumb|left|{{rf|Alolan}} Rattata in its {{pkmn|Sun and Moon}} concept art, shown standing on its hind legs and grouping near Alolan {{p|Raticate}}]]
Rattata has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Alolan}} Rattata.

Due to territory disputes with the Yungoos line, Rattata has taken on a new appearance. It has dark gray fur and grayish-purple ear insides. There are two tufts of fur on each ear and near the tip of its tail. Its long, thin whiskers are also replaced by shorter, thicker tufts of fur. The line where its cream underbelly meets its gray fur is ragged instead of smooth. Unlike its Kantonian form, it often stands on its hind legs, giving it a more bipedal appearance.

Rattata are non-native to [[Alola]] and arrived in cargo ships. The Rattata population in Alola was booming until {{p|Yungoos}} and {{p|Gumshoos}} were imported as a control measure. In order to avoid these new predators, Rattata altered its habits. It moved to more urban areas, became nocturnal, and formed large nests led by {{p|Raticate}}.<ref>[http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/alolan-rattata/ Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Alolan Rattata]</ref> Each nest has an Alolan Raticate serving as their boss.

Alolan Rattata searches out fresh food by smell and ignores anything spoiled. The whiskers provide Alolan Rattata with a keen sense of smell, allowing it to find hidden food instantly. Humans are known to use Alolan Rattata when they go shopping for fresh food.

Alolan Rattata are more active when the sun sets. Alolan Rattata will search for food in order to give to their boss. It has even been known to sneak into people's homes to find food. They use their whiskers to locate the food in said homes. There have been massive outbreak in Alola due to this. As a result, Alola Rattata has become an issue of public concern for humans.

==Trivia==
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Rattata was originally known as ''Rattatak''.
* Rattata is notorious for being associated with the [[Appendix:F.E.A.R.|F.E.A.R.]] strategy.
* Rattata and its evolved form both share their {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Pikachu}}, {{p|Raichu}}, {{p|Sandshrew}}, {{p|Sandslash}}, {{p|Pawmi}}, and {{p|Pawmo}}. They are all known as the Mouse Pokémon, though Rattata and {{p|Raticate}} were originally called the Rat Pokémon prior to [[Generation III]].
* Rattata has gained notoriety among the fanbase due to {{tc|Youngster}} [[Joey]] on {{rt|30|Johto}}, and his phone calls claiming his Rattata to be within the top percentage of the species.
* Rattata has the lowest base {{stat|HP}} of all {{type|Normal}} Pokémon.
** {{rf|Alolan}} Rattata has the lowest base HP and {{stat|Special Attack}} of all {{type|Dark}} Pokémon.
* Alolan Rattata ties with {{p|Morpeko}} for the [[List of Pokémon by height|shortest]] Dark-type Pokémon.
* Alolan Rattata may be considered a counterpart of {{p|Yungoos}}. They can be caught at certain times of the day (Yungoos at day, Alolan Rattata at night). They also evolve into {{p|Gumshoos}} and Alolan Raticate, respectively, at level 20 at their respective times. Also, their evolved forms are the Totem Pokémon in their respective games (Gumshoos in {{pkmn|Sun and Moon|Sun}} and {{pkmn|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|Ultra Sun}}, Raticate in {{pkmn|Sun and Moon|Moon}} and {{pkmn|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|Ultra Moon}}).
* Alolan Rattata and its Evolution are the only regional forms that cannot be transferred out of {{g|HOME}} into any [[Generation VIII]] or [[Generation IX]] game.
* Together with {{p|Magikarp}}, {{p|Seedot}}, {{p|Ninjask}}, {{p|Pichu}}, and {{p|Goldeen}}, Rattata is the easiest Pokémon to catch in {{vg|Pokémon Ranger}}, with only one loop necessary.

===Origin===
Rattata appears to be based on a {{wp|rat}} or a {{wp|mouse}}. It may draw visual inspiration from hairy-tailed {{wp|Pack rat|packrats}}.

Alolan Rattata appears to be based on the {{wp|black rat}}, {{wp|brown rat}}, or {{wp|Polynesian rat}}, all of which are {{wp|invasive species}} in {{wp|Hawaii}}. Their attacks on sugar cane fields caused the locals to import the {{wp|small Indian mongoose}} into Hawaii as a form of pest control, hence the relationship between {{p|Yungoos}}/{{p|Gumshoos}} and Rattata/Raticate. Its thieving behavior and tendency to work in groups under the command of a Raticate are reminiscent of a {{wp|gangster}}. The shape of its whiskers resembles the knot of a ''hokkamuri'' — a cloth wrapped around the head and tied under the nose as a form of disguise, typically worn by thieves in Japanese media for comedic effect.

====Name origin====
Rattata may be a combination of ''rat'' and ''attack'', as indicated by its [[Pokémon Red and Green beta#Localization-specific information|pre-release name]]. It may also incorporate ''rat-a-tat'' (a tapping sound).

Koratta may be a combination of 子 ''ko'' (child) or 小 ''ko'' (small) and ''rat''.
