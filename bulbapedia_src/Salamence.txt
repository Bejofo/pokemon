'''Salamence''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ボーマンダ''' ''Bohmander'') is a dual-type {{2t|Dragon|Flying}} [[pseudo-legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation III]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Shelgon}} starting at [[level]] 50. It is the final form of {{p|Bagon}}.

Salamence can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Salamence''' using the [[Salamencite]].

The [[Paradox Pokémon]] {{p|Roaring Moon}} is said to be an ancient relative of Mega Salamence.

==Biology==
[[File:Sugimori Salamence AG.jpg|thumb|left|250px|{{aniseries|AG}} reference sheet]]
Salamence is a quadrupedal, draconic {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a long, tapering tail. It is primarily blue with a gray lower jaw and thickly scaled underside. There are red markings on its throat, the underside of its tail, and stripes on the inner surface of its legs. Additionally, there are raised red ridges above its eyes. Three flat fins protrude from either side of its head, possibly acting in the same manner that a {{wp|Canard (aeronautics)|Canard}} would on an aircraft. It has two pairs of pointed teeth, one in the upper jaw and one in the lower. Each of its short legs has three claws, capable of slicing through nearly any material. Salamence is considered an unusual Pokémon due to the circumstances of its Evolution; its fervent desire to fly triggered a cellular mutation that allowed it to suddenly grow large, red wings.

Its long-held dream fulfilled at last, Salamence constantly flies around and releases intense blasts of fire as an expression of its joy. It only stops flying when it gets exhausted and needs to sleep. If enraged, it loses all sense of self and flies into an uncontrollable rampage, destroying everything around it until it tires itself out. It lives in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Rough-terrain Pokémon|rough terrain}}, and it competes with {{p|Garchomp}} midair for food.

===Forms===
Salamence can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Salamence.

As Mega Salamence, its wings meld together into a single huge, crescent-shaped wing. Its face, neck, body, and tail are narrower, and its tail is noticeably shorter in length. The ridges above its eyes are now far less prominent, and it no longer possesses the thick, gray scaling over its lower jaw. Instead, the smooth red flesh underneath has been left exposed, increasing its streamlined appearance. The upper pair of fins resting on the sides of its head are now elongated and tapered. The lower pair has not changed much. However, the middle set now takes the form of quarter-arches, spanning towards the bridge of the nose. The remnants of its shelled underbelly have been drastically transformed into a segmented, more aerodynamic, vest-like armored frame. This frame encases its chest and shoulders with the pieces interlocking whenever Mega Salamence tucks in its front forelegs. {{p|Roaring Moon}} bears a resemblance to Mega Salamence, though the potential connection between the two is unknown.

According to ''[[XYS02|Mega Evolution Special II]]'', the hard, yet very flexible properties of its wings allow them to be used as blades in mid-air battles. The stress of Salamence's vaunted wings becoming misshapen in its Mega Evolution aggravates it to the point of rampaging. This fuels its already brutal nature and makes it likely to turn against the Trainer who raised it. Because of this, Mega Salamence is feared as "the blood-soaked crescent". Anything and anyone in Salamence's path gets sliced in two by its bladelike wings, posing no interruption to its flight.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150207095003/http://www.pokemonrubysapphire.com/en-us/pokemon/new-mega-evolutions/mega-salamence | Mega Salamence (Archived)]</ref>

===NPC appearances===
* [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Gates to Infinity]]: Salamence is a member of {{OBP|Munna|Gates to Infinity}}'s gang, working for {{OBP|Kyurem|Gates to Infinity}} to stop any humans called upon by {{OBP|Hydreigon|Gates to Infinity}} from destroying the [[Bittercold]]. He aids his companions in pursuing the player and their partner, but are outmaneuvered by Hydreigon. Salamence, along with two {{p|Chandelure}}, later attempt to stop the player and their allies from reaching the [[Glacier Palace]], but are defeated.

===Pokémon Adventures===
{{main|Zinnia's Salamence}}
When {{adv|Ruby}} was a child, he {{pkmn|battle}}d a Salamence that attacked him and {{adv|Sapphire}} while the two were playing outside. After being defeated by Ruby and having scarred his forehead with its {{m|Dragon Claw}} in the process, the Salamence went on a rampage and destroyed a lab, freeing {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (Adventures)|Rayquaza}}, which was in captivity at that time, in the process. This resulted in [[Norman]] being banned from the [[Gym Leader]] test for five years. This encounter changed both Ruby and Sapphire and their views on Pokémon, as well as themselves. In Ruby's case, he felt he was too strong, and in order to keep himself back, he focused on [[Pokémon Contest]]s. Sapphire, on the other hand, felt weak after the encounter and decided she had to become stronger, and spent much of her time in the wild honing her battle skills. It appeared in a flashback in ''[[PS252|The Beginning of the End with Kyogre & Groudon XIV]]''. In the {{MangaArc|Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire}}, where [[Zinnia]] was revealed to be its owner, it had obtained a [[Salamencite]], allowing it to [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Salamence.

In ''[[PS304|Swanky Showdown with Swalot]]'', [[Tucker]] is shown to be in possession of another Salamence, with which he defeats Sapphire. While Sapphire acknowledges the man's overwhelming skill, she also adds that such a Pokémon is a hard one to fight against with her phobic old experience many years back.

A Salamence appeared in a flashback in ''[[PS580|Flabébé Blooms]]''.

In ''[[PS600|Gorebyss Changes Color]]'', a Salamence appeared as a silhouette during {{Steven}}'s explanation about the [[Draconid people]].

[[Anabel]] owns a Salamence, which first appeared in ''[[PASM23|Battle in Vast Poni Canyon]]''.

===Pokémon Battle Frontier===
Tucker used a Salamence in a Tag Battle against {{OBP|Enta|CBF}} in ''[[CBF4|Introducing the Frontier Brains!]]''.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Salamence (TCG)}}

==In the TFG==
One Salamence figure has been released.
* {{TFG|Next Quest}}: {{TFG ID|Next Quest|Salamence|13}}

==Other appearances==
===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Salamence appears as a {{sbw|Spirit}}.

==Trivia==
* Salamence shares its {{pkmn|category}} with the {{p|Horsea}} and {{p|Dratini}} evolutionary lines, along with [[Kalos]]ian {{p|Goodra}}. They are all known as the Dragon Pokémon.
* From Generations [[Generation IV|IV]] through [[Generation VII|VII]], Salamence is unable to learn {{m|Iron Defense}} from a Move Tutor, while its pre-Evolution can.
* Salamence is the only pseudo-legendary Pokémon introduced before [[Generation IX]] who is not known to be owned by a member of the current [[World Coronation Series|Masters Eight]] in {{aniseries|JN}}.

===Origin===
Salamence seems to be based on the archetypal {{wp|European dragon}}. It may also be based on a {{wp|salamander}}, most likely the {{wp|Hida salamander}} or {{wp|Anderson's salamander}}; this is backed up by Salamence featuring three prominent finlets on either side of its head, which can be interpreted as {{wp|external gills}}. These external gills are typical for many species of amphibians. Alternatively, it might take inspiration from the {{wp|Salamanders in folklore|mythical animal of the same name}}, which is often conflated with dragons or treated as a dragon, as evidenced by its ability to learn numerous {{type|Fire}} moves by leveling up, and its [[Pokédex]] entry describing its propensity for breathing fire. 

Mega Salamence's wing and head shape resemble that of a {{wp|Fighter aircraft|fighter jet}}. Mega Salamence tucking in its front legs into the gaps on its belly, as well as its stiff yet flexible wings, may be based on {{wp|Hang gliding|hang gliding}}. Its name, "the blood-soaked crescent", could be a reference to {{wp|Lunar eclipse|blood moons}}.

====Name origin====
Salamence may be a combination of ''{{wp|Salamander (disambiguation)|salamander}}'' and ''menace'', ''vengeance'', ''vehemence'', ''violence'', or ''immense''.

Bohmander may be a combination of 暴 ''bō'' (violent) and ''salamander''.
