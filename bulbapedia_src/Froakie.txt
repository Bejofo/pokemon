'''Froakie''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ケロマツ''' ''Keromatsu'') is a {{type|Water}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation VI]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Frogadier}} starting at [[level]] 16, which evolves into {{p|Greninja}} starting at [[level]] 36.

Along with {{p|Chespin}} and {{p|Fennekin}}, Froakie is one of the three [[Kalos first partner Pokémon|first partner Pokémon of Kalos]] available at the beginning of [[Pokémon X and Y]].

Along with Chespin, Fennekin, {{p|Xerneas}}, and {{p|Yveltal}}, it was the first [[Generation VI]] Pokémon to be revealed to the public on January 8, 2013, as part of the {{DL|Nintendo Direct|Pokémon Direct}} broadcast.

==Biology==
[[File:Ash Froakie hood.png|thumb|left|250px|Froakie's bubble hood]]
Froakie is a quadrupedal, {{wp|frog}}-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. It has light-blue skin, white hands, and a dark blue stripe from the center of its oval head to its nose. It has three fingers and two toes on its hands and feet. Its eyes, which have yellow sclerae, black irises, and white pupils, protrude vertically from its head due to their size. Froakie produces a large mane of bubbles from its chest and back and has two small bubbles on its nose. 

The delicate yet flexible bubbles, called ''Frubbles'' (Japanese: '''ケロムース''' ''Keromousse''), reduce the damage Froakie takes from attacks. Despite its carefree attitude, it is vigilant of its surroundings. Froakie uses a happy-go-lucky look as an act to trick its enemies. It will suddenly drop the facade without warning and overwhelm its foes with its blinding speed. Froakie is both light and strong, making it capable of jumping incredibly high.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160224014849/http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/pokemon/starters/ Pokémon X and Y site | Starters (Archived)]</ref> Upon jumping high, it will throw springy bubbles at the heads of foes. It has been recently seen living in the [[Terarium]] of [[Blueberry Academy]].

===Evolution===
Froakie evolves into {{p|Frogadier}}, which evolves into {{p|Greninja}}.

==Trivia==
*Froakie and its [[Evolution]]s are the only Water-type first partner Pokémon evolutionary line to be in the {{egg3|Water 1}} and only the Water 1 Egg Group.
*Froakie was created by [[Yusuke Ohmura]].<ref name=TCG>Creator profile on Yusuke Ohmura in the [[Pokémon Trading Card Game Illustration Collection]], p. 183: "He has created numerous popular characters such as Piplup, Oshawott, and Froakie." ([https://twitter.com/_TropicalSplash/status/1581748599926714368 archive])</ref>
===Origin===
Froakie is based on a frog.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141007232727/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/55933/features/interview-game-freak-on-the-origins-of-pokmon-x-y/ Official Nintendo Magazine - Interview: Game Freak on the origins of Pokémon X & Y (Archived)]</ref> Its bubbling white foam is a reference to frog foam nests, created by some species such as the {{wp|Tungara frog}} and {{wp|grey foam-nest tree frog}} to protect eggs.

Froakie's foam resembles a "backpack" of sorts, and has also been used in the {{pkmn|animated series}} as a makeshift hood, which may be a reference to ''{{jwp|窃盗#概要|dorobō}}'' (burglars or thieves). In Japanese folklore and culture, ''dorobō'' use ''{{wp|furoshiki}}'' cloth bags to hold stolen goods and mask their identity, referenced in Froakie's usage of its foam. Considering its Evolutions, its characteristics, as well as its association with thievery, Froakie may also be based on a {{wp|ninja}}.

====Name origin====
Froakie may be a combination of ''frog'', ''froth'', ''croak'', and ''rookie''.

Keromatsu is a combination of ケロケロ ''kerokero'' (onomatopoeia for a frog's croaking) and 沫 ''matsu'' (bubble or foam) or 飛沫 ''himatsu'' (spray or splash).
