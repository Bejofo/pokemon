'''Lycanroc''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ルガルガン''' ''Lugarugan'') is a {{type|Rock}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation VII]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Rockruff}} starting at [[level]] 25. The [[#Form data|form]] Rockruff evolves into depends on the {{DL|Time|Time-based Evolutions|time}}, as well as its [[Ability]], which corresponds to one of Rockruff's [[Rockruff (Pokémon)#Form data|two visually indistinct forms]].
* Rockruff with the Abilities {{a|Keen Eye}}, {{a|Vital Spirit}}, or {{a|Steadfast}} evolve into:
** '''Midday Form''' Lycanroc when leveled up during the day.
** '''Midnight Form''' Lycanroc when leveled up at night.
* Rockruff with the Ability {{a|Own Tempo}} evolve into '''Dusk Form''' Lycanroc when leveled up during the evening.
(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for these details.)

==Biology==
Lycanroc is a canine {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} resembling a wolf. It has three possible forms: Midday Form, Midnight Form, and Dusk Form. The first two forms are influenced by {{p|Solgaleo}} and {{p|Lunala}} when bathed in solar or lunar energy. The third form is said to have been influenced by the setting sun of the evening. Lycanroc are used by humans as guards, to protect their fields from prey {{p|Deerling}}.
[[File:Murdock Lycanroc.png|250px|thumb|[[Murdock]]'s overweight {{TP|Murdock|Lycanroc}} ]]
;Midday Form
In its Midday Form, Lycanroc resembles a quadrupedal, light brown wolf. It has a white underbelly that extends up around its muzzle and eyes in a mask-like marking. It has pointed ears with dark brown tips and pink insides, big blue eyes, and a triangular, dark brown nose. There are four sharp fangs in its mouth: two in the upper jaw and two in the lower. Large tufts of brown fur extend from the sides of its head; three tufts on each side. A bushy, white mane covers its neck. Four dark brown rocks poke out of its mane, creating a shape similar to a stylized sun. The rocks are said to be razor-sharp. The lower portions of this form's legs are white, and each foot has three dark brown claws. It also has a long, fluffy white tail.

The Midday Form has a calm, collected, and cautious personality. In order to avoid needless fighting, the Midday Form prefers to live alone and does not form a pack with others of its kind. However, it is a fiercely loyal partner to Trainers that accept it during its unruly stage. In battle, it darts past opponents while attacking them with the rocks in its mane. These swift movements leave many foes bewildered and backed into a corner.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20190504015619/https://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/lycanroc-midday-form/ Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Midday Lycanroc (Archived)]</ref> It always aims for the foes' weak spot using its fangs. Broken fragments of its stone mane are considered good luck.

;Midnight Form
In its Midnight Form, Lycanroc instead resembles a slouched, bipedal wolf or werewolf. It has short red fur with white on its lower legs and a white streak that covers its face, underbelly, and tail. It has pointed, {{wp|Canine terminology#Ears|button ears}} with black tips, three large tufts of fur on each side of its face, a triangular black nose, and a mouth full of sharp teeth. While the sclerae, irises, and pupils of its eye are visible, they all glow a pinkish red and no distinctive colors are visible. A mane of fur covers its back and shoulders, sweeping forward over its head to form a crescent moon shape. On either side of its body, just below the shoulders, two small rocks resembling claws poke out of the mane. A single, bigger stone projects out of the front of the mane over its head. Each of this form's paws has three black claws, and it has a stubby tail covered in long fur.

In contrast to its Midday Form, Lycanroc's Midnight Form is thrilled by battling and becomes more excited the stronger its opponent. This excitement is what causes its eyes to glow.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20190504015619/https://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/lycanroc-midnight-form/ Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Midnight Lycanroc (Archived)]</ref> The Midnight Form is known to be reckless along with extremely vicious temper. Its strategy consists of closing in on its opponent and encouraging attack, then countering with a powerful blow that knocks out its opponent. The full force of its headbutts can destroy giant boulders. Trainers that can draw out its power earn its trust, but it despises those that it disagrees with or who try to force it to fight.

;Dusk Form
In its Dusk Form, Lycanroc resembles a combination of its Midday and Midnight Forms. Its body is similar to Midday Form with the same white color except with orange-gold fur. It retains the three brown claws for all four feet. The white fluffy mane resembles a sun with part of the crescent moon. It also has four rocks around its neck like a sun as well along with a single, bigger stone coming from the mane over its head. Its face resembles Midday Form Lycanroc's but is orange-gold with bright green eyes,  which can change to bright glowing red when angry or attacking.

The Dusk Form Lycanroc shares traits from the previous two forms. Its stance, calm demeanor, and loyal nature are shared with the Midday Form. However, it also shares the Midnight Form's fighting spirit, including the red, glowing eyes at the moment of attack. Dusk Form Lycanroc never barks, unlike its two other forms. Upon entering battle, Lycanroc will relentlessly drive its opponents into a corner. Due to only evolving at sunset, the Dusk Form is considered the rarest of the three forms.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170815175546/https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/secrets-of-lycanroc-dusk-form-revealed Dusk Lycanroc Revealed (Archived)]</ref> The Dusk Form of Lycanroc is rather difficult to train due to its temperamental nature. Because of this, Dusk Form Lycanroc is considered the most troublesome of its three forms.

===Form data===
{{p|Lycanroc}} has three non-interchangeable forms: Midday Form, Midnight Form, and Dusk Form. 

Internally, the games consider {{p|Rockruff}} with {{a|Own Tempo}} to be a [[Rockruff (Pokémon)#Form data|separate form]] to Rockruff with {{a|Keen Eye}}, {{a|Vital Spirit}}, or {{a|Steadfast}}, and Rockruff with Own Tempo and Dusk Form Lycanroc can {{pkmn|breeding|breed}} to produce more Rockruff with Own Tempo. After initially being {{pkmn2|event}}-exclusive, Own Tempo Rockruff and Dusk Form Lycanroc were later made accessible within normal gameplay starting in [[Generation VIII]].

Lycanroc's forms have different [[base stats]], {{Abilities}}, [[move]]s they can learn, and [[cry|cries]].

===Evolution data===
Lycanroc [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Rockruff}} starting at [[level]] 25. The [[#Form data|form]] Rockruff evolves into depends on the {{DL|Time|Time-based Evolutions|time}}, as well as its [[Ability]], which corresponds to one of Rockruff's [[Rockruff (Pokémon)#Form data|two visually indistinct forms]].

Rockruff with the Abilities {{a|Keen Eye}}, {{a|Vital Spirit}}, or {{a|Steadfast}} evolve into Midday Form Lycanroc when leveled up during the day, and Midnight Form Lycanroc when leveled up at night. In [[Generation VII]], Rockruff only evolves into Midday Form Lycanroc in {{pkmn|Sun and Moon|Pokémon Sun}} and {{pkmn|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|Ultra Sun}}, and Midnight Form Lycanroc in {{pkmn|Sun and Moon|Pokémon Moon}} and {{pkmn|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|Ultra Moon}}.

Rockruff with the Ability {{a|Own Tempo}} is a separate form that can only evolve into Dusk Form Lycanroc. It evolves into this form when leveled up during the evening: from 5:00 to 5:59 PM in in-game time in {{pkmn|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon}} (equating to 5:00 to 5:59 PM in real-time in Ultra Sun and 5:00 to 5:59 AM in real-time in Ultra Moon), from 7:00 to 7:59 PM in real-time in {{pkmn|Sword and Shield}}, and for a period lasting 3 minutes out of the 72-minute day/night cycle in {{pkmn|Scarlet and Violet}}.

{{Animedexbody|SM015|None|po={{p|Rockruff}} and {{p|Lycanroc}}|Rotom Pokédex|{{p|Rockruff}}, the Puppy Pokémon. A {{t|Rock}} type. Rockruff have lived with humans since ancient times. They train themselves by running around. Rockruff evolves into Lycanroc, which has two different forms based on when it evolves. It evolves into Midday Form Lycanroc during the day and Midnight Form Lycanroc during the night. Furthermore, when it gets close to evolving, Rockruff's temperament becomes more aggressive, and it tends to act more independent. It's common for it to disappear and then return after it has evolved.}}

==In the TCG==
{{main|Lycanroc (TCG)}}
==Trivia==
* The [[QR Code]] displayed in the [[Pokédex]] entry for Dusk Form Lycanroc is actually that of Midday Form Lycanroc.
* Lycanroc and {{p|Mr. Mime}} are the only two Pokémon known to have six possible {{Abilities}} between their forms, the most of any Pokémon.
* In [[Generation IX]], prior to the Version 2.0.1 update of {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, Dusk Form Lycanroc was unable to learn {{m|Mud-Slap}} and {{m|Body Slam}} via [[TM]], while its pre-Evolution could.

===Origin===
Overall, Lycanroc shares traits with the extinct {{wp|Japanese wolf|Japanese}} and {{wp|Hokkaido wolf|Hokkaido wolves}} in particular. Its {{t|Rock}} typing seems to be a reference to the link between {{wp|Wolf|wolves}} (also called as 山犬 ''yamainu'', lit. mountain dog) and mountains in Japan.

Lycanroc's Midday and Dusk Forms appear to be based on a wolf, while its Midnight Form appears to be based on a {{wp|werewolf}}. The duality between Midday and Midnight Forms may be a reference to the {{wp|okuri-inu}}, a mountain wolf creature that could take either a protective approach, similar to Midday Form's behavior; or an aggressive one much like Midnight Form's.

The coloration of Dusk Form Lycanroc appears to be based on sunrises and sunsets. Its orange fur resembles the sky during these times, and its green eyes are possibly inspired by the rare optical phenomenon known as the {{wp|green flash}}, a brief flash of green light that can sometimes be seen above the sun. This is supported by Dusk Form Lycanroc's [[Methods of Evolution|method of Evolution]], and Ash's {{AP|Lycanroc}} evolving during a sunset in which a green flash is visible in {{aniseries|SM}}.

====Name origin====
Lycanroc may be a combination of ''{{wp|werewolf|lycanthrope}}'' and ''rock''.

Lugarugan may be a combination of ''{{wp|rougarou}}'', ''loup-garou'' (French for ''werewolf''), ガルル ''garuru'' (a dog's growling), and 岩 ''gan'' (rock).
