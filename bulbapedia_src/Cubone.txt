'''Cubone''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''カラカラ''' ''Karakara'') is a {{type|Ground}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s into {{p|Marowak}} starting at [[level]] 28.

In [[Alola]], Cubone evolves into {{rf|Alolan}} {{p|Marowak}} when leveled up at [[Time-based Evolution|night]] starting at level 28.

==Biology==
Cubone is a small, bipedal, {{wp|dinosaur}}-like {{wp|reptile|reptilian}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a light brown hide that covers most of its body, except for its cream-colored belly. Two small claws, one on each hand, serve as its thumbs, and one large nail on each foot make up its toes. It has two small spikes on its back and a short tail. On its head, Cubone wears the skull of its dead mother as a helmet. Because of this, much of its actual face has never been seen, except for its triangular, black (sometimes green or blue) eyes and a small area surrounding them, and in its [[Bandai Namco]] card a bit of its mouth, where it has a pair of a few sharp teeth and a long pink tongue. The skull has two rounded horns on the top of its head and a tooth-like point on the lower sides. Under the skull, Cubone has a brown snout. This small Pokémon survives only through the immense skill it possesses in wielding the bone it carries as a weapon.

It is called the {{pkmn|category|Lonely Pokémon}} because of its tendency to keep to itself and avoid social situations, due to the trauma caused by the death of its {{p|Marowak}} mother. Cubone will often weep at night in mourning of its mother. When Cubone cries, the skull that it wears on its head vibrates and emits "a plaintive and mournful sound." On the night of a full moon, the cries are said to be especially terrible. Cubone seems to recognize a likeness of its mother in the full moon, and so it howls with a particular sadness. Its cries attract {{p|Mandibuzz}}, its natural predator, who uses this Pokémon's bones to decorate itself and its nest. It is said a Cubone will evolve into a {{p|Marowak}} once it comes to terms with the pain of its mother's death. As mentioned in {{g|Sleep}}, Cubone is known to cry while sleeping.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref> It is theorized that Cubone's dreams are about its deceased mother. The dreams Cubone have make it cry, but crying makes it stronger. Cubone lives in rocky areas, usually on {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Mountain Pokémon|mountains}} or in caves. It also once inhabited the Pokémon Tower in [[Lavender Town]] where deceased Pokémon were buried and mourned. One such Cubone's mother is shown as a ghost there.

Cubone and its evolved form, {{p|Marowak}}, are the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the moves {{m|Bone Club}} and {{m|Bonemerang}}. Cubone and Marowak are also the only known Pokémon capable of using the [[Thick Club]] item. In Generations {{gen|II}} and {{gen|III}}, {{m|Bone Rush}} was another one of their signature moves.

===Evolution===
Cubone evolves into {{p|Marowak}}.

In [[Alola]], it evolves into {{rf|Alolan}} Marowak.

===NPC appearances===
* [[Pokémon Red and Blue Versions|Pokémon Red, Blue]], {{v2|Yellow}}, [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Versions|FireRed, and LeafGreen]]: An orphaned Cubone appears in the care of [[Mr. Fuji]]. It lost its mother, a {{OBP|Marowak|ghost}}, while she was defending her charge from [[Team Rocket]].
* [[Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!]]: The same orphaned Cubone plays an expanded role in Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, where it is kidnapped by [[Archer]] after wandering from [[Lavender Town]]. After being rescued by the {{player}} from [[Team Rocket Hideout]], it returns to [[Pokémon Tower]], where it helps the player and {{ga|Trace}} calm his mother's spirit. Trace later adopts Cubone into his [[party]], motivating himself to become stronger to stop Team Rocket and avenge Marowak. Cubone later [[Evolution|evolves]] under Trace's ownership.

==Trivia==
<!--DO NOT PUT FAN THEORIES HERE.-->
[[File:Bandai Cubone card.jpg|thumb|200px|Cubone's face partially revealed]]
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Cubone was originally known as "Orphon", a corruption of the word "orphan", based on its abandonment at birth.
* Cubone is [[Midori Harada]]'s favorite {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}.
* Cubone is one of the Pokémon that appears in the [[Pokémon 151]] clothing line.
* Cubone is the only Pokémon that can [[Evolution|evolve]] into a dual-[[type]] Pokémon that doesn't share any types with its Evolution.
* A [[Bandai Pokémon Carddass Cards|Japanese trading card]], which features Cubone using the move {{m|Growl}}, partially reveals Cubone's face.
* While {{rf|Alolan}} Marowak shares the {{a|Rock Head}} [[Ability]] with Cubone, Cubone is unable to retain this Ability after evolving in the [[Alola]] [[region]]. This is because Cubone's Rock Head is its first Ability, while Alolan Marowak's Rock Head is its Hidden Ability. It shares this trait with {{p|Tyrogue}} and {{p|Hitmontop}}'s Ability {{a|Steadfast}}.
* In the [[PO02|second episode]] of [[Pokémon Origins]], a mother Marowak is shown protecting her child Cubone from [[Team Rocket]]. Even though the Marowak is alive, the Cubone is still wearing a skull.
* Despite the Pokédex saying that Cubone wears the skull of its dead mother, Cubone are born wearing the skull when hatched from [[Pokémon Egg|Eggs]].
* In ''[[The Official Pokémon Handbook|The Official Pokémon Handbook: Deluxe Edition]]'', there is no mention of Cubone wearing the skull of its mother. Instead, this is said in Cubone's Pokédex entry from this book: ''"Cubone uses the bones of ancient Pokémon to make armor and crude weapons."''

===Origin===
Cubone was created out of the thought of how sad it would be for a Pokémon to die.<ref>Satoshi Tajiri: "There's also Cubone, who was born from the thought of how sad it would be for a Pokémon to die. The bone Cubone holds is actually the bone of its dead mother. Cubone treasures it." [http://lavacutcontent.com/satoshi-tajiri-1997-interview/ Translation: Satoshi Tajiri Cuts Loose (1997 Interview)]</ref> In its design, it is reptilian in nature and seems to be loosely based on bipedal {{wp|dinosaur}}s. It also could be based on primitive cultures that wore bones for decoration and used them for weapons. The use of its bone {{m|Bonemerang|as a boomerang and as a weapon at the same time}} seems to be a reference to the {{wp|boomerang}}'s original use for hunting in {{wp|Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian}} cultures.

====Name origin====
Cubone is a combination of ''cub'' and ''bone''.<ref name=MonsterKids>Dockery, Daniel (October 4, 2022). ''[[Monster Kids: How Pokémon Taught a Generation to Catch Them All]]''. Running Press. p. 33. ISBN 978-0762479504.</ref>

Karakara may be derived from カラカラ ''karakara'' (onomatopoeia for light clattering), contrasting with the ガラガラ ''garagara'' (onomatopoeia for heavy clattering) in {{p|Marowak}}'s Japanese name.
