'''Dodrio''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ドードリオ''' ''Dodorio'') is a dual-type {{2t|Normal|Flying}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Doduo}} starting at [[level]] 31.

==Biology==
Dodrio is a large, wingless, three-headed [[wp:Bird|avian]] {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. Each head has a long, sharp beak and a black V-shaped, feather crest. It has bristly brown feathers covering its head and upper body, while its lower half has a smooth layer of black feathers. Its tail consists of three pale red feathers with lighter tips. Its wingless body rests on two long and slender, but powerful legs with feet that have three clawed toes in front and one in back. A male has black necks, whereas a female has brown necks; both genders have brown legs.

Each head has its own working brain and distinct personality. Each head represents and expresses either sorrow, anger, or joy. Despite being separate, it has the innate ability to use all three of its brains to collect data, formulate, and then execute complex plans and strategies. However, on occasion, it may overthink, which causes it to become immobilized and unable to carry out any action whatsoever. Being separate individuals on the same body, the three heads will continue to bicker until they, or at least one of them, gets to eat. This satisfies the other two heads, quelling them and temporarily ending their infighting. The strongest of Dodrio's heads and the thickest neck will become the leader and gain primary control of the body. Another form of adaptation that it has acquired is the ability to have at least one head alert at all times. Extreme caution is advised when all three heads are facing separate directions. It is in this state that it is the most dangerous and going near it may result in a severe pecking.

Along with its three heads, it has three sets of hearts and lungs as well. This allows it to efficiently oxygenate and pump blood throughout its body, thus giving it increased endurance to run vast distances without rest. It is especially prone to race vigorously across {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|grassy plains}}, even in arid seasons with little rainfall. As a result, despite being slower than {{p|Doduo}}, Dodrio can keep running for an even longer time. As mentioned in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Dodrio is known to usually sleep standing up.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref> Each of the three heads taking turns sleeping while one head stays awake. However, should Dodrio become very tired, even the head that remains awake may start to doze off.

===Evolution===
Dodrio evolves from {{p|Doduo}}.

==Trivia==
[[File:Dodrio Fly Stad.png|thumb|250px|Dodrio flying in [[Pokémon Stadium]]]]
* While one of its heads is saying something in [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team|Pokémon Mystery Dungeon]], the others say ''me too'' or ''mine too'', but its pre-evolved form's other head will not.
* Dodrio is the only Pokémon whose National Pokédex number is the whole number portion of its weight in kilograms.
* According to its Pokédex entries, {{p|Doduo}} can run at 60&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h), while Dodrio can only run at nearly 40&nbsp;mph (60&nbsp;km/h). However, Dodrio's base {{stat|Speed}} stat is higher.
* Dodrio is featured in the [[Generation III]] wireless mini-game, [[Dodrio Berry Picking]], where it is required that players own a Dodrio to be able to play.
* Before [[Generation IV]], the necks of normal Dodrio were beige (which became the female neck color), while its {{p|Doduo|pre-Evolution's}} necks were black (which became the male neck color).
* Dodrio and Doduo are the only {{type|Flying}} {{DL|List of Pokémon by shape|Pokémon consisting of a head and legs}}.

===Origin===
Despite its name, Dodrio seems like it has more in common with {{wp|ostrich}}es than {{wp|dodo}}s. It also seems to show some similarities to the {{wp|moa}}, an extinct flightless bird; and the {{wp|emu}}, another flightless bird. It also resembles the {{wp|kiwi (bird)|kiwi}} in some ways as well. Its crests also indicate it was based on {{wp|cassowary|cassowaries}}. The triple head might be a biological mutation. It may also draw inspiration from the {{wp|Asura (Buddhism)|Buddhist asuras}}, three-headed demigods whose faces are sometimes said to each embody one of three emotions: joy, anger, and sorrow. This connection was alluded to in its [[Pokédex entry]] in the ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' episode ''[[EP033|The Flame Pokémon-athon!]]'' and in its entry in {{g|Stadium}}.

====Name origin====
Dodrio may be a combination of ''{{wp|dodo}}'' (an extinct, flightless bird) and ''trio'' (group of three).

Dodorio may be a combination of ドードー ''dodo'', 鳥 ''tori'' (bird), and トリオ ''trio''.
