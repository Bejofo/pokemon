'''Muk''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ベトベトン''' ''Betbeton'') is a {{type|Poison}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s from {{p|Grimer}} starting at [[level]] 38.

In [[Alola]], Muk has a dual-type {{2t|Poison|Dark}} [[regional form]]. It evolves from Alolan Grimer starting at level 38. These Muk can also be found in [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]].

==Biology==
Muk is a large, sticky, amorphous {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} made of living purple sludge. It has two small eyes with beady black pupils. It also has an enormous mouth with a gray tongue and strands of ooze connecting its top and bottom jaws. While it has no visible legs, it does have two arms with three fingers on each hand. However, it typically keeps one hand tucked in while it extends the other hand.

Muk is a living biohazard, leaking toxins that instantly kill all plant life it touches. Even it being in close proximity to plants will cause them to wilt and die. Extreme caution is advised in avoiding any contact with this Pokémon, as an accidental brush-up can lead to severe sickness. The effects of this Pokémon can leave the landscape barren for three years. It will readily consume nearly any waste or refuse generated by people and Pokémon alike. Muk's body produces a powerful odor that can cause fainting. However, despite the risk Muk's stench contains, some fans of Muk believe its stench is a good thing.

Muk can be found in heavily polluted bodies of water, {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Urban Pokémon|factories and cities}}, where groups can gather to consume trash that people throw away into the streets. However, Muk's population has declined due to recent environmental improvements and extermination efforts. This has led some to believe that it will go extinct at some point; sludge ponds are being built to prevent its extinction.

Prior to [[Generation IV]], Muk and its pre-evolved form, Grimer, were the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that could have {{a|Stench}} as an [[Ability]].

===Forms===
Muk has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Alolan}} Muk.

{{rf|Alolan}} Muk has a more vibrant coloration, consisting of green, pink, and yellow stripes with thin blue bands in between. The green, yellow, and pink stripes are capable of shifting downwards while the blue stays in place. It has various white, crystallized poison shards protruding from parts of its body, especially from its mouth and fingers, giving the impression of claws and fangs. It has blue eyes with a black space behind them and a bright blue tongue. Its vivid coloration is a result of the garbage it eats, which causes chemical changes in its body. Its body contains over a hundred different kinds of poisons. Chemical reactions of different poisons occurring within its body is the source of Alolan Muk's vitality.

Alolan Muk is unexpectedly quiet and friendly. However, if it is not fed trash for a while, its hunger will compel it to destroy its Trainer's furnishings for food. It is thought that it cannot maintain its energy without a constant source of toxins, which causes its voracious appetite. The crystals covering its body have a tendency to break off, which makes it extremely difficult to deal with due to the concentrated toxins contained within them. Unlike Kantonian Muk, Alolan Muk does not produce a foul stench due to its toxins being contained within its body.<ref>[http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-ca/pokemon/alolan-muk/ Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Alolan Muk]</ref> Alolan Muk preys on {{p|Trubbish}} and {{p|Garbodor}}. They can also be found in the [[Coastal Biome]] of [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]], where Alola's island life is simulated.

Alolan Muk and its pre-evolved form, Alolan {{p|Grimer}}, are the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Power of Alchemy}} as an [[Ability]].

===Evolution===
Muk evolves from {{p|Grimer}}.

{{rf|Alolan}} Muk evolves from Alolan Grimer.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Muk (TCG)}}

==Trivia==
* Muk shares similar traits to {{p|Weezing}} and {{p|Garbodor}}. All three {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} are pure {{type|Poison}} Pokémon with a single pre-[[Evolution|evolved]] form, roughly the same base stat totals and Evolution levels, and appear to be based on a different kind of pollution, Muk being water pollution.
* Alolan Muk and its Alolan pre-evolved form were designed by [[Hitoshi Ariga]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/ariga_megamix/status/804500572967555072 Tweet by ありがひとし/ArigaHitoshi (@ariga_megamix).] Posted on December 2, 2016.</ref>
* Muk is tied with {{p|Mew}} for the shortest English name of all Pokémon.

===Origin===
Muk appears to be a pile of living {{wp|sludge}}. It may also be based on the imagined fear that heavy pollution, caused by the leakage and/or improper disposal of toxic/radioactive waste, may result in the creation of new and undesirable life. It may also be based on ''Dorotabō'', a one-eyed, three-fingered ''{{wp|yōkai}}'' that rises from the mud of neglected, overgrown rice fields.

Alolan Muk may be based on an {{wp|oil slick}}, particularly the rainbow colors that are produced when a thin layer of oil floats on top of water; this is due to a phenomenon called {{wp|thin-film interference}}. In the real world, oil spills are a major threat to ecosystems in the world's oceans and particularly in Hawaii, which Alola is based on.

====Name origin====
Muk is a corruption of ''muck'' (generally something filthy).

Betbeton may be derived from べとべと ''betobeto'' (sticky) and ''ton''.
