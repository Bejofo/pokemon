'''Scyther''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ストライク''' ''Strike'') is a dual-type {{2t|Bug|Flying}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Scizor}} when [[Trade Evolution|traded]] while holding a [[Metal Coat]] or {{p|Kleavor}} when exposed to a [[Black Augurite]].

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for more details.)

==Biology==
Scyther is a bipedal, {{wp|insect|insectoid}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. Its body is primarily green and has a thin, cream-colored section between its head, thorax, and abdomen. Female Scyther have larger abdomens than male Scyther. Its reptilian head has two narrow, triangular eyes and three blunt horns extending from its forehead. Its arms end in large, white scythes, which it uses for both hunting and fighting. Two pairs of cream-colored wings extend from its back. While these wings do allow Scyther to fly, it rarely does so. Scyther's thighs have large, upward-pointing spikes. Its feet are tall, rounded, and conical, almost extending to its thighs; each foot ends in three small, white claws on its front side.

Scyther is an adept hunter that tears at its prey with its scythes. Thanks to its green coloration, it can camouflage itself well in the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|grasslands}} and forests where it lives. Humans rarely encounter wild Scyther in these areas, however. Said to be like a ninja, Scyther can move so quickly that it cannot be followed, increasing the effectiveness of its scythes. It maintains the sharpness of its blades through battle as well as by cutting through hard objects, such as trees; it can cut down a massive tree with just a single slice, although it cannot penetrate {{p|Tarountula}}'s elastic threads. The ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' episode ''[[EP097|Tracey Gets Bugged]]'' showed that wild Scyther form swarms with a single leader chosen through combat. When a challenger successfully defeats a current leader and replaces it, the defeated leader is exiled from the swarm. In ''[[EP042|Showdown at Dark City]]'', it was shown that Scyther becomes aggressive when faced with the color red.

===Evolution===
Scyther evolves into {{p|Scizor}}.

In [[Hisui]], it evolves into {{p|Kleavor}}.

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
* {{g|Snap}}: A Scyther appears at two points on the Beach level. At the first point, the use of a Pester Ball will chase it out. (This also triggers a special Multiple Pikachu Photo opportunity.) The second point is close to the end of the Beach level.
* {{g|Stadium 2}}: Scyther stars in a mini-game alongside {{p|Pinsir}} called "Clear Cut Challenge." Each player chops a falling log for each round of the game. The score for each player is determined by how close the player is to the white line on the log. Cutting anywhere above the log will cause the player to lose points.
* {{vg|Pokémon Ranger}}: [[Go-Rock Quads|Garret]] uses two Scyther to back up his {{p|Scizor}}.
* {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}}: Scyther is one of the members of Team Razor Wind. The same Scyther returns at Super Mystery Dungeon.

===Evolution data===
Scyther [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Scizor}} when [[Trade Evolution|traded]] while holding a [[Metal Coat]]. Scyther cannot evolve into Scizor in {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}} before the player obtains the [[National Pokédex]], as its Evolution will be interrupted. Scyther also cannot evolve into Scizor in {{LGPE}}, as Scizor is not present in those games. In {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, Scyther evolves into Scizor when exposed to a Metal Coat.

In [[Hisui]], Scyther evolves into {{p|Kleavor}} when exposed to a [[Black Augurite]].

* {{TFG|Next Quest}}: {{TFG ID|Next Quest|Scyther|20}}

==Trivia==
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Scyther's prototype name was "Stryke". This is a corruption of the word "strike", which is also its romanized Japanese name.
* Despite having different base stats, Scyther and its [[Evolution|evolved]] forms all have a base stat total of 500. This makes Scyther the only pre-evolved Pokémon to have the same base stat total as its evolved forms.
* Scyther can be seen as a parallel to {{p|Pinsir}}. Both of them are {{type|Bug}} {{cat|Generation I Pokémon}}, with base stat totals of 500 and originally no evolutionary line. Scyther is exclusive to [[Pokémon Red and Blue Versions|Pokémon Red]], [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Versions|FireRed]], [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl Versions|Diamond]], and [[Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|Let's Go, Pikachu!]], while Pinsir is exclusive to [[Pokémon Red and Blue Versions|Pokémon Blue]], [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Versions|LeafGreen]], [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl Versions|Pearl]], and [[Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!|Let's Go, Eevee!]].
* In {{game|Platinum}}, {{2v2|HeartGold|SoulSilver}}, Scyther can learn {{m|Vacuum Wave}} by leveling up, but not via [[Move Tutor]].
* Scyther is the only Pokémon with a [[List of Pokémon with branched Evolutions|branched Evolution]] to have had both of its Evolutions introduced after its debut.
* Scyther's Evolution into {{p|Kleavor}}, as well as {{p|Ursaring}} and {{p|Stantler}}'s Evolutions, are all programmed into [[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet]], with the Pokémon being affected by [[Eviolite]]. However, it is impossible to trigger them in-game as they are assigned to a placeholder [[methods of Evolution|Evolution method]] with no code that can trigger it.
** Despite this, wild Kleavor can still be found in the [[Canyon Biome]] in [[The Indigo Disk]].

===Origin===
As indicated by its category, Scyther seems to be based on a {{wp|mantis}} — most closely resembling the {{wp|European mantis}} and the {{wp|Chinese mantis}} — with arms shaped like {{wp|scythe}}s. It also possesses some {{wp|reptile|reptilian}} characteristics (e.g. head, teeth, claws, bipedal stance) that give it similarities to {{wp|Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurid}} dinosaurs, as well as to {{wp|Therizinosauridae|therizinosaurids}} (scythe lizards) due to the shape of its arms. As indicated in its Pokédex entries, it may also be based on a ninja. There are similarities to the {{wp|Kamikiri (haircutting)|kamikiri}}, a haircutting yokai with sharp claws and teeth that may look like an insect.

====Name origin====
Scyther may be a combination of ''scythe'' and the suffix ''-er'' (something that does an action).

Strike is literally ''strike''.
