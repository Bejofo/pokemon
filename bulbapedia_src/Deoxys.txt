'''Deoxys''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''デオキシス''' ''Deoxys'') is a {{type|Psychic}} [[Mythical Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation III]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Deoxys has four [[#Form data|forms]]: '''Normal Forme''', '''Attack Forme''', '''Defense Forme''', and '''Speed Forme'''. It can change between its forms by interacting with certain [[meteorite]]s.

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Form data|Game data&rarr;Form data]] for these details.)

It is associated with {{p|Rayquaza}}.

==Biology==
[[File:386Deoxys AG anime.png|thumb|200px|left|Deoxys forming [[human]]-like hands]]
Deoxys is an alien-like, bipedal {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that has four forms, each focused on a different stat. The main components that are constant for all four forms are dominantly a red color, a light blue face, and three light blue dots on its back arranged in a triangle. There is a purple stripe running down the center of its face and a purple, crystalline organ in its chest. Its white, circular eyes are set inside rectangular, black eye sockets.

Deoxys was formed by the mutation of a virus from space. The Pokémon is highly intelligent; its brain appears to be the crystal in its chest. This organ is capable of firing laser beams. It was also shown the ability to morph its tentacles into [[human]]-like hands. While inactive, it can also take the form of a triangular, stone tablet. As shown in ''[[M07|Destiny Deoxys]]'', it is able to regenerate any part of its body that it may have lost during a battle. It has also demonstrated the ability to create an aurora without changing its form. These auroras can have different electromagnetic wavelengths and are used to communicate with other Deoxys. It is also shown that the various electromagnetic waves given off by people, Pokémon, and all electronics can obscure its vision if there is enough interference with its communication. Deoxys can use powerful telekinesis in combat, and its different forms grant it further abilities and techniques to use in battle.
[[File:Deoxys purple crystal Recover.png|thumb|250px|right|Deoxys {{m|Recover|regenerating}} itself]]
In ''Destiny Deoxys'' and [[Pokémon Adventures]], Deoxys has been observed to create clones of itself. These clones have lifeless eyes and duller color, lack of the trademark crystal on the chest, and seem to be unable to change from the Normal Forme. Furthermore, they seem unable to morph their tentacles into hands. When these clones are defeated, they dissolve into dust-like particles. Deoxys is bitter enemies with {{p|Rayquaza}}, with the two often clashing with each other, as depicted in several media.

Deoxys is an [[extraterrestrial Pokémon]] that was coming towards the [[Pokémon world|planet]] inside the [[Grand Meteor Delta]] during the [[Delta Episode]]. The meteor was ultimately destroyed, and Deoxys is defeated or caught by the {{Player}} and {{pkmn2|Mega}} Rayquaza.

Deoxys is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Psycho Boost}} by leveling up.

===Forms===
[[File:Deoxys core Birth Island Movement ORAS.png|thumb|left|<!--APNG, do not set a thumbnail size-->Deoxys floating in space in the form of a triangular, stone tablet]]
Deoxys has four forms: Normal Forme, Attack Forme, Defense Forme, and Speed Forme.

;Normal Forme
In its Normal Forme, Deoxys has tapering legs with a segmented, vertical, blue stripe on the upper portion. The abdomen is black with vertical lines, while the majority of its skin is reddish-orange. The arms are capable of taking different forms, usually a pair of tentacles coiled in a double helix. One tentacle is the primary skin color, while the other is light blue. Alternately, it can form more humanoid arms with a red top and blue underside and a five-fingered hand. This Forme has a blunt protrusion with a single blue stripe on either side of its head and stubby tail. It is the most balanced form.

;Attack Forme
While in its Attack Forme, Deoxys's legs remain tapered. However, its blue stripes are no longer segmented and run the entire length of the leg and there is now a large spike on the knee. Two pairs of whip-like tentacles with pointed tips, one reddish-orange and one blue, replace its previous coiled, blunted tentacles. The protrusions on its head are now triangular with an additional one extending from the top of its head. Most of its reddish-orange skin has receded, revealing a striated, black chest and abdomen. Finally, its tail is now longer and more pointed. It is the most offensively powerful form and is said to possess an aggressive disposition.

;Defense Forme
Deoxys's Defense Forme has bulky, wide legs that are somewhat flat at the end with a bluish-green spot on each knee. It retains its two pairs of red and blue tentacles, but they are now flat and broad. The head has fused with its body and all protrusions are gone, causing it to resemble a helmet. The reddish-orange skin now covers the entire body, so none of its inner black portions are visible. There is now a single blue stripe on each shoulder, and its tail has disappeared. It is the most defensively capable form.

;Speed Forme
The Speed Forme of this Pokémon has a sleek black body with thin striation. The reddish-orange skin now covers only its head, hip joints, and the area around its crystal. There is now only one tentacle on each side of its body, one red and one blue. The protrusions on its head now point upward and the back of its head now forms a long spike. There is a long, thick blue stripe running down the center of this longer protrusion. More blue stripes appear on either hip joint and on its legs. It possesses the greatest agility out of the four forms.

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
*{{g|Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team}}: Deoxys first appears after the completion of the main story, where {{OBP|Xatu|Red and Blue Rescue Team}} and {{p|Blastoise}} mention a new [[Meteor Cave|cave]] formed by the meteorite shards destroyed by {{p|Rayquaza}}. Upon reaching the final floor of the dungeon, an amnesiac Deoxys will fight the player, asking for the answers of the cave's origins.
*{{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}}: Deoxys first appears while traveling space when it is nearly hit by a fleeing Mega Rayquaza, and it's surprised that even the fellow legendary Pokémon would be frightened as such. Like the other legendaries, he learns of [[Dark Matter]]'s intention to eliminate all life by sending the [[Tree of Life]] into the sun. Deoxys and Mega Rayquaza later oppose the Tree of Life's ascent from space, but when Dark Matter regenerates itself, it lets out a massive shockwave that turns all the legendary Pokémon into stone, including Deoxys and Mega Rayquaza. After Dark Matter is defeated and the petrified Pokémon are restored, Deoxys will take its residence at [[Meteorite Crater]].
{{spoilers}}
*[[Detective Pikachu Returns]]: Deoxys plays a notable role during the climax of the game, where it's revealed that the famous jewel known as the [[Aurora Drop]] is actually the crystal core of a Deoxys. Scientist [[Charles Merloch]] restores Deoxys's body and fuses his mind with it, becoming one with Deoxys. He fights {{OBP|Mewtwo|Detective Pikachu}}, until {{OBP|Detective Pikachu|character}} undoes the fusion, reducing Deoxys to nothing but a crystal core once more and returning Merloch's mind to his body.

===Form data===
Deoxys has four different forms which it can switch between. It was the first Pokémon whose [[base stats]] and [[move]]s it could learn differed depending on its form.

In [[Generation III]], Deoxys's forms are game-specific, such that it will always be in one particular form while in the player's possession (although it will always be in Normal Forme in the {{pkmn2|wild}}). Its form can only be changed by [[Trade|trading]] it to a different game. In {{game|Ruby and Sapphire|s}}, {{g|Colosseum}}, and {{g|XD: Gale of Darkness}}, it will be in its Normal Forme. In {{game3|FireRed and LeafGreen|Pokémon FireRed|s}}, it will be in its Attack Forme. In {{game3|FireRed and LeafGreen|Pokémon LeafGreen|s}}, it will be in its Defense Forme. In {{game|Emerald}}, it will be in its Speed Forme.

From [[Generation IV]] to [[Generation VIII]], the player can change its form by interacting with certain meteorites while it is in the [[party]]: in {{game|Diamond and Pearl|s|Pokémon Diamond, Pearl}}, {{v2|Platinum}}, {{pkmn|Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl|Brilliant Diamond, and Shining Pearl}}, using meteorites outside in [[Veilstone City]]; in {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}}, using meteorites outside on {{rt|3|Kanto}}; in {{game4|BWB2W2}}, using the meteorite in {{DL|Nacrene City|Nacrene Museum}} in [[Nacrene City]]; in {{g|X and Y}}, using meteorites in the {{DL|Ambrette Town|Fossil Lab}} in [[Ambrette Town]]; in {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, using the meteorite in [[Professor Cozmo]]'s house in [[Fallarbor Town]]; and in {{game4|SMUSUM}}, using the meteorite next to [[Sophocles]] in [[Hokulani Observatory]] on [[Mount Hokulani]].

In {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, the player can win a [[Meteorite]] from an auction at the [[Porto Marinada Market]] if they own a Deoxys. When used, the Meteorite will cycle Deoxys to its next form in the order of Normal Forme, Attack Forme, Defense Forme, Speed Forme.

When recruited in {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team}}, [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness|Explorers of Time, Darkness]] and [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky|Sky]], Deoxys will be in its Normal Forme when playing in the overworld; however, when exploring a dungeon, Deoxys's Forme will be randomly selected each time the player progresses to a new floor. In {{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}}, it will cycle through Formes after being used in a dungeon, and in {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX}}, its Forme can be selected upon being added as a team member.

{{Evobox/Formes
|sprite1=0386Deoxys
|name1=Deoxys
|type1-1=Psychic

|sprite2=0386Deoxys-Attack
|forme2=Attack Forme
|sprite3=0386Deoxys-Defense
|forme3=Defense Forme
|sprite4=0386Deoxys-Speed
|forme4=Speed Forme}}

Deoxys's Normal Forme is the default form it takes. In this form, it has very high {{stat|Attack}}, {{stat|Special Attack}}, and {{stat|Speed}}, but low {{stat|Defense}} and {{stat|Special Defense}}, alongside a low {{stat|HP}} stat (which remains the same in all of its forms).

Deoxys's Attack Forme has even higher Attack and Special Attack than its other forms and learns more offensive moves. Its Defense and Special Defense are abysmal, much lower than those of its Normal Forme. Its Speed remains the same as in its Normal Forme.

Deoxys's Defense Forme has much higher Defense and Special Defense than its other forms and learns more defensive moves. Its Attack, Special Attack, and Speed are much lower than those of its Normal Forme.

Deoxys's Speed Forme has much higher Speed than its other forms (having the second highest Speed of all Pokémon) and learns many moves with increased [[priority]]. Additionally, its Defense and Special Defense are higher than in its Normal Forme, though its Attack and Special Attack are lower than in its Normal Forme.

In the Mystery Dungeon games, the drastic shift in Deoxys's stat distribution between forms is instead represented by passive [[stat stage]] modifications. In the Rescue Team and Explorers games, Deoxys gains +2 stages to each of its Attack stats in Attack Forme, but -2 to each of its Defense stats, while Defense Forme inverts these. Its Speed Forme reduces all of its stats, but increases [[Movement Speed]]. In later games, its Defense Forme instead has a [[Stat (Mystery Dungeon)#Speed|Speed]] penalty, and its Speed Forme instead gains Speed and only suffers an offensive penalty.

==In animation==
[[File:Deoxys Normal Forme anime.png|thumb|250px|Normal Forme Deoxys in {{aniseries|PTS}}]]
===Main series===
====Major appearances====
=====[[Deoxys (M07)]]=====
Deoxys debuted in ''[[M07|Destiny Deoxys]]''. Two fell to the {{pkmn|world}} in a meteorite; one had a green crystalline organ, and the other had the standard purple one. When the Deoxys with the green crystal (which spent most of its time as a crystal in the {{pkmn|movie}}) was taken to [[LaRousse City]], the purple crystal Deoxys followed behind and began to search for it. As {{game|Emerald}} had not been released when the movie was produced, only its {{stat|Defense}}, Normal, and {{stat|Attack}} Formes appeared.

=====[[Deoxys (anime)]]=====
A Deoxys appeared in ''[[AG171|Pokémon Ranger - Deoxys' Crisis! (Part 1)]]'', where its {{stat|Speed}} Forme made its debut. The DNA Pokémon played a major role in this episode and [[AG172|the follow-up episode]].

=====Other=====
In ''[[DP112|Cheers on Castaways Isle!]]'', a Deoxys was seen in all of its Formes. It crash-landed as a meteor on a deserted island in the middle of [[Diablo's Ocean]], shattering upon impact and leaving only its crystal. As a result, the local {{type|Water}} Pokémon worked together to gather meteor fragments to help restore it. This eventually worked after receiving help from {{AP|Pikachu}} and {{TP|Dawn|Piplup}}.

In [[PK21]], a Deoxys saved Pikachu, Piplup, and a {{pkmn2|wild}} {{p|Skitty}} when they all fell from a stone staircase.

In ''[[SM124|Living on the Cutting Edge!]]'', a Deoxys was battling {{p|Rayquaza}} in outer space. The battle accidentally caused one of the meteors to head towards [[Alola]], though it was ultimately cut up by a {{DL|Ultra Beasts (anime)|Kartana}}, saving the [[region]] from harm. In the episode, Deoxys appeared in its Normal and Defense Formes.

====Minor appearances====
In the opening sequence of ''[[M10|The Rise of Darkrai]]'', two Deoxys were soaring across the sky in their Normal Formes.

A Deoxys appeared in the opening sequence of ''[[M13|Zoroark: Master of Illusions]]''.

===Pokémon Adventures===
{{spoilers}}
{{main|Deoxys (Adventures)}}
Two Deoxys play major roles in the events of the {{MangaArc|FireRed & LeafGreen}}, referred to as "Organism No. 1" and "Organism No. 2". Organism No. 1 first appeared in ''[[PS269|Return to Pallet Town]]'' and Organism No. 2 first appeared in ''[[PS275|A Vicious Cycle of Possibilities]]''. [[Team Rocket]] sought Organism No. 2 for their own purposes, with {{adv|Giovanni}} eventually {{pkmn2|Caught|catching}} it and using it to fight {{adv|Red}} and {{adv|Mewtwo}} aboard the [[Team Rocket airship]]. Organism No. 1 briefly returned in the {{MangaArc|Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire}}, being responsible for the [[Grand Meteor Delta]]'s near-collision with the planet.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Deoxys (TCG)}}

==Other appearances==
===[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]===
[[File:Deoxys SSBB.png|220px|thumb|left|Deoxys in Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]
An Attack Forme Deoxys will sometimes be released from a {{i|Poké Ball}}. It floats towards the top of the screen and does a spin. It will then shoot a powerful {{m|Hyper Beam}}, drawing in all the opponents near it and sending them flying. Coming in contact with Deoxys's body will do damage.

====Trophy information====
''A DNA Pokémon born through the mutation of the DNA of a space virus. It has multiple Formes, and the abilities it possesses and the techniques it can remember change from forme to forme. It has four forms: normal, attack, defense, and speed. It can be made to change forms by using the power of a meteorite in [[Veilstone City]].''

===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U]]===
[[File:Deoxys SSB4.png|220px|thumb|right|Deoxys in Super Smash Bros. for 3DS]]
[[File:Deoxys_3DS_trophy_SSB4.png|thumb|left|150px|Deoxys trophy in ''Super Smash Bros. for 3DS'']]
Deoxys appears as a Poké Ball summon in the 3DS and Wii U versions of the game, its behavior unchanged from ''Brawl''. It also appears as a trophy in both versions of the game.

====Trophy information====
'''NA:''' ''This Psychic-type Pokémon was born from a virus attached to a meteorite. It has four different Formes, but in Smash Bros. only the Attack Forme appears. In battle, it'll soar skyward before unleashing a powerful Hyper Beam attack straight downward from the crystal in its chest.''

'''PAL:''' ''Deoxys was formed from a mutated virus that came to Earth on a meteorite. It comes in four different Formes, but in this game, it appears in Attack Forme. When summoned, it heads skywards before firing its Hyper Beam attack straight downwards from the crystal in its chest.''
{{left clear}}

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Deoxys appears as a Poké Ball summon, retaining the same behavior from the previous games. It also appears as a {{sbw|Spirit}} in Normal Forme.

==Trivia==
* Deoxys was the first [[Mythical Pokémon]] to not have exactly 100 points in each of its base stats.
* Speed Forme Deoxys has the highest base {{stat|Speed}} stat of all {{type|Psychic}} Pokémon.
* Defense Forme Deoxys has the highest base {{stat|Special Defense}} stat of all Psychic-type Pokémon.
* Attack Forme Deoxys is tied with {{p|Caterpie}}, {{p|Weedle}}, {{p|Magikarp}}, {{p|Igglybuff}}, {{p|Carvanha}}, and {{p|Stonjourner}} for having the lowest base Special Defense stat of all Pokémon.
** Its Attack Forme also has the lowest base Special Defense stat of all Psychic-type Pokémon.
* Deoxys is the only Pokémon whose Forme change is triggered by different events between [[generation]]s.
* Deoxys is one of two Pokémon in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red and Blue Rescue Team that has defenses over 100 at level 100 if not given any vitamins or [[Gummi]]s, the other being {{p|Lugia}}.
* In {{vg|Pokémon Ranger}}, Deoxys's Forme changes every time its [[List of Pokémon by Fiore Browser number|Browser]] entry is accessed. It cycles in order from Normal Forme to Attack Forme to Defense Forme to Speed Forme and finally back to Normal Forme.
* In the {{pkmn|animated series}} and related media, including the {{pkmn|movie}} ''[[M07|Destiny Deoxys]]'', as well as in {{vg|Pokémon Ranger}}, Deoxys is able to change Formes at will regardless of where it is. While it can willingly change Forme in [[Pokémon Adventures]], its choices are limited by the environment.
* Due to the cause of Forme change in [[Generation III]] being the game Deoxys is in, ''only'' Speed Forme Deoxys is banned from the {{gdis|Battle Frontier|III}}, as only Speed Forme Deoxys is obtainable in Emerald.
* In the games, the [[Sevii Islands]] and [[Orre]]{{tt|*|excluding multiplayer modes in XD}} are the only regions where all four Formes have not been available.
* Deoxys was the first Pokémon to have its own unique battle music.
* Using the first letters from the names of Deoxys's three debut Formes, one can spell "DNA" ('''D'''efense, '''N'''ormal, '''A'''ttack). This is reflected in Deoxys's Pokédex entry in {{g|GO}}, which orders its Formes on a list as such: Defense, Normal, Attack, Speed.
* Before [[Generation V]], Deoxys was the only Pokémon whose stats were recalculated (to apply gained [[effort values|effort points]] to its stats) immediately after a battle. Other Pokémon had to level up, use the [[box trick]], or be fed a [[vitamin]] or [[effort values#Generation III|stat-reducing Berry]] in order to have the effort values applied to their stats.
* When in the wild, or while looking at a Deoxys belonging to another player (e.g. while trading), it will appear in its Normal Forme in Generation III.
* Deoxys was designed by [[Hironobu Yoshida]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100111034554/http://www.go-pokemon.com/op/news/articles/16.html Pokémon Creators, Artists at the World Championships - Go-Pokemon.com] (archive)</ref><ref>[https://www.pokemon.com/us/play-pokemon/worlds/2014/info/vips/ 2014 Pokémon World Championships VIPs | The Official Pokémon Website]</ref>
* Deoxys was the first Mythical Pokémon to be obtainable in-game in the core series without any event or distribution (in {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}). Possibly as a result, [http://www.pokemoncenter.com/info/Pokemon_Characters PokémonCenter.com] and a [[Scholastic]] book on {{pkmn2|Legendary}} and Mythical Pokémon erroneously call Deoxys a Legendary Pokémon rather than a Mythical Pokémon.
** In [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa08Y-fhfTI a YouTube video celebrating the number of Pokémon] after the release of [[Generation IX]], Deoxys is listed with Legendary Pokémon and not with Mythical Pokémon.
* Deoxys is the only Pokémon whose Japanese {{pkmn|category}} name is written with characters from a foreign alphabet, being {{tt|DNAポケモン|DNA Pokémon}}.
* A cryptographic cipher named <code>Deoxys-II</code>, after the Pokémon,<ref>[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OAq7Jb-WuUDeLF1XCNZLj9DlTFz9YVdU/view Deoxys - Jérémy Jean, Ivica Nikolić, Thomas Peyrin, Yannick Seurin | DIAC 2016]</ref> was selected as a finalist in the {{wp|CAESAR Competition}}.
* Deoxys and {{p|Spinda}} are the only Pokémon to lack a second frame of animation for their front sprite in {{pkmn|Emerald|Pokémon Emerald}}. In Deoxys's case, this applies to both its Normal and Speed Formes.
* Deoxys was the first Pokémon to share its name with an English [[EX Deoxys (TCG)|TCG expansion]], the only other Pokémon being [[Platinum: Arceus (TCG)|Arceus]].

===Origin===
Deoxys appears to draw inspiration from certain representations of {{wp|alien}}s and visual representations of the {{wp|nucleic acid double helix}}. It may also be more loosely based on {{wp|virus}}es and {{wp|mutation}}. It also strongly resembles the shape of a {{wp|chromosome}}, a package containing much of the {{wp|DNA}} of an organism. This makes sense due to its ability to duplicate, just like a chromosome does during {{wp|cell division}}.

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule composed of two polynucleotide chains that coil around each other to form a double helix carrying genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth and reproduction of all known organisms and many viruses. Normal Forme Deoxys's arms can sometimes be seen as represented by overlapping helix strands, which resemble the double helix coil of DNA.

Deoxys' association with meteorites, and its Pokédex entries which state that it is "an alien virus that fell to earth on a meteor", suggest links to the fringe scientific concept of {{wp|panspermia}} (the concept that life itself is extraterrestrial in origin, and arrived on Earth through celestial objects such as bacteria-contaminated meteorites) and its more concretely proven counterpart {{wp|pseudo-panspermia}} (the concept that the basic building blocks for life, such as {{wp|amino acid}}s, originated in space and arrived on Earth through celestial objects).

====Name origin====
Deoxys is derived from ''{{wp|DNA|deoxyribonucleic acid}}''—or ''DNA''—the medium of genetic code in cellular organisms.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20230508162421/https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/9-12/features/F_Pokemon_9-12.html Catch the Latest Pokémon!] NASA, 3 March 2005 (archived May 8, 2023).</ref>
