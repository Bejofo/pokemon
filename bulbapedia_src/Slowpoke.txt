'''Slowpoke''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ヤドン''' ''Yadon'') is a dual-type {{2t|Water|Psychic}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Slowbro}} starting at [[level]] 37 or {{p|Slowking}} when [[Trade Evolution|traded]] while holding a [[King's Rock]].

In [[Galar]], Slowpoke has a pure {{type|Psychic}} [[regional form]], introduced in {{g|Sword and Shield}}'s 1.1.0 patch. It evolves into either {{rf|Galarian}} Slowbro when exposed to a [[Galarica Cuff]] or Galarian Slowking when exposed to a [[Galarica Wreath]]. These Slowpoke can also be found in [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]].

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for these details.)

==Biology==
Slowpoke is a pink {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that resembles a cross between a {{wp|salamander}} and a {{wp|hippopotamus}}. It has vacant eyes that never seem focused, curled ears, and a rounded, tan muzzle. It has four legs, each of which ends in a single white claw. Its long, tapering tail has a white tip. This tail drips a sweet, sappy substance that is attractive to many species of fish. Slowpoke uses the tail as a fishing lure. The tail often breaks off, but it will grow back. [[Slowpoke Tail|Slowpoke tails]] are considered a delicacy and commonly used as a cooking ingredient: in [[Alola]], they are often dried and used in home-cooked stews, while in [[Galar]], [[Smoke-Poke Tail|they are smoked and packaged]] as a [[curry]] ingredient. Slowpoke is also known to dive underwater to hunt, but is often itself caught instead.

Slowpoke has a notoriously dim intellect and often forgets what it was doing. It takes a long time to respond to outside stimuli. For example, it can take up to five seconds to process pain and can take an entire day to notice when its tail has been bitten. Slowpoke is commonly found at the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Water's-edge Pokémon|water's edge}}. In some places, it is believed that Slowpoke's yawn causes rain. This Pokémon is worshiped in those areas. Its vacant expression is said to help some people relax, whilst causing irritation to others. It is posited that those who lead hectic lives are most likely to become relaxed. As mentioned in [[Pokémon Sleep]], researchers have debated if Slowpoke is either awake or asleep while it stands around doing nothing.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref>

===Forms===
Slowpoke has a regional form: {{rf|Galarian}} Slowpoke.

{{rf|Galarian}} Slowpoke's body is a slightly different shade of pink, and it has gained yellow colorations on its forehead and tail. This tail is always down and is said to have a spicy taste. 

Galarian Slowpoke's diet consists of eating spices. Much like its Kantonian counterpart, Galarian Slowpoke is known to relax on seashores and riverbanks without a care in the world. However, sometimes it will get a very sharp look in its eyes as if it is about to think of something tremendous, although it will quickly forget and return to its normal expression afterward.

It is believed that this behavior, along with the spicy taste of its tail, is a result of Galarica particles built up from its diet of native [[Galarica Twig|Galarica]] seeds affecting its brain and body.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/expansionpass/pokemon/slowpoke/ Galarian Slowpoke Discovered | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref> This diet also affects Slowpoke's two different Evolutions, including the {{p|Shellder}} that attaches to it, which is induced by either the [[Galarica Cuff]] or the [[Galarica Wreath]]. Due to the scent of the spice emanating from its tail, the Galarian Slowpoke often has difficulties while fishing. They can also be found in the [[Coastal Biome]] of [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]], where Galar's regional life is simulated.

===Evolution===
Slowpoke evolves into either {{p|Slowbro}} or {{p|Slowking}}.

{{rf|Galarian}} Slowpoke evolves into either Galarian Slowbro or Galarian Slowking.

===Evolution data===
====Slowpoke====
Slowpoke [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Slowbro}} starting at [[level]] 37 or {{p|Slowking}} when [[Trade Evolution|traded]] while holding a [[King's Rock]].

Slowpoke appears as a Master {{sbw|Spirits (characters)|Spirit}}. Unlike other Master Spirits who own dojos, his dojo specifically allows spirits to forget styles that they have learned from other dojos.

===Celestial===
Slowpoke appeared in the music video for [[Celestial]].

==Trivia==
[[File:Bandai Aerodactyl card.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Ken Sugimori]] artwork showing Slowpoke's striped underside]]
* In the [[Generation I]] games, Slowpoke, {{p|Rhyhorn}}, and {{p|Magikarp}} are the only Pokémon to have their [[List of Pokémon icons in Generations I and II|icon]] changed upon [[Evolution]].
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Slowpoke was originally known as "Slowmo".
* The Japanese and international versions of {{game|Gold and Silver|s|Pokémon Silver}} have different sprites for Slowpoke, with the Japanese versions having a fatter and striped belly similar to that which {{p|Slowbro}} and {{p|Slowking}} sport. It is unknown why this was changed. However, its striped underside is still partially visible in all of its Gold and {{v2|Crystal}} sprites. This striped belly does not appear to be a true error, as it has been seen in artwork by [[Ken Sugimori]], though it is from Generation I.
* Like {{p|Mantyke}}, Slowpoke [[Evolution|evolves]] when another Pokémon is attached to it; however, this does not occur in the [[core series]] games, but has been shown in {{spin-off games}} such as {{g|Snap}}, as well as in {{aniseries|PTS}}. Proximity-based Evolution, such as requiring Mantyke and {{p|Remoraid}} to be in the same party, were not introduced until [[Generation IV]].
* Slowpoke is the only Pokémon whose multiple Evolutions have different total [[EV yield]]s: Slowbro has an EV yield of 2, while Slowking has an EV yield of 3.
* Despite numerous [[Pokédex entry|Pokédex entries]] stating its lack of response to a bite on its tail, in Pokémon Snap it is shown to quickly react to Shellder's bite. This may be due to Shellder's venom stimulating a quicker response, or simply an oversight, if not an intentional game mechanic to speed the process along.
* The Pokémon Company posted a Slowpoke-themed reggae music video onto their Japanese channel titled どないやねん ヤドン (What's Going on, Yadon?). The song was later dubbed and posted to the English-language channel under the title of [[Slowpoke Song]].
* Though the species has appeared repeatedly, no Slowpoke has ever been seen using an attack in the animated series.
* Slowpoke has the lowest base {{stat|Speed}} stat of all {{type|Psychic}} Pokémon.
** It also has the lowest base Speed stat of all Pokémon introduced in Generation I.
* Slowpoke has the fewest move differences between [[regional form]]s, having almost identical learnsets with only two differences. The [[Galarian form]] learns {{m|Acid}} instead of {{m|Water Gun}} at level 6 and can learn [[TR81]], {{m|Foul Play}}. However, in [[Generation IX]], both forms are able to learn [[TM062]] Foul Play, resulting in there only being one difference between their learnsets.
* Slowpoke is the only Pokémon with a regional form with a branched Evolution.
** It is also the only Pokémon to not only not gain a new [[type]] in its regional form, but also lose one type without changing the other.
* When Galarian Slowpoke was first released, it could use [[Eviolite]] despite being unable to evolve at the time (possibly because its Evolutions were still programmed in or planned).
* Galarian Slowpoke is the only Pokémon with a branched Evolution where both evolved forms share identical type combinations with each other, but not their pre-evolved form.
* Unlike most regional forms, Galarian Slowpoke has a different cry from its regular form.
* Slowpoke, its Galarian form, and their evolved forms are the only Psychic-type Pokémon in the {{egg3|Monster}}.
* Galarian Slowpoke is the first regional form Pokémon to be added in an update.
* Galarian Slowpoke is the first [[Galarian form]] that can be caught outside of [[Galar]].

===Origin===
{{bulbanews|On the Origin of Species: Slowpoke, Slowbro and Slowking}}
Slowpoke's appearance may be based on {{wp|hippopotamus}}es and {{wp|giant salamander}}s. Due to its marine nature, physical appearance, and association with {{wp|shellfish}}, Slowpoke may also be based on a {{wp|sea otter}}. Its ability to grow a new tail if it is cut off may be inspired by the biological processes of {{wp|autotomy}} and {{wp|regeneration (biology)|regeneration}} seen in some species of {{wp|lizard}}s and {{wp|salamander}}s.

====Name origin====
Slowpoke is literally ''slowpoke'', a term for someone who is slow.

Yadon may be a combination of 宿借り ''yadokari'' ({{wp|hermit crab}}), 宿主 ''yadonushi'' (parasitic host), and 鈍 ''don'' (dull). It may also be a shortening of ヤドラン  ''Yadoran'', {{p|Slowbro}}'s Japanese name.
