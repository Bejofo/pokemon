'''Arcanine''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ウインディ''' ''Windie'') is a {{type|Fire}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Growlithe}} when exposed to a [[Fire Stone]].

In [[Hisui]], Arcanine has a dual-type {{2t|Fire|Rock}} [[regional form]]. It evolves from Hisuian {{p|Growlithe}} when exposed to a Fire Stone.

==Biology==
Arcanine is a quadrupedal, {{wp|canidae|canine}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with an orange pelt marked by jagged black stripes. It has diamond-shaped ears with beige insides, black eyes, a round, black nose, and two pointed teeth protruding from its upper jaw. Its head, muzzle, and chest are covered in shaggy, beige fur, except for two oval sections around each eye and ear. Long tufts of fur grow behind its elbows and around its ankles. Its underside is black, and it has a billowing, beige tail that is bent in the middle. Each paw has three toes and a round, pink pad.

Arcanine is a fiercely brave and loyal Pokémon. It is capable of running {{tt|6,200 miles|10,000 kilometers}} in 24 hours with a speed and grace reminiscent of flight. In [[Generation II]], {{m|Extreme Speed}} was its [[signature move]]. Arcanine has long been admired for its beauty and speed, and anyone who hears its bark will grovel before it. The source of its power is a flame blazing wildly inside its body. Being the result of an [[Evolution]] via [[Evolution stone]], Arcanine is rarely found in the wild, but when found, it is usually seen living in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|prairies}}, and [[Pokémon Snap]] has also shown it living in active volcanoes. In the ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' episode ''[[AG139|On Cloud Arcanine]]'', it was shown that it stashes food in its mane and carries it to its nest for its young. As shown in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Arcanine is known to sleep at supremely comfortable sleeping spot.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref> Arcanine when it sleeps is said to be similar to how an innocent child sleeps.

In some locations, such as [[Pokémon world in relation to the real world#Real-world locations mentioned|China]], Arcanine is seen as a [[Legendary Pokémon]], where it's revered for its speed and power; it is also categorized as Legendary in [[An Illustrated Book of POCKET MONSTERS]].

===Forms===
Arcanine has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Hisuian}} Arcanine.

In [[Hisui]], Arcanine has a different look due to the volcanic activity of the environment it lives in. Its body fur is red-orange while its muzzle, mane, tail, eyebrows, and tufts of fur behind its elbows and around its ankles are gray, and the insides of its ears are light gray. The gray fur is made out of igneous rock components. Its cheek mane, ankle fur, and tail form into curls. Its elbow fur resemble wings. It has a large horn in the center of its head and three small horns between its head and ears. Its mane form into curled clumps at the back of its neck and large rectangular clumps on the sides and bottom of its neck. The rectangular clumps have light red-orange markings on them.

Hisuian Arcanine uses its fangs while engulfed in flames to snap at foes. Despite how deceivingly bulky Hisuian Arcanine is, it moves around nimbly like a dancer. This allows it to lead opponents in a merry chase while avoiding them at the same time. It lives in coastal mountainsides.

A special Hisuian Arcanine is worshiped by the Hisui people due to him being descended from one of the 10 ancient Pokémon who received a blessing from {{p|Arceus}}. He is one of the [[noble Pokémon]] who resides in [[Cobalt Coastlands]] watched by a [[Warden]] [[Palina]].

===Evolution===
Arcanine evolves from {{p|Growlithe}}.

{{rf|Hisuian}} Arcanine evolves from Hisuian Growlithe.

===NPC appearances===
* [[Pokémon Legends: Arceus]]: Two [[Noble Pokémon|Hisuian Arcanine]] are supporting characters, one of which is a {{DL|Appendix:Fan terminology|boss}}. These Arcanine are father and son, with the father having died to save his pup. Later on, the son evolved and took his father's place as a [[Noble Pokémon]].

They were beloved by the people of the [[Hisui]] region along with the other Noble and [[Ride Pokémon (Hisui)|Ride Pokémon]].

====Major appearances====
=====[[Gary's Arcanine]]=====
Arcanine debuted in ''[[EP063|The Battle Of The Badge]]'', under the ownership of {{Gary}}, who was first seen using it against {{an|Giovanni}} in a [[Gym]] {{pkmn|battle}}.

It has made multiple reappearances since then as one of Gary's most commonly used Pokémon.

=====Other=====
In ''[[EP076|Fire and Ice]]'', [[Pete Pebbleman]] used an Arcanine during his battle against {{Ash}} at the [[Indigo Plateau Conference]].

==Trivia==
[[File:Legendary Pokémon engravings EP002.png|thumb|250px|Engravings of "Legendary Pokémon" {{p|Moltres}}, {{p|Articuno}}, {{p|Zapdos}}, and Arcanine in ''[[EP002|Pokémon Emergency!]]'']]
* Arcanine has the highest base stat total of any Pokémon which has [[Evolution|evolved]] by [[Evolution stone]].
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Arcanine was originally known as ''Blaze''.
* Despite the [[Pokémon category]] name, Arcanine is not an actual [[Legendary Pokémon]]. It is the only Pokémon species to have "Legendary Pokémon" as the Pokémon category.
** However, Arcanine was seen in an engraving along with [[legendary birds]] {{p|Moltres}}, {{p|Articuno}}, and {{p|Zapdos}} in ''[[EP002|Pokémon Emergency!]]''.
* Many of Arcanine's [[Pokédex entry|Pokédex entries]]—starting with the one in the Japanese {{game|Red and Green|s|Pokémon Red}}—[[Pokémon world in relation to the real world|reference the real world]], specifically {{wp|China}}.
* Arcanine and its pre-evolved form are the only Pokémon with a [[List of Pokémon by gender ratio|male-female ratio of 3:1]] that aren't in the {{egg3|Human-Like}}.
* Hisuian Arcanine and its pre-evolved form were designed by [[Megumi Mizutani]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/megtany/status/1500305951479324673 Tweet by 水谷恵 (@megtany).] Posted on March 6, 2022.</ref>
* In {{g|Legends: Arceus}}'s internal code, Hisuian Arcanine's [[Hidden Ability]] is {{a|Justified}} instead of {{a|Rock Head}}.

===Origin===
Arcanine may be based on the {{wp|Ryukuan people|Ryukyuan}} シーサー ''{{wp|shisa}}'', or 狛犬 ''{{wp|komainu}}'', mythical creatures that resemble a mix between {{wp|lion}}s and {{wp|dog}}s, who are often depicted with dragon-like features. Given its earliest Pokédex entries state it's from China, however, it may more precisely derive from the 獅 ''{{wp|Chinese guardian lion}}''. Statues of ''komainu'' in pairs are used as guardians that invite good spirits and repel evil ones. Its stripes and coloration are reminiscent of {{wp|tiger}}s. It could also be based on the ''{{wp|xiezhi}}'', a mythical fire-eating dog with similarities to lions and tigers. It may also draw inspiration from dogs with brindle ("tiger-striped") coat patterns, such as the 甲斐犬 {{wp|Kai Ken}}.

In its Hisuian Form, its {{t|Rock}} typing and appearance may be based on the ''komainu'' statues. Its ankle fur and tail resemble {{wp|Plume (fluid dynamics)|plume}}s of smoke.

====Name origin====
Arcanine may be a combination of ''arcane'' and ''{{wp|canine}}''.

Windie may refer to ''wind'' or ''windy'', reflecting its defining nature of being fast like the wind, further emphasized by {{m|Extreme Speed}} being its [[signature move]] in [[Generation II]].
