'''Dragonite''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''カイリュー''' ''Kairyu'') is a dual-type {{2t|Dragon|Flying}} [[pseudo-legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Dragonair}} starting at [[level]] 55. It is the final form of {{p|Dratini}}. 

Dragonite will be able to [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Dragonite''' in the upcoming game {{g|Legends: Z-A}}.

==Biology==
[[File:Dragon Fossil Adventures.png|thumb|left|230px|The skeleton of a Dragonite in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
Dragonite is a {{wp|dragon|draconic}}, bipedal {{wp|reptile|reptilian}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with light orange skin. It has large, grayish-green eyes and a round snout with small nostrils. A pair of long, thin antennae sprout from the top of its head with a small horn set between them. Its striated underbelly is cream-colored and extends from its neck to the tip of its long, tapering tail. It has thick arms and legs ending in three claws each. The leg joints are well defined, while its arms have a smooth, rounded appearance. Dragonite's wings are small relative to its body with teal wing membranes. As mentioned in {{g|Sleep}}, Dragonite is known to sleep soundly while displaying its belly.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref> This rare sight is said to be an exhausted Dragonite resting after flying over the vast seas.

Despite its bulky build, Dragonite is capable of flying faster than the speed of sound, being able to circle the globe in sixteen hours. A kind-hearted Pokémon with human-like intelligence, Dragonite shows signs of altruism: it is said to save humans from drowning and lead lost or foundering ships to safety. As demonstrated in ''[[EP253|Great Bowls of Fire!]]'', however, it will go on an uncontrollable, destructive rampage if its environment is threatened. Dragonite will usually calm down and be satisfied after smashing down anything that has angered it to smithereens. It is known to engage in fierce battles with {{p|Kingdra}} whenever they meet. Dragonite has been referred to as the "sea guardian" and the "Sea Incarnate"; as such, there are many ships with figureheads decorated with Dragonite's look. [[Drayden]] stated in ''[[JN065|Thrash of the Titans!]]'' that Dragonite's power is capable of affecting the weather. In [[Fiore]], Dragonite used by {{OBP|Pokémon Ranger|Ranger series}}s to travel to different areas in the region, this flying service is called the ''Dragonite Bus''. Dragonite is very rare in the wild, typically {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Water's-edge Pokémon|living near the sea}}. Some claim that there is [[Dragonite Island|an island]] somewhere in the ocean that only Dragonite inhabit.

In [[Generation II]], Dragonite and its pre-evolved forms were the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Outrage}}, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via {{pkmn|breeding}}.

===Forms===
[[File:Ult Mega Dragonite Hyper Beam.png|thumb|right|250px|Mega Dragonite firing a {{m|Hyper Beam}} from the pearl near the tip of its tail]]
Dragonite can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Dragonite.

As Mega Dragonite, it gains features that are distinctive of {{p|Dragonair}}.<ref name=ZAsite/> Dragonite's antennae grows into large feathery wings on its head, which are light tan in color with white tips. These head wings function as feelers, while also allowing Mega Dragonite to fly.<ref name=ZAsite/> Conversely, the wings on its back have shrunk and become purely teal. Feathery wing-like structures also sprout from Mega Dragonite's shoulders and legs. Mega Dragonite's tail is longer and has a multi-colored pearl near the tip; this pearl glows when Mega Dragonite performs certain attacks. Mega Dragonite's horn is white and now located on its forehead, and it has teal-green eyes. Its cream-colored underbelly no longer extends to its tail, and the numerous straight lines segmenting it are replaced with only five V-shaped ones.

Mega Dragonite's speed and strength have increased significantly from its regular form, but it has retained its kindness and helpful nature. Its kindness makes it prefer to end matches quickly, smiling as it attacks its opponents with powerful attacks. Likewise, it will rush to help someone it senses to be in trouble, even while it is battling.<ref name=ZAsite>[https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/story-world/pokemon/mega-dragonite Pokémon Legends: Z-A | Mega Dragonite] — Pokémon Official Website</ref> As seen in the {{aniseries|HZ}} episode [[HZ107]], Mega Dragonite can fire moves like {{m|Hyper Beam}} from the pearl near the tip of its tail. According to the [[Mega Nidothing's Mega Mega! Mega Evolution]] short in [[HZ111]], Mega Dragonite possesses the power to blast through mountains, causing significant destruction in the process.

====Trophy information====
'''NA:''' ''Dragonite are known for their helpfulness toward people at sea, searching for drowning sailors or leading lost ships back to shore. This is probably why so many are quick to praise Dragonite for their kindness! In battle, though, Dragonite uses its strong body combined with quick moves. Don't worry - win or lose, it'll be friendly when the battle is over.''

'''PAL:''' ''A benevolent Pokémon said to search the ocean for drowning swimmers and guide damaged ships to shore. Because of this, many people venerate Dragonite as a guardian of the sea. In battle, on the other hand, it's a fearsome foe, soaring rapidly through the air to deliver incredible attacks. Let's be thankful it's usually friendly.''

* Mega Dragonite was the first Mega Evolved Pokémon to be introduced after [[Generation VI]]. 

===Cultural impact===
The design of Dragonite has been compared by Chinese Pokémon fans to the {{wp|Moomins}}, a Finnish story series. The phrase 快龍就是嚕嚕米 ''Kuailong jiùshì Lǔlǔmǐ'' (lit. "Dragonite is Moomins") is a meme among Chinese fans, and was even shown on the side of the {{wp|Taipei 101}} during the 2023-24 New Year's Countdown in Taiwan.<ref>(January 3, 2024). "[https://tech.udn.com/tech/story/123154/7680001 影／寶可夢快龍獲「台灣最高認證」！台北101外牆1句話讓網笑翻：新年就被臭]." 科技玩家 (Tech.UDN.com)</ref>

===Origin===
Dragonite resembles a classic {{wp|European dragon}}. Its description as the "guardian of the sea" may also suggest it has elements similar to the {{wp|Chinese dragon|Chinese}} and {{wp|Japanese dragon}}s.

Mega Dragonite's design incorporates features from its pre-Evolution {{p|Dragonair}}, namely the head wings and the pearl on its tail.<ref name=ZAsite/> Its design may also invoke {{wp|angel}}s — the six wings Mega Dragonite gains upon Mega Evolving may reference the {{wp|seraph}}im, a type of angel described in the Christian Bible to have six wings, with two wings covering its face and two wings covering its feet.

====Name origin====
Dragonite may be a combination of ''{{wp|dragon}}'' and ''{{wp|knight}}'', ''night'', or ''draconite'' (a mythical stone said to be found in the heads of dragons and are pyramidal in shape, similar to Dragonite's horn).

Kairyu may be derived from 海竜 ''kairyū'' (sea dragon). It may also involve 怪獣 ''kaijū'' (monster), 快 ''kai'' (cheerful), and 破壊 ''hakai'' (destruction).
