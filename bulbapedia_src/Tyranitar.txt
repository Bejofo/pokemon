'''Tyranitar''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''バンギラス''' ''Bangiras'') is a dual-type {{2t|Rock|Dark}} [[pseudo-legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation II]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Pupitar}} starting at [[level]] 55. It is the final form of {{p|Larvitar}}.

Tyranitar can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Tyranitar''' using the [[Tyranitarite]].

The [[Paradox Pokémon]] {{p|Iron Thorns}} is said to be either a future relative of Tyranitar or a counterpart of it from a parallel timeline.

==Biology==
Tyranitar is a large, bipedal, dinosaurian {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a green, armor-like hide covering its body. It has two pairs of pointed teeth: one in the upper jaw and one in the lower. Several spikes of varying sizes protrude from the back of its head, neck, and shoulders. Both sides of its chest, the center of its back, and its knees have two triangular holes. There is a gray, diamond-shaped patch of scales covering its belly and a smaller one on its back. It has three claws on its feet and hands. A ring of spikes surrounds the tip of its tail.

Tyranitar is a powerful Pokémon with an insolent nature, uncaring of others. It is extremely strong, and its thick, rocky hide gives it good resistance to all forms of attack. As mentioned in {{g|Sleep}}, Tyranitar can often be seen sleeping in a relaxed position with its limbs spread wide, unconcerned about its surroundings due to its overwhelming power and strong, armored body.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref> As a result, Tyranitar is always looking for a battle and will not flinch at anything, though it ignores opponents that it thinks are not worth its time.

Tyranitar's power is so great that it can forcefully crush anything using one of its hands. If enraged, Tyranitar sets off outstanding earthquakes that can completely change the entire landscape, destroying houses and mountains, burying rivers, and often forcing cartographers to draw up new maps. It lives in nests made from demolished {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Mountain Pokémon|mountains}}. In the [[Galar]] [[region]], it has a fierce rivalry with {{p|Duraludon}}, which it shares its habitat with, often battling each other in the mountains.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon-galar-region/duraludon/ Duraludon |Official Website |Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref> {{p|Iron Thorns}} is believed to be a relative of Tyranitar from one billion years in the future.

Prior to [[Generation IV]], Tyranitar was the [[signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that could have {{a|Sand Stream}} as an [[Ability]].

===Forms===
Tyranitar can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Tyranitar.

Mega Tyranitar has more gaps in its armor than its normal form, with four new triangular holes along the sides of its neck and one on its throat. The four holes on its chest are now larger with the top two containing red ovals. While the spikes along the back of its neck grow shorter, the ones on its head elongate to form prominent ridges along its brows. The center spike on its head becomes a long, upright horn. Its chest plate expands, curving over its shoulders and along its back to form three long, irregular spikes on each side of its body. The scales on Mega Tyranitar's belly have now become red instead of blue and seethe with energy, enabling it to emanate more power.<ref>http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/pokemon/mega_pokemon/#Tyranitar</ref> It gains two sharp spikes on its knees, as well as more prominent leg joints. Its tail lengthens, with the three spikes surrounding its tip growing upward and outward. Its back had split open because of the overwhelming power from Mega Evolution. As a Mega Tyranitar, its instincts have only become more destructive, to the point where it may not even be able to hear its Trainer's orders.

====Major appearances====
=====[[Team A.C.T.]]=====
A Tyranitar was a member of [[Team A.C.T.]], who was considered for the job of rescuing Big Brother {{p|Pikachu}} in ''[[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Team Go-Getters Out of the Gate!]]''. They were, however, occupied on another mission.

=====Other=====
Tyranitar debuted in ''[[M04|Celebi: The Voice of the Forest]]'', where it was caught in a [[Dark Ball]] and used by the [[Iron-Masked Marauder]] in his quest to capture {{OBP|Celebi|M04}}.

Tyranitar made its animated series debut in ''[[EP263|Address Unown]]'', where {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}}, who were in {{AP|Larvitar}}'s mind, saw her in Larvitar's memory of being separated from its Tyranitar mother. Larvitar returned to its mother in [[EP264|the following episode]].

In ''[[AG006|A Poached Ego!]]'', [[Rico]]'s Pupitar evolved into a Tyranitar and immediately attacked {{TRT}} while trying to steal {{TP|Jessie|Arbok}}, {{TP|James|Weezing}}, and the horde of {{p|Ekans}} and {{p|Koffing}} that Rico had been seeking. However, Team Rocket fought back, giving Arbok, Weezing, and the Ekans and Koffing enough time to escape. Tyranitar was eventually taken care of by [[Officer Jenny's Growlithe]].

In ''[[Mewtwo — Prologue to Awakening]]'', [[Dirk]] used a Tyranitar against {{OBP|Mewtwo|M16}}. It eventually escaped when Mewtwo crushed its {{i|Poké Ball}}.

A Tyranitar that can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Tyranitar appeared in ''[[XYS03|Mega Evolution Special III]]''.

==Trivia==
[[File:Magazine Tyranitar.png|thumb|150px|Monster design by Ken Sugimori, published in April 1997<ref name=MicroDesign/>]]
* No other Pokémon has the same [[type]] [[List of Pokémon with unique type combinations|combination]] as Tyranitar.
* Tyranitar is the only {{type|Dark}} Pokémon in the {{egg3|Monster}}.
* Tyranitar shares its {{pkmn|category}} name with {{p|Donphan}}. They are both known as the Armor Pokémon.
* [[Mega Evolution|Mega]] Tyranitar is tied with Mega {{p|Diancie}} for the highest base stat total of all {{type|Rock}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} and it also has the highest base stat total of all {{type|Dark}} Pokémon (excluding an {{P|Arceus}} holding a [[Stone Plate]] or a [[Dread Plate]]).
** Mega Tyranitar has the highest base {{stat|Attack}} and {{stat|Defense}} stats of all Dark-type Pokémon.
* Tyranitar's design heavily resembles a monster design illustrated by [[Ken Sugimori]] for Volume 14 of MicroDesign Publishing's ''Bimonthly Game Review'' (Japanese: 隔月刊ゲーム批評) magazine, published in April 1997. According to Sugimori, the monster design was meant to be an original creation unrelated to Pokémon.<ref name=MicroDesign>''Bimonthly Game Review'' magazine, Vol. 14 (April 1997). ''MicroDesign Publishing''. ([https://web.archive.org/web/20160308190849/http://www.hairyticksofdune.net/dropbox/sugimori.html transcript with English translations]; Plague von Karma's [https://imgur.com/FFLW01B scan with English translations] and [https://plaguevonkarmabeta.weebly.com/blog/microgroup-game-review-vol14-sugimori-retranslated translator notes])</ref>

===Origin===
<!--Do NOT mention Godzilla. Referencing the genre is fine, but not the specific character.-->

Tyranitar's design may have drawn inspiration from the ''{{wp|kaiju}}'' genre; its upright posture may allude to how most ''kaiju'' are humanoid in shape, due to the need to fit a person inside the suit. Mega Tyranitar's back splitting open and green coloration may be based on an insect emerging from its cocoon. 

Another influence it may have is with the {{wp|Armadillo girdled lizard}}, a desert-dwelling lizard mainly distinguished by its especially firm scales, or certain {{wp|Theropoda|theropod}} dinosaurs.

====Name origin====
Tyranitar may be derived from ''tyrant'' or ''{{wp|Tyrannosaurus}}'' (both derived from the same root), and ''{{wp|tar}}'' (alluding to the misconception of petroleum and tar originating from dinosaurs) or ''{{wp|Reptar}}''. It may also involve ''{{wp|Tarasque}}''.

Bangiras may be a combination of 野蛮 ''yaban'' (savage) or 蛮 ''ban'' (barbarian), 嫌い ''kirai'' (hated), and ソーラス ''sōrasu'', a corruption of サウルス ''saurusu'' (''-saurus'', Greek-derived suffix for dinosaur names).
