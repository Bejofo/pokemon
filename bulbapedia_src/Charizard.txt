'''Charizard''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''リザードン''' ''Lizardon'') is a dual-type {{2t|Fire|Flying}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Charmeleon}} starting at [[level]] 36. It is the final form of {{p|Charmander}}.

Charizard has three forms: '''Mega Charizard X''', '''Mega Charizard Y''', and '''Gigantamax Charizard'''. It can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Charizard X using the [[Charizardite X]] and Mega Charizard Y using the [[Charizardite Y]], and can [[Gigantamax]] into Gigantamax Charizard if it has the {{DL|Gigantamax|Gigantamax Factor}}.

Charizard is the [[game mascot]] of {{game|Red and Blue|s|Pokémon Red}} and its [[remake]] {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s|Pokémon FireRed}}, appearing on the boxart of both games.

Along with {{p|Pikachu}}, {{p|Talonflame}}, and {{p|Decidueye}}, Charizard is one of the four [[First partner Pokémon|partner Pokémon]]  available through the Unite Licenses in [[Pokémon UNITE]] as of version 1.12.1.2.

==Biology==
[[File:Professor Oak Lecture EP161.png|200px|thumb|left|Charizard's tail flame burning blue after Professor Oak accidentally steps on its tail]]
Charizard is a {{wp|dragon|draconic}}, bipedal {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. It is primarily orange with a cream underside from the chest to the tip of its tail. It has a long neck, small blue eyes, slightly raised nostrils, and two horn-like structures protruding from the back of its rectangular head. Two fangs are visible in its upper jaw when its mouth is closed. Two large wings with blue-green undersides sprout from its back, and a horn-like appendage juts out from the top of the third joint of each wing. A single wing finger is visible through the center of each wing membrane. Charizard's arms are short and skinny compared to its robust belly, and each limb has three white claws. In [[Pokémon Red and Green]], Charizard is seemingly shown holding a fireball, implying that it's capable of manipulating its flames using its hands; this is seen in media where it uses [[Fire Punch]]. It has stocky legs with cream-colored soles on each of its {{wp|plantigrade}} feet. The tip of its long, tapering tail burns with a sizable flame, which can intensify to a blue flame if Charizard is irritated. 

Charizard typically inhabits {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Mountain Pokémon|mountains and valleys}}, such as the [[Charicific Valley]] in [[Johto]]. However, Charizard can also live in volcanoes, forming packs with other members of its family, including {{p|Charmander}}. In [[Pokémon Snap]], it's shown that Charizard are fully capable of living inside lava within volcanic craters. 

Charizard flies in search of powerful opponents to battle, and its fire will burn hotter as it gains experience. Its fiery breath can melt boulders and massive glaciers and has been known to cause forest fires accidentally. Though its fiery breath is hot, it never turns it on any opponent weaker than itself. The {{aniseries|GS}} episode ''[[EP134|Charizard's Burning Ambitions]]'' showed that only a weak Charizard would show off its power. The side story episode ''[[HS17|Those Darn Electabuzz!]]'' showed that Charizard can swim underwater, with [[Pokémon Origins]] further showing that the flame on the tip of the tail can still keep burning underwater. Charizard's wings can carry it to an altitude of 4,600 feet (1,400 meters), but [[An Illustrated Book of POCKET MONSTERS]] notes that its droppings were found on {{wp|Mt. Fuji}}, implying it could fly thrice as high. In [[Pokémon Sleep]], as well as media like the {{pkmn|animated series}}, Charizard is known to sleep in an incredibly relaxed position, <ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref> as it is very confident in its power. It has three different sleep styles: ''Stomach Sleep'' (also used for ''Atop-Belly Sleep''), ''Tummy-Rub Sleep'', and ''Tummy-Up Sleep'' - the last of which has Charizard sleeping flat on its back, which may be an indicator of that Charizard being especially strong. In the animated series, it was shown that Charizard may be vulnerable to their tail flame going out in the same way as {{p|Charmander}}, according to the {{aniseries|OS}} episode ''[[EP105|Charizard Chills]]'', where Ash warns his Charizard to not let its flame go out.

Even though Charizard originally couldn't learn the move {{m|Fly}}, Trainers have been shown riding Charizard in official artwork dating back to the 1997 [[Bandai Pokémon Carddass Cards|Carddass Trading Cards]]. {{Ash}} himself was shown riding his Charizard already in the [[S02|second season]] of the [[original series]] of ''Pokémon the Series''. Eventually, in {{game|Yellow}}, Charizard became able to learn Fly and has since been frequently depicted as a Pokémon able to carry people on its back to fly them to distant areas. In [[Alola]], Charizard is a [[Poké Ride|Ride Pokémon]] called Charizard Glide, being used by the natives to fly around the region or make deliveries.

===Forms===
[[File:Mega Charizard X Mega Charizard Y artwork.png|left|thumb|250px|Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y.]]
Charizard has three alternate forms: Mega Charizard X, Mega Charizard Y, and [[Gigantamax]] Charizard. 

Both of Charizard's [[Mega Evolution]]s feature a shorter snout, white, vertical slit pupils, and a bright underside reaching the lower jaw.

;Mega Charizard X
As Mega Charizard X, its body and legs are more physically fit, though its arms remain thin. Its skin turns black with a sky-blue underside and soles. Two spikes with blue tips curve upward from the front and back of each shoulder, while the tips of its horns sharpen, turn blue, and curve slightly upward. Its brow and claws are larger, and its eyes are now red. It has two small, fin-like spikes under each horn and two more down its lower neck. The finger disappears from the wing membrane, and the lower edges are divided into large, rounded points. The third joint of each wing-arm is adorned with a claw-like spike. Mega Charizard X breathes blue flames out the sides of its mouth, and the flame on its tail now burns blue consistently. It is said that its new power turns it black and creates more intense flames. Mega Charizard X's {{a|Tough Claws|claw strength}} has also increased from its original form.

;Mega Charizard Y
As Mega Charizard Y, it becomes sleeker in appearance but retains its normal coloration. It has three pointed horns on the back of its head, the middle of which is longer. Its snout has larger fangs and a ridge on the nose. Its neck is shorter, but its torso is thinner and longer. It features longer {{wp|digitigrade}} feet. Its hands are less developed, with extremely shortened fingers that are no longer separated from each other. Small wings develop on its wrists, while the ones on its back become larger, lose the wing finger passing through their membrane and end up with ragged edges. The back of its tail has a large spike at the base and three smaller ones near the tip, which now burns with a longer flame. Mega Charizard Y is said to have incredible flying prowess that is greater than that of a jet fighter.

;Gigantamax
[[File:Leon Charizard G-Max Wildfire.png|thumb|left|220px|Gigantamax Charizard's wingless body]]
As Gigantamax Charizard, it becomes larger and more physically fit. The lower part of its body glows white, with several yellow diamonds on the lower belly. There are also diamond-shaped spots located on the front legs. The claws located on its hands and feet become longer and sharper. The feet become longer and digitigrade, retaining small glowing soles under the forefeet. The sclerae of the eyes become yellow. The glow of a flame can be seen in the mouth, and the teeth grow, with the lower front teeth and three teeth in the middle now protruding when the mouth is closed. The flame on the tail extends out and has three red clouds surrounding it, like the clouds most other Gigantamax Pokémon have. Two flames sprout from its horns, and its wings are transformed into literal flame wings extending to the shoulder blade.

Due to being enhanced by Gigantamax energy, the fire within Charizard's body has become much stronger, burning hotter than 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit (2,000 degrees Celsius) and continuing to rise in temperature when Gigantamax Charizard roars. When using its [[Signature move|signature]] [[G-Max Move]], {{m|G-Max Wildfire}}, it launches its colossal fiery wings in the shape of a bird, which circles opponents while continuously scorching them with flames even hotter than magma.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon-galar-region/gigantamax-charizard/ Gigantamax Charizard | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref>

Monckton, was inspired to name the species after Charizard thanks to its mountainous habitat and the orange coloration found in the first specimen he observed.<ref name="Real-life taxonomic influence">[http://zookeys.pensoft.net/articles.php?id=7731 A revision of ''Chilicola'' (''Heteroediscelis''), a subgenus of xeromelissine bees (Hymenoptera, Colletidae) endemic to Chile: taxonomy, phylogeny, and biogeography, with descriptions of eight new species]</ref><ref>(June 1, 2016). "[https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/844107 One of 8 new endemic polyester bees from Chile bears the name of a draconic Pokemon]." ''EurekAlert!''. Pensoft Publishers.</ref>

===Concept and development===
Charizard, its pre-evolved forms, and Mega Charizard X were designed by [[Atsuko Nishida]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19980121112202fw_/http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/POKEMON/INTER/ATSUKO/INTER_AT.HTM Interview with Atsuko Nishida on Game Freak's website] (archived, Japanese)</ref><ref>[https://funs-project.com/poplab/007/index_2.html Fun's Project interview with Atsuko Nishida] (Japanese)</ref>

===Origin===
Charizard may be based on {{wp|European dragon}}s, which are heavily associated with the element of fire in {{wp|European folklore}}; this draconic appearance would later be reflected in the {{2t|Fire|Dragon}} typing of Mega Charizard X. Like its pre-evolved forms, it may also take inspiration from lizards, dinosaurs, and the mythical {{wp|Salamanders in folklore|salamander}}. Its English and Japanese nomenclature may be a reference to how Western dragons are heavily inspired by lizards and other reptiles.

====Name origin====
Charizard may be a combination of ''char'' (to burn) and ''lizard''.

Lizardon may be a combination of ''lizard'' and either ''dragon'' or ''-don'' (common suffix in dinosaur names derived from the Ancient Greek word for tooth).
