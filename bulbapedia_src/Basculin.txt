'''Basculin''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''バスラオ''' ''Bassrao'') is a {{type|Water}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation V]].

Basculin has three [[#Form data|different forms]]: '''Red-Striped Form''', '''Blue-Striped Form''', both introduced in {{game|Black and White|s}}; and '''White-Striped Form''', introduced in {{g|Legends: Arceus}} (which is sometimes considered a [[Hisuian form]]).

Red- and Blue-Striped Basculin are not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

White-Striped Basculin evolves into {{p|Basculegion}} when [[level]]ed up after losing at least 294 [[HP]] from [[Recoil|recoil damage]] without fainting.

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for these details.)

==Biology==
Basculin is a green aquatic {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that comes in three forms. The bodies of both the Red- and Blue-Striped Forms are the same. They have a green, ovoid body, tapering off in the rear to a trapezoidal tail fin. A thick black stripe covers the top of their body from mouth to tail and a white, dorsal fin with four protrusions resembling spikes. Their lower jaw juts ahead of their upper jaw, with a small indent near the edges of their mouth. Both forms have three black dots on both sides of their body, behind their pectoral fins.

The main difference between the three forms of Basculin is the color of the stripe that separates the black and green on their body. All forms of Basculin have fins in the same places, with one on top of their body ahead of the tail fin, one below the body ahead of the tail fin, and two side fins. The Red-Striped Form has jagged fins that resemble tridents, whereas the Blue-Striped Form has smooth fins all around. The Red-Striped Form has circular, red eyes, while the Blue-Striped Form has narrower, blue eyes.

Red- and Blue-Striped Basculin are extremely hostile, especially towards their opposite form. They generally start fighting each other on sight for territory. However, on rare occasions, one form may swim with the other's school. Basculin is full of vitality and reproduces quickly. When a school of Basculin appears in a lake, Pokémon other than {{p|Corphish}} and {{p|Crawdaunt}} flee. It competes with {{p|Carvanha}} for food.

Basculin has often been referred to as "the thug of the lake" or "Thug of the River", and uses its jaws, which are strong enough to leave bite marks in iron sheets, to devour everything in its way. However, despite their fierce reputation, Basculin become prey to stronger organisms, such as {{p|Bombirdier}} and {{p|Dondozo}}. Basculin were once also {{DL|Pokémon predation|Humans eating Pokémon|consumed by humans}}, and were considered very delicious. The meat of Blue-Striped Basculin has an inoffensive, light flavor, while the meat of Red-Striped Basculin is fattier, and was more popular with the youth. Basculin is a popular Pokémon with anglers due to its resistance. Many people release Basculin into lakes illegally, causing its population to grow abundant.

===Forms===
Basculin has three separate forms: Red-Striped Form, Blue-Striped Form, and White-Striped Form, the last of which is sometimes considered a [[regional form]].

In [[Hisui]], White-Striped Basculin has a similar appearance to the other two forms of Basculin. Despite its descriptor, the stripes above its eyes are actually a very pale shade of light blue, as are its irises. Its pectoral fins are smooth like Blue-Striped Basculin, but larger. Its dorsal fins are spiky and it has wide eyes, like Red-Striped Basculin. Its lower jaw is smaller than the jaws of either Red- or Blue-Striped Basculin, and both its lower and upper jaws have beak-like protrusions at the front.

Unlike the other two forms, White-Striped Basculin are known to be gentle, with an ecology different enough from other Basculin to spawn recent theories of it being a separate species. White-Striped Basculin are known to share food with each other unlike their two counterparts. They are known to travel upstream; the journey is often perilous for the species, and many of them don't survive. As a result, the souls of the deceased White-Striped Basculin are often left behind in the waters of Hisui. However, when an injured White-Striped Basculin survives, it can unite with the souls in order to achieve the unique [[Evolution]] into {{p|Basculegion}}. In the present day, it's only known to be found in [[Kitakami]]'s [[Timeless Woods]] along with its evolved form.

===Form data===
Basculin has three non-interchangeable forms: Red-Striped Form, Blue-Striped Form, and White-Striped Form. White-Striped Basculin is also considered to be a [[Hisuian form]] in some contexts (such as {{g|HOME}} and its {{g|Legends: Arceus}} Pokédex entry).

Basculin cannot change its form. Generally, Red-Striped Form and Blue-Striped Form are either available in opposite games, or one can be found commonly while the other is rarer or only found through specific methods. For example, in {{game|Black and White|s|Pokémon Black}}, Red-Striped Basculin can frequently be encountered while {{m|surf}}ing or [[fishing]], but Blue-Striped Basculin can only be found in {{DL|Phenomenon|rippling water}}; and in {{game|Black and White|s|Pokémon White}}, the opposite is true. By contrast, in {{g|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon}}, Red-Striped Basculin is exclusive to Ultra Sun and Blue-Striped Basculin is exclusive to Ultra Moon. White-Striped Form is only available in [[Hisui]] ({{g|Legends: Arceus}}) and [[Kitakami]] ({{g|Scarlet and Violet}}: [[The Teal Mask]]).

[[Pokémon breeding|Bred]] Basculin are the same form as their mother, or the same form as the Basculin parent if bred with {{p|Ditto}}. This includes White-Striped Basculin (who is not treated as a regional form for breeding, which would require it to hold an [[Everstone]] to pass down its form). If {{p|Basculegion}} is the mother or is bred with Ditto, the offspring will be White-Striped Basculin. 

====Red-Striped Form====
Only Red-Striped Basculin can have the Ability {{a|Reckless}} and may hold a [[Deep Sea Tooth]] when encountered in the wild.

|}

====Blue-Striped Form====
Only Blue-Striped Basculin can have the Ability {{a|Rock Head}} and may hold a [[Deep Sea Scale]] when encountered in the wild.
{| style="margin: auto"
| {{Compare|name=Basculin|forme=Blue-Striped Form|type=Water|image=0550Basculin-Blue|ab=Rock Head|ab2=Adaptability|abd=Mold Breaker<!--|abo=Reckless-->|HP=70|Attack=92|Defense=65|SpAtk=80|SpDef=55|Speed=98}}
|}
Blue-Striped Basculin initially had access to another set of Abilities in {{game|Black and White|s}}, which is the same as Red-Striped Basculin's (having Reckless instead of Rock Head). However, a Blue-Striped Basculin available in an [[in-game trade]] in Pokémon White has the Ability Rock Head.

Starting with {{B2W2}}, Blue-Striped Basculin's first Ability was changed to Rock Head. (The Black and White-contemporary [[Pokédex 3D]] also shows Blue-Striped Basculin as having access to Reckless, while the subsequent [[Pokédex 3D Pro]] shows it as having access to Rock Head.) If a Blue-Striped Basculin with Reckless is [[transfer]]red from [[Generation V]] to {{g|Bank}}, its Ability is changed to Rock Head.

====White-Striped Form====
Only White-Striped Basculin can have the Ability {{a|Rattled}}. They also learn {{m|Uproar}} at level 40 instead of {{m|Final Gambit}} like the other forms and can evolve into {{p|Basculegion}}.

===Evolution data===
Only White-Striped Basculin can [[Evolution|evolve]].

====White-Striped Form====
White-Striped Basculin evolves into {{p|Basculegion}} when leveled up after losing at least 294 [[HP]] from [[Recoil|recoil damage]]. This can be spread across multiple battles and is not affected by the use of recovery items. [[Fainting]] will reset progress. 

In {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, White-Striped Basculin does not need to level up after losing at least 294 HP from recoil damage in order to evolve.

===Main series===
====Major appearances====
Two forms of Basculin debuted in ''[[BW037|A Fishing Connoisseur in a Fishy Competition!]]''. {{an|Cilan}} managed to capture a Blue-Striped one during a fake [[fishing]] competition set up by {{TRT}}, but a {{pkmn2|wild}} {{p|Frillish}} {{pkmn2|released}} it later. A Red-Striped and a Blue-Striped one were seen being reeled in by two {{pkmn|Trainer}}s. {{an|Iris}} managed to fish another Blue-Striped one with her bare hands but was penalized for it.

A Red-Striped Basculin appeared in [[PK22]], where it played a major role.

==Trivia==
* Red- and Blue-Striped Basculin share their {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Zweilous}}. They are both known as the Hostile Pokémon.
* Basculin's Pokédex entries in {{B2W2|Pokémon Black 2, White 2}}, {{pkmn|X and Y|X}}, {{pkmn|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|Omega Ruby}}, {{pkmn|Sword and Shield|Sword, and Shield}} describe the way they taste, one of the rare instances that hint at [[Pokémon predation#Humans eating Pokémon|Pokémon being used for food by humans]].
* In [[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet]], having Red- or Blue-Striped Basculin registered in the Paldea Pokédex will not register the White-Striped form in the Kitakami Pokédex and vice versa.
* Prior to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet v2.0.1, Basculin had a [[catch rate]] of 25.
** Basculin is the first Pokémon whose catch rate was adjusted via a {{DL|Pokémon Scarlet and Violet|Version history|patch}} to the game.
* If considered a regional form, White-Striped Basculin would be the only regional form to have exactly the same [[type]] as its original form.

===Regional form status===
The status of Basculin's White-Striped Form as a [[regional form]] is inconsistent between various [[Pokémon]] media.

====Evidence for====
* In {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, [[Professor Laventon]] refers to White-Striped Basculin as a regional form in its [[Pokédex entry]].
* White-Striped Basculin is treated as a [[Hisuian form]] when filtering by form in the Pokédex in {{g|HOME}}.
* In the [[Pokémon Trading Card Game]], [[Basculin (TCG)|Basculin cards]] featuring the White-Striped Form use the name "Hisuian Basculin".
* In the video "One Thousand Pokémon!", which was made to commemorate the number of Pokémon in the National Pokédex surpassing 1000, the segment showcasing the Pokémon of Hisui shows White-Striped Basculin alongside Hisuian forms.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa08Y-fhfTI&t=259 "One Thousand Pokémon]." [https://www.youtube.com/c/pokemon The Official Pokémon YouTube Channel]. ''YouTube''.</ref>

====Evidence against====
* White-Striped Basculin is not referred to as "Hisuian Basculin" or "Hisuian form" in the games, instead being referred to as "White-Striped Form".
* In {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, White-Striped Basculin is not treated as a regional form when {{pkmn|breeding}}, as a White-Striped Basculin or {{p|Basculegion}} parent is not required to hold an [[Everstone]] for the offspring to hatch into White-Striped Basculin.
* In the Pokémon Guidebook in the mobile version of Pokémon HOME, regional forms (and Bloodmoon {{p|Ursaluna}}) are listed separately from their original forms, but White-Striped Basculin is not listed separately from Basculin. It also does not appear when filtering for Hisuian forms, despite appearing when doing so in the Pokédex.
* In [[Pokémon GO]], White-Striped Basculin do not appear when [[Pokémon Box (GO)#Search queries|searching]] "hisui", unlike other Hisuian forms.
* White-Striped Basculin and its {{p|Basculegion|evolved form}} are found in the {{pkmn2|wild}} in [[Kitakami]]; conversely, all other regional forms and regional Evolutions are only naturally present in their home region (excluding [[Blueberry Academy]]'s artificial [[Terarium]]).

===Origin===
Basculin is based on a {{wp|bass (fish)|bass}},<ref name=ND205>''Nintendo Dream'' Vol. 205, May 2011 ([http://lavacutcontent.com/ken-sugimori-nintendo-dream/ Translation by Dr. Lava])</ref> most likely the {{wp|largemouth bass}} or the {{wp|peacock bass}} due to their greenish color, pattern of horizontal splotches, and vigorous resistance when being fished. It is likely also inspired by the {{wp|piranha}}, which has historically been viewed as violent. Its Red-Striped and Blue-Striped variations that are hostile to each other are similar to {{wp|Siamese fighting fish}}, which come in a variety of colors (including red and blue) and are extremely aggressive and territorial to others. It could also be compared to street gangs, where groups of affiliated people often fight rival groups over their own territory.

According to interviews with [[Ken Sugimori]] in ''Nintendo Dream'' Vol. 205, Basculin was created late in development when it was realized that there were few new fish-like Pokémon in [[Unova]]. It was given two forms to make up for this, and it was also based on a bass since there are wild bass in {{wp|New York (state)|New York}}, which Unova is based on.<ref name="ND205"/>

While Basculin's White-Striped Form may likewise be inspired by a bass, its design is also reminiscent of the {{wp|salmon}} or the related itou ({{wp|Sakhalin taimen}}), due to its behavior and the shape of its mouth resembling the {{wp|kype}}s that develop in male salmon. Its [[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet|Pokémon Violet]] Pokédex entry suggesting that it may be a different species to Red- and Blue-Striped Basculin may be a reference to this.

The selection of colored forms being red, white, and blue may reference the national {{wp|flag of the United States}}, as Unova, the region Basculin was first introduced in, is based on New York.

====Name origin====
Basculin may be a combination of ''bass'' and ''masculine''.

Bassrao may be a combination of ''bass'' and 丈夫 ''masurao'' (warrior, referring to its {{a|Reckless|bold, violent nature}}) or バカラオ ''bakarao'' ({{wp|bacalhau}}).
