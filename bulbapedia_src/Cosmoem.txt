'''Cosmoem''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''コスモウム''' ''Cosmovum'') is a {{type|Psychic}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation VII]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Cosmog}} starting at [[level]] 43 and evolves into either {{p|Solgaleo}} or {{p|Lunala}} starting at level 53 depending on the game it evolves in.
* In {{pkmn|Sun and Moon|Pokémon Sun}}, {{pkmn|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|Ultra Sun}}, {{pkmn|Sword and Shield|Sword}}, and {{pkmn|Scarlet and Violet|Scarlet}}, it evolves into Solgaleo. 
* In {{pkmn|Sun and Moon|Pokémon Moon}}, {{pkmn|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|Ultra Moon}}, {{pkmn|Sword and Shield|Shield}}, and {{pkmn|Scarlet and Violet|Violet}}, it evolves into Lunala.

==Biology==
[[File:Cosmoem SM concept art.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Concept artwork of Cosmoem for {{g|Sun and Moon}}]]
Cosmoem is a {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} in the shape of a translucent, dark-blue orb with a starscape pattern set in a golden shell-like structure. The main portion of the shell is a flat oval around the center of the orb. Eight more flat, half-oval projections surround the orb in an asterisk-shape. At the center of the main body is a much smaller black core. The upper half of the core has a thin blue line on the front, back, and each side, while the lower has pink lines. On the front are two orange semicircles, which appear to be closed eyes. The overall shape of this Pokémon also resembles an eye. When evolving, the Pokémon glows either an orange or a purple color, correlating to {{p|Solgaleo}} and {{p|Lunala}}, respectively, gaining traits of either a stylized sun or a stylized moon.

Encased in its sturdy, cocoon-like shell, Cosmoem is unable to move. In [[Pokémon Refresh]], it cannot even eat. It grows as it absorbs starlight and the dust in the air. Its body is warm to the touch. Cosmoem's shell is said to be harder than any known material. In ancient times, it was known as the "cocoon of the stars" by the people of [[Alola]].

Cosmoem is one of the [[List of Pokémon by height|shortest Pokémon]] in existence. Despite this, it is also the [[List of Pokémon by weight|heaviest Pokémon]] in existence, being tied with {{p|Celesteela}}. Cosmoem's height in the Pokédex is actually measured by its width, rather than its height, as seen in its concept art.

==Trivia==
<!--Do not add trivia about Cosmoem's density. It is pure speculation, even if it has a set height and mass, we do not know its VOLUME.-->
* In {{g|Sun and Moon}}, Cosmoem has a base [[experience]] yield of 80.
* Cosmoem is the [[List of Pokémon by height|smallest]] and [[List of Pokémon by weight|heaviest]] of all {{type|Psychic}} Pokémon.
** Cosmoem is also the smallest of all Legendary Pokémon, and tied with {{p|Celesteela}} for the heaviest of all Pokémon.
** With its pre-evolved form weighing in at 0.1&nbsp;kg (0.2&nbsp;lbs.) and Cosmoem at 999.9&nbsp;kg (2204.4&nbsp;lbs.), the [[Evolution]] from {{p|Cosmog}} to Cosmoem is the largest increase in weight due to Evolution, with an increase of 999,800%.<!--Note: using rounded imperial values would give a greater change, but the imperial weight value is rounded to one decimal place.-->
** Cosmoem also loses the most weight out of any Pokémon upon Evolution when it evolves into Lunala (120.0 kg at (264.6 lbs.)), who weighs 879.9 kilograms less than Cosmoem.
** Even though Cosmoem is one of the heaviest Pokémon, [[Lillie]] carries [[Nebby|a Cosmoem]] in her bag, and [[Ash Ketchum|Ash]] manages to hold Cosmoem's weight in the [[series]].
* In games prior to {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, Cosmoem has a catch rate of 45.
* Cosmoem, Cosmog, and {{p|Type: Null}} were the first instances of {{pkmn2|Legendary}} Pokémon able to [[evolve]], with all three debuting in {{g|Sun and Moon}}.
* Cosmog and Cosmoem are the only Pokémon to be unobtainable without [[transfer]] in a game in which their evolved forms ({{p|Solgaleo}} and {{p|Lunala}}) are obtainable, that being Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
* Cosmoem's Evolution from Cosmog has the greatest {{wp|standard deviation}} of all Pokémon, with 47.14, meaning that the changes to its [[base stats]] on evolving are the most uneven out of all Pokémon.
* Cosmoem has the highest {{stat|Special Defense}} of all Pokémon that can still evolve.
* Cosmoem has the fewest learnable [[move]]s out of all evolved Pokémon, with only three moves that it can learn.
* Cosmoem and its pre-evolved form, Cosmog, are the only Pokémon who are unable to damage an opponent outside of {{m|Struggle}}.

===Origin===
Cosmoem has characteristics of both a stylized sun and a stylized moon, having rays and a pair of crescents, respectively. Its enormous weight despite its extremely small size shares similarities with super-compressed astronomical bodies such as {{wp|black holes}} and {{wp|neutron stars}}. Given its description, it seems to be an embodiment of star formation in general. It may also be based on the idea of the {{wp|world egg}}. When viewed from the front, its shape resembles an eye.

====Name origin====
Cosmoem may be a combination of ''{{wp|cosmos}}'', ''ovum'' (Latin for egg), and ''{{wp|embryo}}''.

Cosmovum may be a combination of ''cosmos'' and ''ovum''.
