'''Smeargle''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ドーブル''' ''Doble'') is a {{type|Normal}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation II]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

Smeargle is best known for its [[signature move]] {{m|Sketch}}, which permanently copies the last move used by the opponent (with a few exceptions), thus allowing Smeargle to learn almost any move.

==Biology==
[[File:Jack Pollockson Smeargle.png|thumb|left|220px|Smeargle with various tail colors]]
[[File:Sugimori Smeargle AG.jpg|thumb|250px|{{aniseries|AG}} reference sheet]]
Smeargle is a bipedal, {{wp|beagle}}-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with white and brown fur. It has a long tail with an end resembling a paintbrush. The tail tip oozes with a mysterious paint-like fluid, and although the color of the paint is predetermined for each individual Smeargle, it may otherwise vary; a Smeargle's paint hue may also change in intensity with its emotional state. Smeargle has a footprint on its back that is typically the same color as the paint on the tip of its tail, though Smeargle can have separate back and tail colors in {{g|Stadium 2}}. The mark is placed on Smeargle's back as a sign of adulthood. Smeargle also has a round structure on its head with a point that resembles a {{wp|beret}}. It has floppy, brown ears and a brown collar on its neck. The rings encircling Smeargle's eyes are also brown, as are Smeargle's eyelids. Its arms have two brown bands, and its legs have only one. Each of its limbs has three digits.

Smeargle's in-game appearances in {{game2|Gold|Silver|Crystal}} as well as [[Pokémon Colosseum]] and [[Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness]] all depict it with red paint on its back and tail while its {{Shiny}} coloration is depicted with green; the inverse is true in the [[Generation III]] [[core series]] games and in every game from [[Generation IV]] onwards. Pokémon Stadium 2 and the ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' episode ''[[EP197|The Art of Pokémon]]'' both depict Smeargle that have blue back and tail colors, with the animated series episode also depicting Smeargle that have yellow back and tail colors. Its Shiny coloration in Stadium 2 can also be seen with teal, orange, or indigo paint on its back and tail.

Smeargle uses its paint to mark its territory. There are over 5,000 known different marks that Smeargle uses, and paintings of certain symbols are highly valued by Smeargle fanatics, who will pay large sums to own them. It can also use its [[signature move]], {{m|Sketch}}, to copy moves from other Pokémon. Smeargle is the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Sketch. Smeargle is often found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Urban Pokémon|urban areas}} filled with graffiti.

<div style="margin:0.5ch; background:#fff; {{roundy|10px}}; padding:1ch;">
* In {{g|GO}}, Smeargle only spawns after photobombing a Pokémon while taking its picture with the AR Camera.
** Outside of special events, there is a 10% chance of a Smeargle photobomb for each session with the AR Camera, up to one photobomb per day. 
* Smeargle will know the same moves as the Pokémon it photobombed, if possible. 
** If the Pokémon knows two Charged Attacks, Smeargle will learn the one in the first slot. 
** If that Pokémon knows a move Smeargle cannot learn, Smeargle will have a random move instead.
* Smeargle cannot learn a second Charged Attack, even if the photobombed Pokémon has one.
* Smeargle cannot use a TM or an Elite TM to change its moves. <!--Smeargle used to be able to re-roll its moves via TM, but this was changed sometime after initial release-->

==Trivia==
* Due to its [[signature move]] {{m|Sketch}}, Smeargle can legitimately know almost any [[move]], giving it a number of distinctions:
** Smeargle can pass down any [[Egg Move]] combination to any {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} in the {{egg3|Field}}. This was important in Generations II to V, when only the father could pass down Egg Moves.
** {{m|Hidden Power}}-evaluating NPCs cannot identify the type of Smeargle's Hidden Power even if Smeargle possesses the move, due to being unable to use the TM for it.
** Prior to [[Generation IX]], Smeargle was able to sketch {{m|Hyperspace Fury}} and {{m|Dark Void}}, but the moves would always fail when used by Pokémon other than {{p|Hoopa}} {{form|Hoopa|Unbound}} (and starting in {{g|Sun and Moon}}), {{p|Darkrai}}, respectively.
* Smeargle is the only Pokémon capable of learning the same move by leveling up more than four times—some Pokémon have the same move available at level 1 as well as by leveling up, while Smeargle has the same move available ten times as it levels up.
* In the [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team]] mission "Smeargle's Desperate Plea", even though the Smeargle refuses to have a paw painted onto its back, the paw print is nonetheless present on its sprite.
* In [[Pokémon Colosseum]] and [[Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness]], the paint on Smeargle's back and tail is red in its normal coloration and green in its shiny coloration, which how it was depicted in the [[Generation II]] [[Core series|core series]] games despite the inverse being the case in the [[Generation III]] core series games at the time of their release.
* In [[Pokémon Stadium 2]], Smeargle can have either red, green or blue back and tail paint colors and its {{Shiny}} coloration can have either teal, indigo or orange back and tail paint colors respectively, determined by a combination of its [[Stat#Speed|Speed]], [[Stat#Defense|Defense]], [[Stat#Special|Special]] and [[Stat#Attack|Attack]] [[Individual values|DVs]].<ref>[https://bluemoonfalls.com/pages/general/stadium-hues#smeargle Stadium's Color Changing Pokémon - Blue Moon Falls]</ref>
** Uniquely, Pokémon Stadium 2 is the only game in which Smeargle is depicted with additional paint colors that aren't tied to its Shiny coloration. It is also the only instance of the paint on Smeargle's back and tail being shown as two separate colors.
* Because it's only ever capable of learning Sketch by level up, and being unable to learn any [[TM]] or [[HM]] move, Smeargle has both the smallest and the largest move pool out of any Pokémon.

===Origin===
Smeargle appears to be based on a {{wp|beagle}} and a {{wp|painter}}. Its tail is used as a {{wp|paintbrush}}, its head looks like it is wearing a {{wp|beret}}, a hat often associated with painters, and it has a {{wp|footprint}} stamped on its back which is a form of art.

====Name origin====
Smeargle may be a combination of ''smear'' and ''beagle''.

Doble may be a combination of ''dog'', ''daub'', and ''doodle''. It may also be derived from ''doble'' (Spanish for double), possibly referring to Smeargle's ability to copy moves.
