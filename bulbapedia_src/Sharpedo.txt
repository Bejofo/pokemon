'''Sharpedo''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''サメハダー''' ''Samehader'') is a dual-type {{2t|Water|Dark}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation III]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s from {{p|Carvanha}} starting at [[level]] 30.

Sharpedo can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Sharpedo''' using the [[Sharpedonite]].

==Biology==
[[File:Sharpedo Jet VII OD.png|200px|thumb|left|Sharpedo Jet]]
Sharpedo is a torpedo-shaped shark {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} covered with tiny, sharp {{wp|denticles}}. It has a large mouth filled with triangular, sharp teeth. Its eyes are a deep red color and glow in the dark. It has two gill slits situated directly behind each eye. It is mostly dark blue with a white underbelly. There is a yellow star-shaped scar on its snout, and another star-shaped scar on its rear. It has a tall {{wp|dorsal fin}} with two notches cut into it, with a {{wp|Fish anatomy#Fins|pelvic fin}} directly opposite it. Its two pectoral fins are arranged so that they resemble the fins on the back of a torpedo.

Sharpedo swallows and shoots out jets of seawater from its rear, which allows it to swim 75 to 80 miles per hour. However, it is unable to swim long distances. It is feared and known by many names as '''Bully of the Sea''', '''Ruffian of the Seas''', '''Bandit of the Sea''', or '''Gangster of the Sea''' as a group, due to its sharp teeth. Sharpedo uses the teeth to finish off its opponent. It was once prized for its dorsal fin as a food item and has been a victim of overfishing. Its fangs can easily rip through steel, being able to tear apart a supertanker into pieces. Sharpedo's fangs can instantly grow back the moment they fall out. Discarded Sharpedo fangs are made into accessories due to the belief they can prevent ship mishaps. It also indiscriminately attacks any ships that enter the waters it resides in. It is very sensitive to the scent of blood. It lives in the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Sea Pokémon|sea.}} Sharpedo is known to prey on {{p|Wailmer}}, particularly small ones. It also preys on other {{type|Water}} Pokémon such as {{p|Finneon}}, {{p|Lumineon}}, {{p|Lanturn}}, and {{p|Squirtle}}. In [[Alola]], Sharpedo is used as [[Poké Ride|Ride Pokémon]] called Sharpedo Jet, the natives use Sharpedo to move faster in the water and destroy rocks in the water.

Prior to [[Generation V]], Sharpedo and its pre-evolved form, {{p|Carvanha}}, were the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that could have {{a|Rough Skin}} as an [[Ability]].

===Forms===
Sharpedo can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Sharpedo.

As Mega Sharpedo the fangs in its mouth have transformed, and the horns that have sprouted from its nose are fangs that are retractable and can be regrown countless times. The yellow patterns on its body are old resurfaced scars that were carved in battle, causing it sharp pain and suffering. With explosive propulsion, it can exceed 125 mph in an instant.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150207095009/http://www.pokemonrubysapphire.com/en-us/pokemon/new-mega-evolutions/mega-sharpedo Mega Sharpedo]</ref> Its combat instincts were increased due to Mega Evolution. Mega Sharpedo's sharp spikes can cause deep wounds to its opponents after charging at them.

==Trivia==
* In {{pkmn|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, if a {{player}} {{m|surf}}s on a Sharpedo, it will have its own model, and it can surf twice as fast as other Pokémon. However, it is impossible to fish while surfing on a Sharpedo, with the game stating, "It's too risky to let go now!" An NPC on {{rt|124|Hoenn}} refers to this as "speed surfing" if the player admits ignorance to their question.
* Due to [[List of censored words in Generation V|the censor]] that prevents Pokémon with offensive [[nickname]]s from being traded on the [[GTS]], an English-language Sharpedo could not be traded on the GTS without a nickname in {{game|Black and White|s}}.
* Sharpedo shares its {{pkmn|category}} name with {{p|Hydreigon}}. They are both known as the Brutal Pokémon.
* In the [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire demo]] shown at Pokémon Festa 2002 in Japan, players started with a level 12 Sharpedo with no Ability. This was most likely done for the purpose of the demo only.
* Sharpedo's evolutionary line may be considered a counterpart of {{p|Camerupt}}'s evolutionary line. Both of them are dual-type Pokémon, both lines have identical base stat totals per evolutionary stage, both of their final Evolutions are used by [[Team Aqua]] Leader [[Archie]] and [[Team Magma]] Leader [[Maxie]], respectively, and both of their final Evolutions can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]].

===Origin===
Sharpedo appears to be based on a {{wp|shark}}, likely the {{wp|great white shark}}, but without the rear half of its body. This body shape makes it similar to an {{wp|ocean sunfish}}; both sharks and sunfish are known for their sandpaper-like skin. Sharpedo's body shape also resembles a {{wp|torpedo}}. The star on its head may allude to sharks like {{wp|starspotted smooth-hound}} or {{wp|starry smooth-hound}}. Sharpedo's Pokédex entry in [[Pokémon Sun and Moon|Pokémon Moon]] stating that it became a victim of overfishing due to its dorsal fin being a treasured foodstuff is likely a reference to {{wp|shark finning}}, where wild sharks are caught and have their fins cut off, and the shark is then thrown back in the water to die; because of this practice, many species of sharks around the world are listed as threatened or endangered by the {{wp|International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN}}.

Mega Sharpedo seems to be based on a {{wp|sawshark}} or {{wp|sawfish}}. Its body shape resembles a {{wp|motorboat}}.

====Name origin====
Sharpedo may be a combination of ''shark'', ''sharp'', and ''torpedo''.

Samehader may be derived from 鮫肌 ''samehada'' (rough skin, literally ''shark skin''), possibly referring to its {{a|Rough Skin}} Ability.
