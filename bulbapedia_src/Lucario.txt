'''Lucario''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ルカリオ''' ''Lucario'') is a dual-type {{2t|Fighting|Steel}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation IV]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Riolu}} when [[friendship Evolution|leveled up with high friendship]] during the [[Time-based Evolution|day]].

Lucario can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Lucario''' using the [[Lucarionite]].

==Biology==
[[File:Ash Lucario Aura vision.png|thumb|left|250px|Lucario using its [[aura]] vision to sense aura.]]
[[File:Korrina Mega Lucario Bone Rush.png|thumb|250px|Mega Lucario creating a {{m|Bone Rush|bone staff}}]]
Lucario is a bipedal, canine-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with predominantly blue and black fur. It possesses a short, round spike on the back of each forepaw, in addition to a third on its chest. It has red eyes, a long snout, and ears. When its mouth is open, two pairs of pointed teeth, one in the upper jaw and one in the lower, can be seen. It possesses cream-colored fur on its torso and blue fur on its thighs that resemble shorts. It has a medium-length tail of the same blue color as well. [[wp:Digitigrade|It stands on its toes rather than on its entire foot.]] It has developed four black appendages that hang down from its head, which rise when Lucario reads or manipulates [[aura]], a special energy that it senses; these appendages are very similar in shape and number to the four pink appendages on the head of the Being of Emotion, {{p|Mesprit}}. Lucario can use its powers to create a staff in the form of a bone and use it to fight.

Lucario can study auras to predict the movements of its opponents and track their quarry. With sufficient training, a Lucario can read auras to understand how living beings are feeling from more than half a mile (1 kilometer) away. However, Lucario sometimes ends up learning information that it would not like to know, causing it to get stressed out easily. It also has the power to manipulate this energy in an offensive manner, in the form of {{m|Aura Sphere|explosive spheres of energy}}. Lucario can understand human speech and has been reported to communicate with humans through telepathy.

Lucario is considered to be prideful and is extremely loyal to its {{pkmn|Trainer}}. It also seems to have a natural sense of justice, as it only trusts Trainers with righteous hearts. It is an exceptionally rare Pokémon that usually lives deep in mountains very far from people to improve their skills. Lucario are primarily carnivores, hunting their prey in packs, though one {{OBP|Lucario|M08}} was seen eating {{Berries}} and plants like roses. It has also been seen eating chocolate, although chocolate is not part of its natural diet. As mentioned in the [[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]], Lucario never lowers its guard, even when sleeping. It is believed Lucario reads the aura of others while asleep similarly to when it is awake.

===Forms===
Lucario can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Lucario.

As Mega Lucario, its cream fur becomes longer, and its thighs slim down. Mega Lucario's arms appear more muscular and it develops more spikes on the back of its paws, which have turned crimson. It also develops spikes on both of its feet, which have become crimson too. Its previously red eyes are now orange-colored. Its aura-sensing appendages grow longer, and two of them are tipped in crimson. Its shoulders also possess a spike each. Its aura heightens throughout its body, which formed black markings on its blue fur.<ref>http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/pokemon/mega_pokemon/#Lucario</ref>

In [[Kalos]], Mega Lucario is believed to be the first discovered Mega Evolution, until the discovery of Mega {{p|Rayquaza}} in [[Hoenn]]. It was the first recorded Mega Evolution to be achieved by [[Mega Stone]]. Mega Lucario's fighting style has been described as heartless due to it being bathed in the explosive energy of Mega Evolution, awakening its combative instincts and causing it to attack mercilessly against its opponents.

===Origin===
Lucario's appearance is akin to that of an anthropomorphic {{wp|Canidae|canid}} of no discernable kind.

The markings on Lucario's face resemble a {{wp|muzzle (mouth guard)|muzzle}} or mask. The four appendages on Lucario's head, together with the shape drawn by its mask (a bisected ring), may suggest inspiration from a {{wp|khakkhara}}, which in popular depictions can respond to spiritual energies similarly to how Lucario's appendages act when it senses aura.

The concept of [[aura]] associated with Lucario seems to closely resemble vital energies such as {{wp|qi}} or {{wp|chakra}}. Lucario's {{t|Fighting}} type likely comes from the fact qi is conceptually present in {{wp|Qi#Martial_arts|many West Asian martial arts}} as {{wp|neijin}} or similar ideas. Lucario's use of a staff may hint at a {{wp|bōjutsu}} practitioner, while the shorts-like fur on its legs may reference the clothing used in {{wp|boxing}}, {{wp|Muay Thai}}, or {{wp|mixed martial art}}s.

Due to its mystical nature, it may be based on animalistic-humanoid portrayal of the Egyptian god {{wp|Anubis}} (speculated to be a {{wp|Canis aureus|Golden jackal}} or {{wp|Canis lupaster lupaster|African wolf}}). Anubis's role in {{wp|Egyptian mythology}} was to judge souls based on their purity, which resembles Lucario's ability to see a life form's aura. Lucario using a {{m|Bone Rush|bone staff}} in combat may also reference the {{wp|Was-sceptre|''Was''-sceptre}} often seen in depictions of Anubis.

Considering the possible connection with ancient Egypt through Anubis, Lucario could also be based on an {{wp|Boxing#Ancient_history|Ancient Egypt boxer}}, given that boxing as a sport was recorded at its earliest in the {{wp|Nubia}} region of {{wp|Egypt}}, as well as {{wp|Sumer}}.

====Name origin====
Lucario may be derived from the reverse of the Japanese transcription of ''{{wp|orichalcum}}'' (a mythical metal) or ''{{wp|oracle}}'' (referring to its supernatural abilities involving [[aura]]). It may also involve λύκος ''lúkos'' (Greek for wolf), and possibly ''luchar'' (Spanish for ''to fight'').
