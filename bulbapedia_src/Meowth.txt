'''Meowth''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ニャース ''' ''Nyarth'') is a {{type|Normal}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s into {{p|Persian}} starting at [[level]] 28.

In [[Alola]], Meowth has a {{type|Dark}} [[regional form]]. It evolves into {{rf|Alolan}} Persian when leveled up with high [[friendship]].

In [[Galar]], Meowth has a {{type|Steel}} regional form. It evolves into {{p|Perrserker}} starting at level 28.

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for these details.)

Kantonian Meowth can [[Gigantamax]] into '''Gigantamax Meowth''' if it has the {{DL|Gigantamax|Gigantamax Factor}}. Meowth with the Gigantamax Factor cannot evolve.

==Biology==
[[File:HGSS Meowth quadruped.png|thumb|right|200px|Meowth walking on all fours in the overworld]]
Meowth is a small, {{wp|Felidae|feline}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with cream-colored fur that turns brown at the tips of its hind paws and tail. Its ovoid head features four prominent whiskers, wide eyes with slit pupils, two pointed teeth in the upper jaw, and a gold {{wp|Koban (coin)|koban}} coin embedded in its forehead. Its ears are black with brown interiors and are flanked with an additional pair of long whiskers. Meowth can freely manipulate its claws, retracting them when it wants to move silently. The tip of its tail curls tightly. Meowth is a quadruped with the ability to walk on its hind legs. While the games almost always depict Meowth on two legs, it is stated in the ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' episode ''[[EP070|Go West Young Meowth]]'' that Meowth normally walks on all fours.

Meowth is attracted to round and shiny objects and has the unique ability to produce coins using its [[signature move]], {{m|Pay Day}}. Meowth and its evolved forms are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Pay Day by leveling up. Being nocturnal, it is known to wander about city streets at night and pick up anything that sparkles, including loose change. Upon finding a sparkling object, its eyes will glitter and the coin on its forehead will shine brightly. It shares this intrigue with {{p|Murkrow}}, with whom it often fights with for objects and prey. Meowth is a playful but fickle Pokémon with the capacity for human-like intelligence, with at least {{MTR|one member}} of the species teaching itself how to speak. Meowth tends to live in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Urban Pokémon|urban areas}} to collect the coins that people drop. As mentioned in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Meowth is known to sleep with the coins it collects.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref>

===Forms===
Meowth has a [[Gigantamax]] form and two [[regional form]]s, {{rf|Alolan}} Meowth and {{rf|Galarian}} Meowth.

;Alolan Meowth
In [[Alola]], Meowth has a slightly different look. This look was the result of the monarchy's influence. Alolan Meowth's fur is a light blue-gray color. Instead of brown markings, the tip of its tail, whiskers, digits, and the insides of its ears are a whitish-gray. Alolan Meowth's whiskers have a slight curve compared to regular Meowth's straighter whiskers, and it has silvery eyes.

Meowth was introduced to Alola as a gift to royalty.<ref>[http://www.Pokémon-sunmoon.com/en-us/Pokémon/alolan-meowth/ Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Alolan Meowth]</ref> The luxurious royal lifestyle soon led to Meowth diverging from its origins and becoming the selfish, prideful, and cunning Alolan Meowth. As a result, Alolan Mewoth's new pride also made them impulsive and fickle in nature. Alolan Meowth will turn hysterical if its coin or pride are besmirched. Due to the actions of humans in Alola, Alolan Meowth's population increased in numbers. When the monarchy fell, the rare Alolan Meowth went feral and eventually grew as common in Alola as anywhere else. Alolan Meowth is known to be very famously diffcult to train due to their arrogant nature. Despite this, Alolan Meowth is also very popular with some Trainers who enjoy giving it a lot of attention.

;Galarian Meowth
Galarian Meowth has a shaggy, greyish-brown coat resembling a beard, as well as yellow eyes and a toothy grin. Its coin is now black and extremely hard, with the darkest and hardest coins being especially valued and respected among the species.

Galarian Meowth's body has partially turned to iron as a result of many years of living with a race of savage seafarers. As a result of many battles, Galarian Meowth develops the ability to evolve into {{p|Perrserker}}, instead of {{p|Persian}}. Kantonian Meowth and Galarian Meowth don't get along.

;Gigantamax Meowth
Some Kantonian Meowth are capable of Gigantamaxing. As Gigantamax Meowth, it has become larger and longer in size. The body extends from the lower half to the shoulder, while the gold coin gains a symbol. Meowth's eyes change to a glowing gold color. The tail grows long as well, with the end of its tip extending. The tail gets even larger and bumpy when it uses an attack. Three red clouds surround it below the shoulders.

The giant coin on Gigantamax Meowth's head emits a lot of Gigantamax power that surrounds the area with a golden gleam. Its desire for shiny objects increases to the point where it will cause damage to skyscraper windows and exterior walls for the sake of sharpening its claws.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon-galar-region/gigantamax-meowth/ Gigantamax Meowth | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref> The symbol on Gigantamax Meowth's gold coin is believed to be the key to unlocking the secrets of [[Dynamax]].

Gigantamax Meowth is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of using the [[G-Max Move]] {{m|G-Max Gold Rush}}.

Multiple Meowth can be found during the {{OBP|Beach|Snap}} level. These Meowth are prone to accident and injury, as {{p|Pidgey}} is easily provoked to use {{m|Gust}} on them. Snap can also knock Meowth off a rock, making it fall to the ground.

===[[Super Smash Bros.]]===
Meowth appears as a {{i|Poké Ball}} summon. It attacks opponents with {{m|Pay Day}}.

===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]===

====Trophy information====
''"This... is Meowth's dream. Meowth strides all over the globe, scattering invitations to other Pokémon insisting they come to "Meowth's Party." At this wonderful party, guests are packed in like sardines as Meowth climbs up the stage with its faithful guitar. It strikes a chord, pauses, and then rocks their world!''''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]===
Meowth returns as a Poké Ball summon, attacking opponents with {{m|Pay Day}}. However, it instead faces one direction rather than attacking from all sides.

====Trophy Information====
''"A Scratch Cat Pokémon. It's one of the most famous Pokémon and very fond of things that glitter--the gold medallion on its head could be seen as an indicator of this infatuation. There are many Pokémon that resemble cats, but Meowth is the only one that can use Pay Day to receive coins at the end of battle. It evolves into Persian."''

[[File:Meowth SSB4.png|thumb|left|240px|Meowth in Super Smash Bros. for 3DS]]

Meowth also appears as a trophy in both versions of the game.

====Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''"Meowth is a Normal-type, Scratch Cat Pokémon who absolutely loves anything shiny. It's a creature of the night, and it's not unusual to discover a Meowth and a Murkrow fighting over their finds. Meowth's attack Pay Day can deal a ton of damage if an opponent gets caught in it. How purrfect!"''

'''PAL''': ''"Meowth, a Normal-type Pokémon, loves round, shiny things. It runs around at night, hunting for little treasures and trinkets, but often ends up getting into fights with Murkrow about who'll get to keep them. Watch out for Meowth's Pay Day attack. If it catches you from behind, it can be purralysingly pawerful!"''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Meowth returns as a Poké Ball summon, retaining the same behavior as before. It also appears as a {{sbw|Spirit}}.

==Trivia==
[[File:Niue Dollar Pokémon.png|thumb|$1 coins from {{wp|Niue}}]]
[[File:Meowth Red Battle Chess.png|thumb|Meowth in Pokémon Battle Chess]]
* In ''[[EP070|Go West, Young Meowth]]'', it was stated that {{MTR}} of Team Rocket had to learn and practice standing on his hind legs like a human, implying that Meowth as a species is not naturally able to stand on their hind legs. However, almost all sprites in the {{pkmn|games}} and the [[Pokédex]] in ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' depict it standing on its hind legs, suggesting Meowth has the natural ability to walk on two legs. [[Tyson's Meowth]] is also able to walk on two legs, seemingly naturally.
** The only time Meowth is depicted on all fours in the games is in {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}}; when the player places Meowth as the first Pokémon in their party, Meowth will walk on four legs behind the player.
* Meowth is the first Pokémon in ''Pokémon the Series'' depicted with the ability to {{pkmn2|Talking|talk}}.
* Meowth's number in the [[National Pokédex]] and the [[List of Pokémon by Alola Pokédex number in Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|Alola Pokédex]] in [[Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon]] are the same: 052.
* Meowth is the only Pokémon to have [[regional form]]s for multiple regions.
* Meowth is the only Pokémon to have both a regional form and [[Gigantamax]] form.
* Meowth may be considered a counterpart of {{p|Mankey}}. Both of them are {{cat|Generation I Pokémon}} who evolve into their evolved forms at level 28. Meowth is exclusive to {{game|Red and Blue|s|Pokémon Blue}}, {{game|Gold and Silver|s|Silver}}, {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s|SoulSilver}}, and {{LGPE|Let's Go Eevee!}}; while Mankey is exclusive to Red, Gold, HeartGold, and Let's Go, Pikachu!. Also, in {{B2W2|Black 2 and White 2}}, [[Yancy]] will trade the {{player}} a Meowth if the player is male, and [[Curtis]] will trade Mankey if the player is female. Additionally, both seem to have a similar color scheme.
* Meowth had the Dark-type typing in the TCG set [[POP Series 5]]: {{TCG ID|POP Series 5|Meowth δ|11}}, which debuted a decade before Alolan Meowth would make an appearance in Pokémon Sun & Moon.
* In the original preview for [[HZ066|episode 66]] of {{aniseries|HZ}}, a Kantonian Meowth was supposed to appear alongside one of the students from [[Naranja Academy]]. In the final version of the episode, the respective Pokémon was removed, and up until that point, the last appearance of a Kantonian Meowth within the {{pkmn|animated series}} was [[Team Rocket's Meowth]] in the {{aniseries|JN}} episode ''[[JN147|The Rainbow and the Pokémon Master!]]''.

===Merchandise===
* Meowth appears in {{DL|Pokémon Battle Chess|Pokémon Battle Chess}}. It doesn't behave like any traditional piece in chess.

===Cultural impact===
* {{wp|Niue}} released a one-dollar coin featuring Meowth as part of a commemorative promotion for the [[Pokémon]] franchise, with Meowth on one side and the nation's coat of arms on the other.

===Origin===
{{Bulbanews|On the Origin of Species: Meowth}}
Meowth seems to be based upon the Japanese legend of the 招き猫 ''{{wp|Maneki-neko}}'', also known as the lucky cat or beckoning cat. According to one legend, a cat raised its paw to welcome a lord and saved his life when a lightning bolt hit the spot where he had been standing. ''Maneki-neko'' are often used as charms in restaurants and shops to bring customers fortune and good luck. Statues of the cat are usually depicted holding a ''{{wp|Koban (coin)|koban}}'', an ancient coin used in Japan, like the one on Meowth's head. Meowth's color and pattern suggest that it also draws inspiration from {{wp|Siamese cat}}s. Its Japanese [[Pokémon category]] also suggests it is based on a ''{{wp|Bakeneko}}''.

Unlike the normal Meowth, Alolan Meowth appears to be based more on domestic cats that underwent selective breeding, specifically those owned by royalty. In particular, its appearance resembles the "British Blue" color variant of the {{wp|British Shorthair}}, an imported breed known well for its large and rounded head and pronounced 'smile', which the breed developed through artificial selection as part of the process of developing its pedigree.

Based on its appearance and [[Pokémon Sword and Shield|Sword]] [[Pokédex]] entry, Galarian Meowth may be based on {{wp|Norwegian Forest cat}}s, large fluffy cats with beard-like ruffs, or {{wp|European Wildcat}}s, with traits of the {{wp|Vikings}} that kept the breed's presumed ancestors on their ships.

Gigantamax Meowth's elongated body may be based on a sketch from ''{{wp|Monty Python's Flying Circus}}'' about a giant cat with outstretched arms and the {{wp|longcat}} meme.

====Name origin====
Meowth may be a combination of ''meow'' (the sound a cat makes), ''mouth'', and ''wealth'', alluding to the Maneki-neko's capacity to bring good fortune. The ''-th'' may also be borrowed from Nyarth, as both ''meow'' and ''nyā'' are onomatopoeia of a cat's cry.

Nyarth may be a play on ニャー ''nyā'' (the Japanese {{wp|onomatopoeia}} for the sound a cat makes).
