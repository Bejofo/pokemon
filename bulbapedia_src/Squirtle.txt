'''Squirtle''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ゼニガメ''' ''Zenigame'') is a {{type|Water}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Wartortle}} starting at [[level]] 16, which evolves into {{p|Blastoise}} starting at [[level]] 36.

Along with {{p|Bulbasaur}} and {{p|Charmander}}, Squirtle is one of the three [[Kanto first partner Pokémon|first partner Pokémon of Kanto]] available at the beginning of [[Pokémon Red and Green Versions|Pokémon Red, Green]], [[Pokémon Red and Blue Versions|Blue]], [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Versions|FireRed, and LeafGreen]].

==Biology==
[[File:May Squirtle Withdraw.png|thumb|left|200px|Squirtle in its shell]]
Squirtle is a small {{wp|reptile|reptilian}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that resembles a light-blue {{wp|Testudines|turtle}}. While it typically walks on its two short legs, it has been shown to run on all fours in [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]. It has large, purplish, or reddish eyes and a slightly hooked upper lip. Each of its hands and feet has three pointed digits. The end of its long, squirrel-like tail curls inward. Its body is encased by a tough shell that forms and hardens after birth. This shell is brown on the top, pale yellow on the bottom, and has a thick white ridge between the two halves.

Squirtle's shell is a useful tool. It can withdraw into its shell for protection or to sleep. The grooved, rounded shape helps to reduce water resistance, allowing the Pokémon to swim at high speeds. Squirtle can spray foamy water from its mouth with great accuracy. Squirtle is scarce in the wild, although it can be found {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Water's Edge Pokémon|around small ponds and lakes}}. Squirtle can also be found residing around rivers in mountainous regions, as shown in {{g|Snap}} and {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}. In the {{aniseries|OS}} episode ''[[EP060|Beach Blank-Out Blastoise]]'', Squirtle is shown to be found living on secluded islands with other members of their [[evolution]]ary line. {{p|Sharpedo}} is a natural predator of Squirtle. As shown in {{g|Sleep}}, Squirtle is known to sleep by withdrawing its limbs and head into its shell.<ref>[[Pokémon Sleep|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref>  It does this to protect itself from threats while sleeping. It also occasionally rocks contentedly from side to side while sleeping. Squirtle has four different sleep styles: ''Sheltered Sleep'', ''Unsheltered Sleep'', ''Overturned Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''.

In [[Generation II]], Squirtle and its evolved forms were the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Skull Bash}} naturally, but other Pokémon could still inherit it via {{pkmn|breeding}}.

====Trophy information====
''"A Tiny Turtle Pokémon. In times of danger, it pulls its arms and legs inside its shell to protect from enemy attacks. When it conceals its neck, it also shoots a powerful stream of water from its mouth. Its shell not only protects its body, but also reduces water friction when in the water. When leveled up, it evolves into Wartortle."''

Squirtle's always a popular choice, what with it being so gosh-darn adorable. When it's in danger, though, it withdraws into its shell and spits a high-pressure burst of water—a bit less adorable.''

'''PAL''': ''At the start of their Pokémon adventures, many aspiring trainers visit Professor Oak to choose one of three first partner Pokémon.

==Trivia==
[[File:Niue Dollar Pokémon.png|thumb|250px|$1 coins from {{wp|Niue}}]]
* There was a scene in the 2004 film ''{{wp|Godzilla: Final Wars}}'' where a boy throws an action figure of Squirtle into a fire and insults it; the [[Pokémon]] franchise was deemed as the biggest rival of the {{wp|Godzilla}} franchise at that time, and this is also a presumed reference to {{wp|Gamera}}.<ref>[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaFinalWars Film / Godzilla: Final Wars]</ref><ref>Mark Schaefer, 2004, [https://web.archive.org/web/20050203181104/http://www.pennyblood.com/godzilla2.html Godzilla Stomps into Los Angeles] (archived), Penny Blood</ref>
* {{wp|Niue}} released in 2001 a one-dollar coin featuring Squirtle as part of a commemorative promotion for the [[Pokémon]] franchise, with Squirtle on one side and the nation's coat of arms on the other.

===Concept and development===
Squirtle and Wartortle were designed by [[Atsuko Nishida]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19980121112202fw_/http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/POKEMON/INTER/ATSUKO/INTER_AT.HTM)</ref>

===Origin===
Squirtle's design is based on both its final evolved form and baby {{wp|turtle}}s,<ref name=Origin>[https://web.archive.org/web/20211108083831/https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/creator-profile-the-creators-of-pikachu/ Creator Profile: The Creators of Pikachu - Pokemon.com] (archived)</ref> though its anatomy and semi-aquatic lifestyle are much more similar to {{wp|terrapin}}s, with proportions matching those of the {{wp|big-headed turtle}}. Much like Wartortle, its tail is a reference to Japanese legends of the ''{{wp|Cultural depictions of turtles#Japan|minogame}}'' (蓑亀), a turtle which lived for 10,000 years and grew a tail made of {{wp|seaweed}}.

====Name origin====
<!--Do NOT add squirrel. Just because both Squirtle and Squirrel have "Squir", doesn't mean it comes from squirrel. Squirtle is also not a squirrel.-->
Squirtle is a combination of ''squirt'' (to spray) and ''turtle''. The name was chosen in apparent reference to {{wp|water gun}}s, which were thought of as "cool" toys for children.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19990221135156/http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/POKEMON/NEWS/NEWS.HTM GAME FREAK | POCKEMON JOURNAL] (archive)</ref> "Squirt" is also a slang term for a small child.

Zenigame may be a combination of 銭 ''zeni'' (money) and 亀 ''kame'' (turtle), forming the word 銭亀 ''zenigame'' (baby {{wp|Japanese pond turtle}}). According to {{game|Black and White|s}}'s television program ''{{DL|Television|PokéQuiz}}'', "'Zeni' is an old-fashioned word for money. Squirtle's shells look like old coins, so that's how they got their name!"
