'''Persian''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ペルシアン''' ''Persian'') is a {{type|Normal}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s from {{p|Meowth}} starting at [[level]] 28.

In [[Alola]], Persian has a {{type|Dark}} [[regional form]]. It evolves from Alolan Meowth when leveled up with high [[friendship]].

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for these details.)

==Biology==
Persian is a large, quadrupedal, {{wp|Felidae|feline}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. Its fur is pale tan with the exception of its black-rimmed ears. It has a short muzzle with a small, black nose, red eyes with slit pupils, rounded ears, a pair of pointed teeth in its upper jaw, and three whiskers on either side of its face. Its thick whiskers are very sensitive to changes in air movements, enabling it to detect its prey by movement alone. In the center of its forehead is a red jewel. Its long tail has a distinctive curl at the end. Persian communicates with body language and holds its tail upright to signal its intention to pounce. It has long legs and three-toed paws with retractable claws. Persian's lithe muscles also enable it to walk without making a sound.

Persian normally lives in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Urban Pokémon|towns and cities}}. Although popular for its elegance, it is extremely difficult to raise as a pet due to its fickle and temperamental personality. It will scratch anyone, including its Trainer, with little or no provocation, and has been observed ripping its prey apart for no discernible reason. However, when Persian is yanked by its whiskers, it becomes temporarily docile for unknown reasons. It is popular among rich people and is targeted by hunters for its jewel. Its relationship with {{p|Perrserker}} is one of mutual disdain, as Persian's refined and elegant personality clashes with Perrserker's barbaric nature. As mentioned in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Persian is known to clean and groom itself even when asleep.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref> Even when asleep, Persian maintains its striking and haughty expression.

Persian and its evolutionary relatives are the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Pay Day}} by leveling up.

===Forms===
Persian has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Alolan}} Persian.

Alolan Persian has a body that is similar to its regular counterpart, but it has blue-gray fur. Its appearance is due to the luxurious lifestyle it received from the past Alolan monarchy.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20171231042041/https://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/alolan-meowth/ | Alolan Meowth] (archived)</ref> Its face has a different shape, being larger and more rounded with noticeable jowls. Its eyes are usually in a half-closed state, and instead of a red forehead jewel, it has a blue jewel. The jewel, though different in appearance, is made of mostly the same material as the one on a regular Persian. 

Alolan Persian's distinctive face, along with its high-class softer-than-velvet fur coat, is admired by the people and Pokémon of Alola. Alolan Persian's face is seen as a symbol of great wealth. Additionally, Alolan Persian is considered to be a Pokémon of great beauty. The bigger and plumper an Alolan Persian's face is, the more beautiful it is considered. The rippling of Alolan Persian's fur in battle is said to have a beauty of its own. This has made Alolan Persian a very popular Pokémon in the Alola region. Due to its distinctive fame, Alolan Persian is well protected and cared for by the Alola region. Notably, strict inspections are required before tourists are granted permission to take one Alolan Persian to their home region.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20171224115816/https://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/alolan-persian/ | Alolan Persian] (archived)</ref> 

In behavior, it is described as highly intelligent and having an even higher opinion of itself. This prideful Pokémon looks down on everything other than itself. Alolan Persian is a very difficult Pokémon partner to use in battle. The reason is due to it being unwilling to bond with its Trainer. Alolan Persian is said to have formidable physical abilities in battle.

While battling, Alolan Persian puts on a refined act at first. However, it prefers to use underhanded tactics in battle. These tactics usually consist of surprise attacks to blindside foes, trickery, and even foul play like sucker punches. Because of these brutal tactics, it prefers to torture its weakened prey rather than finishing them off. This haughty personality has often caused it to underestimate opponents and be deceived by their counterattacks.

In [[Generation IX]], Alolan Persian is the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Fur Coat}} as an [[Ability]].

===Evolution===
Persian evolves from {{p|Meowth}}.

{{rf|Alolan}} Persian evolves from Alolan Meowth.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Persian (TCG)}}

==Trivia==
* Persian's number in the [[National Pokédex]] and the [[List of Pokémon by Alola Pokédex number in Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|Alola Pokédex]] in [[Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon]] are the same: 053.
* Persian was featured in the TCG as a {{ct|Darkness}} twice before Alolan Persian was introduced: first as {{TCG ID|EX Unseen Forces|Rocket's Persian ex|116}} in {{TCG|EX Unseen Forces}} in 2005; and second as {{TCG ID|EX Holon Phantoms|Persian δ|48}}, a {{TCG|Delta Species}} Pokémon from {{TCG|EX Holon Phantoms}}, in 2006.

===Origin===
Despite its namesake, Persian appears to be more based on large cats such as {{wp|leopard}}s and {{wp|cougar}}s than {{wp|Persian cat}}s. It also appears similar to {{wp|Siamese cat}}s and its category in Japanese is シャムネコ or "shamuneko" meaning "Siamese Cat". The gem on its head makes it resemble a {{wp|Carbuncle (mythology)|Carbuncle}}, a Latin American mythological beast that had a jewel on its forehead.

Unlike Kantonian Persian, Alolan Persian appears to be based more on domestic cats that underwent selective breeding, specifically those owned by royalty. In particular, its appearance greatly resembles a {{wp|British Shorthair}}, an imported breed known well for its large and rounded head and pronounced 'smile', which the breed developed through artificial selection as part of the process of developing its pedigree. Its blue jewel and gray fur may be a visual pun on the "British Blue" color variant. Due to its large head and mannerisms, it may also be a visual pun on the term of being "big-headed".

====Name origin====
Persian may refer to {{wp|Persian cat}}s or possibly {{wp|Persian leopard}}s. It could also be related to {{wp|purr}}, the onomatopoeia for the noise a cat makes when content.
