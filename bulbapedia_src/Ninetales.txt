'''Ninetales''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''キュウコン''' ''Kyukon'') is a {{type|Fire}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s from {{p|Vulpix}} when exposed to a [[Fire Stone]].

In [[Alola]], Ninetales has a dual-type {{2t|Ice|Fairy}} [[regional form]]. It evolves from Alolan Vulpix when exposed to an [[Ice Stone]]. These Ninetales can also be found in [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]].

==Biology==
Ninetales is a quadrupedal {{wp|canidae|canine}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} covered in thick, luxurious golden-white fur. It has a small mane of thicker fur around its neck and a long, fluffy crest atop its head. It has slender legs with three-toed paws and nine long tails with pale orange tips. It has red eyes, pointed ears, and a triangular black nose.

A legend claims that Ninetales is the [[Human–Pokémon transformation|reincarnation]] of 9 united noble saints. While intelligent enough to easily understand human speech, Ninetales is a vengeful Pokémon known to curse those who mistreat it. Ninetales will also curse anyone who wakes it up by grabbing one of its many tails. The curse can last up to 1,000 years.  As mentioned in [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team]], once a Ninetales casts its curse, it cannot be removed even by Ninetales itself. It can live for 1,000 years due to the energy within its nine tails, each of which is said to have a different mystical power. Flames spewed from its mouth can hypnotize an opponent and its gleaming red eyes are said to give it the ability to control minds. As mentioned in the [[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]], Ninetales is known to sleep while wrapped inside its tails, giving it a mystical appearance.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex entry]]: "Its nine gorgeous tails are said to be imbued with supernatural power. When it sleeps wrapped in its tails, this Pokémon has a mystical appearance, but grabbing one of its many tails to wake it up for fun could result in a 1,000-year curse."</ref> In the [[M01|first Pokémon movie]], it's shown that it can swim. [[Pokémon-Amie]] shows that Ninetales lick their paws to clean themselves. Being the result of an Evolution via [[Evolution stone]], Ninetales are rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|grasslands}}.

===Forms===
Ninetales has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Alolan}} Ninetales.

In the [[Alola]] region, Ninetales have a different appearance. Its coat is pale blue, and its fur is more flowing and wispier. The tips of its tails and crest and the lower halves of its legs are white. The crest on its head is longer, and its nine tails are less distinct. Additionally, it has larger blue eyes and small tufts of fur in front of its ears.

Alolan Ninetales lives on Alola's snow-capped [[Mount Lanakila]], which some consider holy ground. As such, it is revered as a sacred messenger or deity. Alolan Ninetales has a gentle and calm temperament and is known to aid lost humans in distress, though this is primarily done to keep them out of its territory. It will punish any threat to its pack of {{p|Vulpix}}. Those who anger it will be frozen stiff in an instant. It can produce ice crystals from its fur, which it can use for both offense and defense. The ice crystals can act as a shield or form balls that can be fired like bullets with enough force to shatter rock.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20171219113756mp_/https://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/alolan-ninetales/ Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Alolan Ninetales]</ref> They can also be found in the [[Polar Biome]] of [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]], where Alola's island life is simulated. As mentioned in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Alolan Ninetales can be seen sparkling in its sleep while it bathes the area around it with powdery snow.

===Evolution===
Ninetales evolves from {{p|Vulpix}}.

{{rf|Alolan}} Ninetales evolves from Alolan Vulpix.

===NPC appearances===

The player is blamed for this and travels to the home of Ninetales at the top of [[Mt. Freeze]] to learn the truth. Ninetales appears again when {{p|Gengar}} wishes to make right what he did to {{p|Gardevoir}}. He gives Gengar the 9-Tail Crest and sends him and the player to [[Murky Cave]].
* {{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}}: Ninetales returns, asking the player to visit its hideout. Upon arrival, the player will [[Connection Orb|connect]] with both Ninetales and Absol.

===Concept and development===
Ninetales and its pre-Evolution were designed by [[Atsuko Nishida]].<ref name="fun's project">[https://funs-project.com/poplab/007/index_2.html Fun's Project interview with Atsuko Nishida (Page 2)]</ref>

===Origin===
Ninetales is based on a {{wp|fox}}.<ref name="fun's project"/> It may be based on a {{wp|red fox}} and the 狐 ''{{wp|kitsune}}'' of {{wp|Japanese mythology|Japanese legend}}, which are said to have many tails, extremely long lifespans, and supernatural powers such as the ability to breathe fire. After reaching an advanced age, ''kitsune'' take on {{wp|spirit}} forms, which may explain why Ninetales can learn various {{type|Ghost}} and {{type|Psychic}} moves. Specifically, it may be based on the ''kyūbi no kitsune'', whose fur turns white-gold after it has lived for 1,000 years and gains its ninth tail.

Alolan Ninetales may be based on an {{wp|Arctic fox}}, which grows a white coat of fur in the winter to {{wp|camouflage}} in the snow. Its mountain habitat and lore as a deity incarnation may be a reference to {{wp|Poliʻahu}}, the {{wp|Hawaiian}} goddess of snow who is said to reside on {{wp|Mauna Kea}}. It could also be inspired by ''tulikettu'', a mythical fox creature of Finnish lore whose radiant fur is said to be responsible for the creation of the {{wp|Aurora|northern lights}}, tying in to it being able to use {{m|Aurora Veil}}. The Finnish word for aurora, ''revontulet'', also literally translates to "fox fires" which could be intentional as Ninetales' original form is a Fire-type.

====Name origin====
Ninetales may be a combination of ''nine'' and ''tales'', referring to ''{{wp|fairy tale}}s'' (alluding to it being based on a mythical creature) as well as being a homophone to ''tails''. It may also reference the {{wp|cat o' nine tails}} whip (due to its tendency to punish anyone who grabs its tails).

Kyukon may be a combination of 九 ''kyū'' (nine) or 九尾狐 ''kyūbiko'' ({{wp|Fox spirit|nine-tailed fox}}) and こん ''kon'' (onomatopoetic sound of a fox's cry). It may also involve 旧恨 ''kyūkon'' (old grudge) and 焜炉 ''konro'' ({{wp|gas stove}}).
