'''Iron Leaves''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''テツノイサハ''' ''Tetsunoisaha'') is a dual-type {{2t|Grass|Psychic}} [[Paradox Pokémon]] introduced during [[Generation IX]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

It is said to be either a future relative of {{p|Virizion}} or a counterpart of it from a parallel timeline.

It was revealed alongside {{p|Walking Wake}} during the [[Pokémon Presents]] that aired on February 27, 2023, and debuted that same day in [[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet]]'s Version 1.2.0 update.

==Biology==
[[File:JP Championships 2024 Art Iron Leaves.png|thumb|left|200px|Iron Leaves extending its blades while using {{m|Psyblade}}]]
Iron Leaves is a mechanical {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that resembles a futuristic stag or {{wp|antelope}}-like, quadrupedal that is primarily green and grey. On the sides of its head are long metal horns that end in half-circle points. It has a silver snout with a bright red blaze running from its horn to the back of its head, with white spots inside of the blaze. The eyes are bright digital red. Iron Leaves's face, neck, hind legs, and underside are grey. The grey parts of its body have several dark grey lines connecting to different parts. The neck is covered by three green circles of armor. The middle circle has a green-tipped leaf on each side of its neck connected to a small green circle. The leaves have a bright red tip and white spots. The upper half of the body has a green armor plating, connected to three pointed tufts of fur forming a medium-long tail and two large spikes on each side of the tail. The front legs connect to green armor with three leafy tufts shaped like wings and green cylinder armor with a half-circle tip. The hind legs are connected to green leg armor. Its four legs resemble knee-high, green armor boots with bright red diamond highlights at the knees with white spots. The legs end in black hooves. 

Iron Leaves resembles a sketch made by a member of the Area Zero Expedition in the [[Violet Book]]. According to Occulutre, its appearance resembles a {{p|Virizion}} from the future. It has a smooth, glossy body that has a metallic texture. The glowing parts on its forehead and leaves can transformed into ethereal swords<ref>[https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon/iron_leaves/ Pokémon Scarlet and Violet official site]</ref> and can be {{m|Psyblade|used during combat}} to rend its targets. These sword strikes are powerful enough to cut large trees and boulders into short, thin strips. When it falls asleep, it turns itself off, causing the red energy on its head, leaves, and legs to turn black.

According to [[Professor Turo|AI Turo]], Iron Leaves is a future Pokémon related to Virizion. However, according to a version of Professor Turo that appeared at the [[Crystal Pool]], Iron Leaves is a counterpart of Virizion from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. Iron Leaves was brought to the depths of [[Area Zero]] by a [[time machine]] built by Professor Turo ten years ago. 200 years ago, [[Heath]] also encountered Iron Leaves, as seen in the Violet Book, though it is unclear how it arrived there at the time.

Iron Leaves is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Psyblade}}.

==Trivia==
[[File:Violet Book Sword-Justice.png|200px|thumb|Sketch resembling Iron Leaves in the Violet Book]]
* Before the official reveal of Iron Leaves, a sketch of an imaginary Pokémon similar to it appeared in the [[Violet Book]] in {{g|Violet}} as an amalgam of the [[Swords of Justice]] ({{p|Cobalion}}, {{p|Terrakion}}, and {{p|Virizion}}).
* Although Iron Leaves is part {{type|Psychic}}, the only damaging Psychic-type move that it can learn is its [[signature move]], {{m|Psyblade}}.
* Iron Leaves is the only Paradox Pokémon connected to [[Legendary Pokémon]] whose signature move's type matches the Pokémon's secondary type rather than its primary type.
* Iron Leaves and {{p|Walking Wake}} can be considered counterparts of one another.
** They are both {{pkmn2|event}}-exclusive [[Paradox Pokémon]] with [[signature move]]s that can be caught only once per save file.
** They are both based on a [[Legendary Pokémon]] that is a member of a [[Legendary trio]]. Despite being based on Legendary Pokémon, they are both not considered Legendary Pokémon themselves.
** They are the first Paradox Pokémon that can be encountered in a [[Tera Raid Battle]] and were both revealed and released simultaneously in the same [[Poké Portal News]] event and software update.
** They were both teased in the [[Scarlet Book]]{{sup/9|S}}/[[Violet Book]]{{sup/9|V}}, though neither of them appear in any editions of {{DL|Magazines in the Pokémon world|Occulture}} magazine.
** Prior to the release of [[The Indigo Disk]], their Pokédex entries in {{g|HOME}} were both only three words long and shared between Scarlet and Violet, but have been since replaced. Iron Leaves' placeholder entry said "Ecology under analysis."
* Iron Leaves, Walking Wake, and {{p|Pecharunt}} are the only Pokémon that can be registered but are not required for the completion of the Blueberry Pokédex.
* Iron Leaves is the only non-[[Legendary Pokémon|Legendary]] or [[Mythical Pokémon|Mythical]] Pokémon to have once been last in the [[List of Pokémon by National Pokédex number|National Pokédex]] order (between the release of [[Pokémon Scarlet and Violet]] Version 1.2.0 and [[The Teal Mask]]).

===Origin===
Iron Leaves is based on {{p|Virizion}}.

====Name origin====
Iron Leaves is literally ''iron leaves''.

Tetsunoisaha can be taken literally as 鉄の斑葉 ''tetsu no isaha'' (iron mottled leaves).
