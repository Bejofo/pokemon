'''Mawile''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''クチート''' ''Kucheat'') is a dual-type {{2t|Steel|Fairy}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation III]]. Prior to [[Generation VI]], it was a pure {{type|Steel}} Pokémon.

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Mawile can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Mawile''' using the [[Mawilite]].

==Biology==
Mawile is a short, bipedal, humanoid {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a pale yellow body. Its three-fingered hands and two-toed feet are black. It has red eyes and a pair of long, black, ear-like extensions on either side of its head. Its legs resemble a {{wp|hakama}}. Its most notable feature is a pair of large black jaws emerging from the back of its head. These jaws have a yellow, oval-shaped spot on their top surface. They contain ten sharp, metallic teeth—six on the top row and four on the bottom. While the jaws are actually transformed steel horns, Mawile can articulate them at will, using them to bite enemies with enough force to break an iron beam. These jaws are incapable of tasting, leading Mawile to use them to eat food it does not like.

Mawile is typically found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Cave Pokémon|caves}}. It uses its non-threatening facial appearance to make foes underestimate it, then attacks with its giant jaws, sometimes swallowing its prey whole. When engaged in battle, Mawile usually has its back turned to the enemy to make better use of its jaws. As mentioned in [[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]], Mawile tends to sleep while hugging its jaws occasionally. It is unknown whether it's a trap or not, unless one takes a closer look. Mawile has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: ''Flattened Sleep'', ''Jaw-Swinging Sleep'', ''Jaw-Hugging Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''.

===Forms===
Mawile can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Mawile.

Mega Mawile now has two sets of jaws protruding from the back of its head, and both sets have a spiky tuft of hair. It also seems to be able to control the jaws independently of one another.<ref>http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/pokemon/mega_pokemon/#Mawile</ref> The ear-like extensions on its head are longer and have tips with two points. Its legs have grown longer, and its "hakama" is now magenta. Its arms now resemble thick sleeves, with magenta markings around the wrists. Mega Mawile's strength has {{a|Huge Power|dramatically risen}} from its previous form, and it can use both its jaws to grip on prey and tear them apart. These jaws thrash around violently.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Mawile (TCG)}}

== Others ==

=== [[MELLOMELLOID]] ===
Mawile, alongside many other Fairy-type Pokémon, appears in the music video for the song "[https://youtu.be/TFpizvPDbec?si=kju3QG_MwE3uGTpx MELLOMELLOID]" ('''メロメロイド)''', composed by Vocaloid producer Kairiki Bear for the [[Pokémon feat. Hatsune Miku Project VOLTAGE 18 Types/Songs]]. Mawile's cute nature concealing its large jaws is reflected in the song through an idol who acts cutesy and friendly in order to trick a romantic partner close to her, before revealing her true nature, showing that she has been lying all this time to trap someone. The symbolism is further reinforced by Miku's twintails and color palette being stylized to ressemble Mawile's jaw, and later on Mega Mawile's two jaws.

==Trivia==
* Mawile's [[footprint]] is different between the [[Generation III]] {{pkmn|games}} ([[File:F303gen3.png]]) and the [[Generation IV]] games ([[File:F303.png]]).
* Since Mawile's back faces its opponent in battles, it uniquely uses its "back" sprite in [[Pokémon Musical]]s.
* Mawile seems to be the counterpart of {{p|Sableye}}. Both of them are [[version-exclusive Pokémon]] of {{2v2|Ruby|Sapphire}}, {{2v2|HeartGold|SoulSilver}}, {{pkmn|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, {{pkmn|Sword and Shield}}, and {{2v2|Brilliant Diamond|Shining Pearl}}, found in the same locations in each paired version. They have the same [[HP]], {{stat|Speed}}, and [[base stats|base stat totals]]. Both Pokémon also have [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolved]] forms.
* Prior to gaining the {{type|Fairy}}, Mawile was the first pure {{type|Steel}} Pokémon to be introduced.

===Origin===
{{bulbanews|On the Origin of Species: Mawile}}
Mawile may have been based on the Japanese legend of the ''{{wp|futakuchi-onna}}'', a woman with a mouth in the back of her head.  It may also be influenced by ''{{wp|ouni}}'', a demon with a torn mouth and a body covered in hair that lives in the mountains.

Its mouth resembles a {{wp|Trapping#Foothold traps|bear-trap}}, which may explain its unexpected {{t|Steel}} typing. This design choice might also align with its classification as the "Deceiver" Pokémon, using misdirection in its typing. Additionally, the Steel type could be a nod to the "silk hiding steel" metaphor.

====Name origin====
Mawile may be a combination of ''{{wp|maw}}'' (jaws of a voracious animal) and ''wile'' (cunning stratagem) or ''smile''.

Kucheat may be a combination of 口 ''kuchi'' (mouth) and ''cheat'' or ''eat''.
