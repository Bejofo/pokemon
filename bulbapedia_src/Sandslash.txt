'''Sandslash''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''サンドパン''' ''Sandpan'') is a {{type|Ground}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s from {{p|Sandshrew}} starting at [[level]] 22.

In [[Alola]], Sandslash has a dual-type {{2t|Ice|Steel}} [[regional form]]. It evolves from Alolan Sandshrew when exposed to an [[Ice Stone]]. These Sandslash can also be found in [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]].

==Biology==
[[File:Sandslash Pokécology.png|300px|left|thumb|Sandslash curls into a spiky ball and rolls, while Alolan Sandslash burrows through the ground with icy claws]]
Sandslash is a bipedal, ground-dwelling {{wp|pangolin|pholidote}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. Although Sandslash is usually bipedal, it can run on all fours. Most of its body is yellow with a white underbelly. It has a narrow muzzle, almond-shaped blue eyes, and a thick tail. Its back is mostly covered in sharp, brown quills from its tough, dry hide. It has two large claws on its paws and feet. These claws are its primary weapons and are used for slashing, but can also be used for burrowing. Its claws and spikes can both break off, but they grow back quickly and are shed regularly. Sandslash's broken parts can be used to carve plows for tilling farm fields. The claws can become harder and smoother if they live in drier areas.

Sandslash can curl into a large ball, which allows it to roll to attack or escape, protect itself from heatstroke, and guard its belly. Sandslash is also adept at climbing trees and is prone to ambush its enemies from above. It also climbs trees to rest during the night and to slash [[Berry|Berries]] to feed the {{p|Sandshrew}} waiting below. Sandslash is mostly found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Rough-terrain Pokémon|deserts}}.

===Forms===
Sandslash has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Alolan}} Sandslash.

In the [[Alola]] [[region]], Sandslash has an icy blue hide and steel quills covered in ice. These quills stand taller than a regular Sandslash's quills and resemble icicles. Unlike its Kantonian variant, Alolan Sandslash is rarely seen curling up into a ball, perhaps made difficult by its thick hide and icy spine. Instead, this Pokémon uses its hide for camouflage in the snow while exposing only its spines. Its body emits cold air, which sharpens its quills. Its forepaws are larger than its counterpart, and its claws are longer, thinner, and hooked at the tips. Formerly used for climbing trees, they now allow it to scale icebergs without slipping.

Despite the weight of its ice-covered body, Alolan Sandslash can {{a|Slush Rush|move swiftly}} by carving a path in the snow with its claws. It can move faster than any other Pokémon while in the snowy mountains. This Pokémon tends to live in the deeper parts of snowy mountains, where climbing is forbidden. However, the sprays of snow it kicks up are popular shots for photographers.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180911115757/https://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/alolan-sandslash/ Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Alolan Sandslash]</ref> People also climb up the mountains it lives in, to see Sandslash's icy spikes sparkle during the light of dawn. Stabs from Alolan Sandslash's spikes can cause both deep wounds and severe frostbite. They can also be found in the [[Polar Biome]] of [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]], where Alola's island life is simulated.

==Trivia==
* No other Pokémon has the same [[type]] [[List of Pokémon with unique type combinations|combination]] as Alolan Sandslash and its Alolan pre-evolved form.
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Sandslash's original name was "Sandstorm".
* Sandslash and its pre-evolved form both share their {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Rattata}}, {{p|Raticate}}, {{p|Pikachu}}, {{p|Raichu}}, {{p|Pawmi}}, and {{p|Pawmo}}. They are all known as the Mouse Pokémon, though Rattata and Raticate were originally called the Rat Pokémon prior to [[Generation III]].

===Origin===
{{bulbanews|On the Origin of Species: Sandshrew and Sandslash}}
Sandslash shares various physical traits with the {{wp|pangolin}}. It may also draw from {{wp|hedgehog}}s, {{wp|porcupine}}s, and {{wp|echidna}}s due to its coloration and having spikes instead of scales. Both Sandshrew and Sandslash are mentioned to have poisonous claws, similar to how some species of the {{wp|shrew}} are venomous.

Alolan Sandslash's quills resemble {{wp|icicle}}s and its hooked claws combined with its ability to ice climb seem to be inspired by {{wp|ice axe}}s.

====Name origin====
Sandslash may be a combination of ''sand'' and ''slash''.

Sandpan may be a combination of ''sand'' and ''{{wp|pangolin}}''.
