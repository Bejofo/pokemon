'''Mew''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ミュウ''' ''Mew'') is a {{type|Psychic}} [[Mythical Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation I]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

Mew is notable for its unique ability to learn every [[TM|Technical Machine]], [[TR|Technical Record]], [[HM|Hidden Machine]], and [[Move Tutor]] move (except those exclusive to a particular Pokémon or group of Pokémon, such as {{m|Volt Tackle}} and {{m|Secret Sword}}).

It is associated with {{p|Mewtwo}}, and thus they are collectively referred to as the [[Mew duo]] by fans.

Mew was first officially revealed in the May 1996 issue of [[CoroCoro]],<ref>https://www.zoidsland.com/1rebyu-/koro96-5.html</ref> less than two months after [[Pokémon Red and Green]] were released in Japan.

==Biology==
Mew is a pink, bipedal {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with {{wp|mammal}}ian features. It has a rounded, wide snout; triangular ears; and large, blue eyes. It has short arms with three-fingered paws and large hind paws with oval markings on the soles. Its tail is long and thin with an ovoid tip. Its fur is so fine and thin, it can only be seen under a microscope.

Mew has shown a playful, childish personality, showing signs of high intelligence, curiosity, shyness, playfulness, and even selflessness. It is said to have the {{wp|DNA}} of every single Pokémon contained within its body. This causes many scientists to theorize that Mew is the ancestor of all {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. It is an incredibly adaptable species, capable of levitation and teleportation. It can use almost all known [[move]]s, regardless of their [[type]]s. It has also shown the rare power to {{m|Transform|transform into all known Pokémon}}. It is capable of making itself invisible at will, so it entirely avoids notice even if it approaches people. As seen on several occasions, it has the ability to create an orb of energy around itself for protection, which can come in many colors, such as green, yellow, and pink.

According to [[Pokémon Mansion journals|journals]] found in [[Kanto]]'s {{ka|Pokémon Mansion}}, [[Mr. Fuji]] is the one who discovered Mew deep in the jungle and coined its name. With other scientists, he managed to gather some of Mew's DNA and used it in his mansion to create a modified clone of it, aiming it to be the most powerful Pokémon of all, which resulted in the birth of the [[Legendary Pokémon]] {{p|Mewtwo}}. Since Mew can make itself invisible, very few people have {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Rare Pokémon|seen it}}, leading some scientists to declare it extinct and most to assume it to be nothing, but a mirage. However, sightings of it are still being reported to this day, confirming its existence. Even though it's rarely seen, it will willingly show itself to a person who is pure of heart and has a strong desire to see it.

According to the ''[[Pokémon the Series]]''-related radio drama, ''[[The Birth of Mewtwo]]'', Mew was discovered by [[Jessie]]'s mother, [[Miyamoto]], who registered its cry in a forest 20 years before the events of the series. It was worshiped for its protection by ancient people who created a song in its honor and believed it appeared once a year with the rising sun. It wasn't rediscovered until 18 years after Miyamoto met Mew by sunrise on the peak of a high mountain. As depicted in the episode ''[[JN134|In the Palms of our Hands!]]'' it is capable of splitting itself up and transforming into more than one Pokémon at the same time. [[Mew (M01)|It]] was also shown to possess a strong rivalry with its clone, [[Mewtwo (M01)|Mewtwo]] in ''[[M01|Mewtwo Strikes Back]]''.

Mew is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of using the [[Z-Move]] {{m|Genesis Supernova}}.

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
{{spoilers}}
* {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}}: Mew is the guardian of the [[Seven Treasures|Grass Cornet]].
* {{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}}: The {{OBP|partner Pokémon|Mystery Dungeon}} was Mew in their former life, working to fight against [[Dark Matter]] and creating the [[Harmony Scarf|Harmony Scarves]]. In the post-game, the [[Hero Pokémon|hero]] goes to the {{OBP|Mystery Jungle|Super Mystery Dungeon}} and meets a different Mew, who is later revealed to have the partner's spirit sealed inside them.
* [[PokéPark Wii: Pikachu's Adventure]]: Mew takes Pikachu and their friends {{p|Chikorita}}, {{p|Piplup}}, and {{p|Charmander}} to the {{ga|PokéPark}}. He then appears to Pikachu in a dream once they've arrived in the PokéPark and tells Pikachu to collect pieces of the [[Sky Prism]] so that peace can be restored to the PokéPark. Once all the pieces have been obtained, Mew awaits Pikachu at the [[Sky Pavilion]] where he plays. In this game, Mew is referred to as male, despite having {{DL|gender|unknown gender}} in the [[core series]].

===Pokédex entries===
The Pokédex entry from Japanese [[Pokémon Blue (Japanese)|Pokémon Blue]] and [[Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen Versions|LeafGreen]] had some localization changes:

* 「いまでも まぼろしの ポケモンと いわれる。そのすがたを みたものは ぜんこくでも ほとんど いない。」 (''It is still called a Mythical Pokémon. Its shape was seen by almost no one in the entire country.''){{sup/1|B}}{{sup/3|LG}}
*: This entry uses the Japanese term for [[Mythical Pokémon]] (literally: ''Illusory Pokémon''), but it predates the definitive [[Terminology of Legendary and Mythical Pokémon|split between Legendary and Mythical]] in English media. The localization calls Mew a "mirage" instead.
*: In the localization, Mew is said to be a mirage by "many experts". However, the Japanese text does not mention any experts.
*: In Japanese, it is said that almost no one has seen Mew in the entire country ({{ruby|全国|ぜんこく}}). In English, this was changed to "worldwide".

In the German version of [[Pokémon Stadium]], Mew's entry does not mention South America; instead, it says that Mew has been seen in "Niemandsland" (''No Man's Land'').

==Other appearances==
[[File:SSBB Mew.png|thumb|200px|Mew in [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]]]
[[File:Mew 3DS trophy SSB4.png|thumb|150px|Mew trophy in Super Smash Bros. for 3DS]]
===Super Smash Bros. series===
In [[Super Smash Bros.]], Mew will sometimes appear out of a {{i|Poké Ball}}. When summoned, it will use {{m|Fly}} to leave the arena. In single-player, the summoner is awarded the "Mew Catcher" bonus, worth 15,000 points.

After unlocking every character in [[Super Smash Bros. Melee]], there is a 1 in 251 chance of Mew appearing from a Poké Ball. The thrower of the Poké Ball receives the same "Mew Catcher" bonus.

Mew returns again as a rare Pokémon in [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]], the chance of it appearing is 1 in 493 this time. Like the other "secret" Pokémon, it drops rare items instead of just flying away. In Mew's case, the items are CDs. However, once all the pick-up CDs are obtained, it will drop Stickers instead.

Mew returns in [[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U]] and comes out of a Poké Ball (rarely) and/or Master Ball (rare, but less rare than a Poké Ball).

Mew returns yet again in [[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]], once again as a rare Poké Ball summon, but also as a {{sbw|Spirit}}.

Throughout the series, Mew, much like Mewtwo, is roughly akin to its portrayal in [[M01|the first movie]], especially having Kōichi Yamadera reprise his role.

====Melee trophy information====
''Mew is an extremely rare Pokémon that has been seen by only a few people. Information on every Pokémon in the world is contained in Mew's cell structure, so it has the ability to use any and all TMs and HMs. Some Pokémon scholars believe Mew to be the ancestor of all existing Pokémon, but the idea is debatable.''

====Brawl trophy information====
''"A New Species Pokémon. An extremely rare Pokémon that contains the DNA of all other Pokémon, it is thought by many scholars to be a Pokémon ancestor, considering the wide range of moves it can use. On top of being able to make itself invisible, Mew can also {{m|transform}} into any opponent Pokémon and use characteristics and moves in exactly the same way."''

====3DS/Wii U trophy information====
Mew appears as a trophy in both versions of the game.

'''NA''': ''Mew is a Pokémon previously thought to be extinct but rediscovered by [[Mr. Fuji|Dr. Fuji]]. This Legendary Pokémon doesn't often show itself to humans, so it is considered quite lucky to see one. In Smash Bros., Mew will appear and then use Fly to sail away, leaving behind a gift. Thanks, Mew! ''

'''PAL''': ''Mew was thought to be extinct until it was rediscovered by Dr. Fuji in Guyana. This Mythical Pokémon doesn't often show itself to humans, so it's considered very lucky to see one. In this game, it will float upwards and leave a present behind. If only Mew would turn up more often, eh?''

[[File:SnapMew.png|thumb|Mew in [[Pokémon Snap]]]]
[[File:UNITE Mew.png|thumb|left|150px|Mew in Pokémon UNITE]]
==={{g|Snap}}===
Mew appears in the seventh course, [[Rainbow Cloud]]. Although the game is not combat-oriented, the difficulty of photographing Mew effectively makes it the game's boss. Mew floats in a bubble that turns opaque when the zoom is activated, so players must throw a series of [[Pester Ball]]s or Food at it to break the bubble so Mew will come out for a clear shot. Photographing Mew gets an automatic bonus of 2,500 points, making it the highest-ranking Pokémon in the game with the highest possible score of 10,000 points with perfect positioning, size, and pose.

===[[Pokémon UNITE]]===
{{main|Mew (UNITE)}}
Mew is playable through obtaining a Unite License. It is a ranged attacker.

===Celestial===
Mew appeared in the music video for [[Celestial]] by [[Ed Sheeran]].

==Trivia==
[[File:Mew Discovery Date.png|thumb|right|Mew's discovery date.]]
* Mew was designed by Shigeki Morimoto, which he states at the [[Heahea City]] [[GAME FREAK]] office. This included its pixel art, cry and Pokédex entry (the one reused in {{g|FireRed}}). He also says it was right at the very end of game development.
* Despite being a clone of Mew, {{p|Mewtwo}} appears before Mew in the [[Pokédex]].
* Mew is the only {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} out of the first 151 to be left out of the original version of the [[Kanto Pokérap|Pokérap]].
* In [[Generation I|Generations I]] and {{gen|II}}, due to technical limitations, Mew's [[Pokémon category|category name]], ''New Species'', is labeled in game as ''NEW SPECIE'' (and in early versions, labeled as ''NEWSPECIES'').
* Mew was a little-known secret when {{game|Red and Green|s}} were first released in Japan. Even [[Nintendo]] was not initially aware that [[Shigeki Morimoto]] had programmed it into the game.<ref name=IwataAsks>[https://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/ds/pokemon/0/0/ Iwata Asks - Pokémon HeartGold Version & SoulSilver Version]</ref>
** According to Shigeki Morimoto, the cartridges for Pokémon Red and Green had about 300 bytes of free space left after the debugging process was complete, and he thought of slotting Mew in as a last-minute addition, even after he was told not to tamper with the games post-debugging.<ref name=IwataAsks/> However, Pokémon Red and Green are 373 kilobytes in size and are housed in 512 kilobyte cartridges.<ref>[https://www.thegamer.com/pokemon-file-size-every-core-game/ The File Size Of Every Core Pokemon Game] - ''The Gamer''.</ref><ref>https://datacrystal.romhacking.net/wiki/Pokémon_Red_and_Blue</ref>
** In an interview with [[Game Freak]] and [[Creatures, Inc.]] in [[Nintendo Power]] issue 134, Shigeki Morimoto revealed that he created Mew two weeks before game development was finished.<ref>''Nintendo Power'' Vol. 134, July 2000, p.78-79 ([http://www.rigelatin.net/copycat/media/print/np134.php excerpt])</ref>
* In the [[core series]], Mew can only be fought as a [[wild Pokémon]] on [[Faraway Island]] in {{game|Emerald}}. However, this requires the [[Old Sea Map]], an [[event item]] only distributed in Japan and Taiwan.
* Mew has the most {{pkmn|animated series}} opening appearances of any Mythical Pokémon, with seven in Japan.
* Because Mew can learn any TM:
** It is the only [[Gender unknown|gender-unknown]] Pokémon species that is legitimately able to learn {{m|Captivate}}, and one of the few that can learn {{m|Attract}}. Both moves fail when used by any Pokémon with unknown gender, including Mew.
** It is the only Pokémon that can learn {{m|Frenzy Plant}}, {{m|Blast Burn}}, {{m|Hydro Cannon}}, {{m|Draco Meteor}}, {{m|Grass Pledge}}, {{m|Fire Pledge}}, {{m|Water Pledge}}, and {{m|Steel Beam}} that doesn't share a type with the move.
* In [[Super Smash Bros.]], Mew has a chance of 1 out of 151 to appear; in [[Super Smash Bros. Melee]], its chance to appear is 1 out of 251; and in [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]], its chance to appear is 1 out of 493. This is a reference to how many Pokémon were out during the release of each game (151 in [[Generation I]], 251 in [[Generation II]], and 493 in [[Generation IV]]).
[[File:Wildmew.png|thumb|right|A wild Mew found using the [[Mew glitch]]]]
* The US release of Mew as an event for {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}} happened on the ten-year anniversary of the original release of {{2v2|Gold|Silver}}.
* In 2012, Mew was voted the most popular Legendary/Mythical Pokémon in the {{n|Official Pokémon website announces Pokémon Power Bracket|Pokémon Power Bracket}}, which consisted of all Legendary and Mythical Pokémon from the first four [[generation]]s.
* Mew started the trend of every generation until [[Generation VI]] introducing a Mythical Pokémon with a base stat total of 600 and a stat distribution of 100 all around. Others that follow this trend include {{p|Celebi}}, {{p|Jirachi}}, {{p|Manaphy}}, {{fd|Shaymin|Land Forme}} {{p|Shaymin}}, and {{p|Victini}}.
* At [[SM042|981 episodes]] (and over two decades), Mew is the Pokémon species that has taken the longest to physically debut in the animated series from the start of their generation out of any Pokémon thus far.
* The only ways to legitimately obtain a {{Shiny}} Mew are via the Generation II {{DL|List of PCNY event Pokémon distributions in Generation II|Shiny Mew|Gotta Catch Em All Event}} in Thanksgiving 2002, the [[Old Sea Map]] on a Japanese copy of {{game|Emerald}}, or through the [https://www.leekduck.com/shiny-mew-masterwork-research/ Pokémon GO Mew Masterwork Research] quest, which was available for a limited time in Pokémon GO during the Pokémon GO Tour: Kanto event and then became available again for players who missed purchasing it the first time for a few days in early July 2023.
** Only the latter two can exist in modern games, as Generation II's "Gotta Catch Em All" Shiny Mew cannot legitimately be [[transfer]]red to Generation III or later.
** Mew is the only Pokémon that can be Shiny while having the [[Mark|Mightiest Mark]].
* Mew is tied with {{p|Muk}} for the shortest English name of all Pokémon.
** Mew has the shortest Korean name of all Pokémon, only consisting of one hangul character.
* Mew is the only Pokémon obtainable in [[Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!]] that cannot have the [[Pokémon GO]] [[origin mark]] ([[File:GO icon VIII.png|16px|GO origin mark]]) in said games.
* Mew is the only [[Mythical Pokémon]] introduced in Generation I.
* As of [[Generation IX]], Mew is the only Generation I Pokémon that does not appear in any regional Pokédex other than [[List of Pokémon by Kanto Pokédex number|Kanto]] and [[List of Pokémon by Johto Pokédex number|Johto]].
* The symbol for the {{TCG|Fusion Strike}} expansion [[File:SetSymbolFusion Strike.png|30px]] resembles Mew's tail surrounded by [[Dynamax]] clouds.

===Origin===
{{Bulbanews|On the Origin of Species: Mew}}
Designer Shigeki Morimoto stated that Mew's design was based on Mewtwo. Its design was made simpler than Mewtwo in order to take up less space on the cartridge.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyXDpFd1CQk The Untold Origin Story of Mythical Pokémon "Mew" and "Mewtwo"! (Game Freak "Secret Base" #39)] - Game Freak Official YouTube Channel (Japanese)</ref><ref>[https://nintendoeverything.com/game-freaks-shigeki-morimoto-on-mew-why-it-was-initially-rare-design-more/ Game Freak’s Shigeki Morimoto on Mew – why it was initially rare, design, more] - ''Nintendo Everything''.</ref>

Mew's overall physical appearance appears to be based on domestic {{wp|cat}}s. Several of Mew's features, such as a short muzzle and large hind feet, are commonly found in cats. Its morphology is also vaguely similar to a {{wp|jerboa}}, having large hind legs and a long skinny tail. Mew's earliest design in [[Pokémon Red and Green Versions|Pokémon Red and Green]] resembled a vertebrate {{wp|embryo}}, featuring a large head and small body. Mew was soon revised and became mostly mammalian with cat-like traits, while still retaining several embryonic features such as having short fine hair and small forearms. Mew is believed by scientists to be the {{wp|last universal common ancestor}} of all other Pokémon, which, along with its resemblance to an embryo, may be a reference to the {{wp|recapitulation theory}}.

====Name origin====
Mew may be a combination of ''{{wp|mutant}}'' or ''{{wp|mutation}}'' and ''new''. It may also involve 妙 ''myō'' (wonderful, exquisite).

According to Julien Bardakoff, the French localizer for [[Pokémon Red and Blue Versions|Pokémon Red and Blue]], he asked if Mew's name was based on the English onomatopoeia for a cat's meow and was explicitly told it was not.<ref>[https://www.liberation.fr/apps/2016/06/pokemon/ Libération.fr – Pokémon, traduisez-les tous]</ref>
