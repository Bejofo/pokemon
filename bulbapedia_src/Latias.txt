'''Latias''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ラティアス''' ''Latias'') is a dual-type {{2t|Dragon|Psychic}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation III]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Latias can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Latias''' using the [[Latiasite]].

It is a member of the [[eon duo]] along with {{p|Latios}}.

==Biology==
[[File:Latias invisible anime.png|thumb|left|250px|Latias's invisibility powers]]
Latias is a {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a birdlike body stylized after a plane. Its long neck stretches forward from its squat body. It has no legs, usually floating instead. The rear half of its body is largely red and the upper half white, with jet-plane wings high on its rear and fins on the bottom near its tail. A blue triangle marks the center of its chest, while a red mask partially covers its face. Ear-like fins sit on top of its head and its eyes are yellow. It has short, three-fingered arms with a red covering on the outer side of the lower arms. Latias is a female-only species, with {{p|Latios}} being its male counterpart.

Latias ruffles its feathers and cries loudly when there is hostility toward it. Its glass-like, downy feathers can enfold its body and refract light, which allows it to become invisible or alter its appearance. It is gentle, highly intelligent, and can understand human speech. It is capable of using telepathy to communicate with others. [[Latias (M05)|In the fifth movie]], {{adv|Eon duo|in Pokémon Adventures}}, and in {{aniseries|JN}}, Latias had the ability "Sight Sharing", which allowed Latias and people around it to see exactly what Latios was seeing. It normally does not make contact with humans or other Pokémon and disappears when an enemy is nearby. It forms herds with several members and is usually found {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Water's-edge Pokémon|near water}}. As seen in [[Pokémon Horizons: The Series|''Pokémon Horizons'']], like other [[Legendary Pokémon]], Latias can be found in the Pokémon paradise [[Laqua]]. Latias loves [[Latias Treat]]s made by [[Snacksworth]], who once encountered it in the past. Latias can be summoned by the [[Eon Flute]].

Latias is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Mist Ball}}.

===Forms===
Latias can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into Mega Latias.

As Mega Latias, the red parts of its body change to purple. Horns grow from the side of its head and run along its jaw. It loses the wings on its back and similar but larger wings attach to its lower arms, normally held in a level position. Triangle shapes now mark the forward point of its wings instead of its chest.

Mega Latias is said to be one of the fastest Pokémon in existence. Mega Latias reach a speed of Mach 4 while outpacing a jet in flight. Due to being smaller than Mega Latios, Mega Latias is much more agile and can make very sharp turns.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150202062726/http://www.pokemonrubysapphire.com/en-us/pokemon/the-eon-pokemon-appear Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire site | Mega Latias]</ref>

In Pokémon Emerald, the roaming Pokémon is chosen in a sequence immediately after the credits where, after hearing a [[television]] report, the player is asked the color of the Pokémon in it. If red is selected, Latias roams Hoenn and Latios is found at the island. If blue is selected, Latias is found at the island and Latios roams Hoenn.

==Trivia==
[[File:Latias Blaziken.jpg|thumb|200px|Pre-alpha sketch of the unused Pokémon]]
* Latias shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Latios}}. They are both known as the Eon Pokémon.
* A pre-alpha sketch depicts an [[List of unused Pokémon and character designs|unused Pokémon]] or alternative form of Latias with the traits of both a Latias and a {{p|Blaziken}}.
* Latias is the last [[Generation III]] Pokémon to appear in an {{pkmn|animated series}} episode, debuting in ''[[JN137|The Road Most Traveled!]]''.

===Origin===
Latias and Latios appear to be a cross between a {{wp|Jet aircraft|jet plane}} (due to their wing shape and speedy flight), a {{wp|dragon}}, a {{wp|griffin}}, and a bird. Like many birds, Latias is said to possess {{wp|down feathers}}. In particular, their lack of feet and continuous levitation might be inspired by the {{wp|common swift}}, a bird with tiny feet (its Latin name ''Apus'' means ''without feet'') that spends most of its life in the air. Similarly, they might be inspired by the {{wp|martlet}}, a mythical bird in English heraldry that never roosts and is usually depicted with tufts of feathers in place of feet. Their red and blue plumage might be based on parrots in the genus {{wp|Eos (bird)|Eos}}. They could also be based on {{wp|junglefowl}} due to their possible {{DL|List of unused Pokémon and character designs|Blaziken / Latias|shared origin}} with {{p|Blaziken}}.

Due to their classification as ''Eon'' Pokémon and their connection to the [[Soul Dew]], Latias and Latios might be inspired by the {{wp|Aeon (Gnosticism)|aeons in Gnosticism}}, which are said to be emanations of God. In {{wp|Valentinianism}}, these aeons form male/female pairs called syzygies. They may also be loosely based on the Chinese philosophical concept of {{wp|yin and yang}}, which are opposite but interconnected natural forces. Latias, being female and the more passive of the two, would represent yin. Their names and Latias's ability to refract light might also be a reference to {{wp|Eos}}, the Greek goddess of dawn.

====Name origin====
Latias may be a combination of ''lateō'' (Latin for ''I conceal'', ''I lie hidden'') and ''-as'' (Latin feminine suffix). It might also reference ''{{wp|Eos}}'' (the Greek goddess of dawn) or ''{{wp|Eos (bird)|Eos}}'' (a genus of parrots with red and blue plumage). It's possible that its name is derived from {{wp|Plato}}'s dialogue {{wp|Critias (dialogue)|Critias}}.
