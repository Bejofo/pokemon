'''Ponyta''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ポニータ''' ''Ponyta'') is a {{type|Fire}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s into {{p|Rapidash}} starting at [[level]] 40.

In [[Galar]], Ponyta has a {{type|Psychic}} [[regional form]]. It evolves into Galarian Rapidash starting at [[level]] 40.

==Biology==
Ponyta is an {{wp|horse|equine}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with cream-colored fur that resembles a foal/filly. It has brown eyes and triangular ears with reddish interiors. Yellow and reddish-orange flames make up its mane and tail. The mane forms a short crest on top of its head and a short strip down its back to its tail. Additional flames are present behind its elbows and knees. The fire appears about an hour after hatching. It has four long legs, each ending in a single, gray hoof. These hooves are said to be ten times harder than diamonds and act as shock absorbers.

Ponyta are relatively lightweight for their size, as they have extraordinary jumping abilities and are capable of leaping tall buildings in a single bound. However, a newborn Ponyta is a weak runner and is actually barely able to stand. It gradually strengthens its legs and becomes faster by chasing after its parents and jumping over grass that grows taller by the day. In the ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' episode ''[[EP033|The Flame Pokémon-athon!]]'', it is shown that Ponyta can control its flames so that its rider is not burned by them, and Ponyta only does this for those that it has accepted. Ponyta herds tend to live in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|grasslands}}, plains, mountains, or anywhere that they can run freely.

===Forms===
Ponyta has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Galarian}} Ponyta.

Ponyta has adapted in the forests of the [[Galar]] region, after generations of being exposed to the life energy found within.<ref name=SwShsite/> Galarian Ponyta has chalk-white fur covering most of its body. Instead of flames, its mane, tail and fetlocks are covered in a long, purple-and-blue, fluffy fur. Its eyes are purple with light-blue irises, and it has a small purple-and-white horn on top of its forehead.

Galarian Ponyta can absorb the life energy located in the atmosphere and store it in its mane, which will then become more colorful and potentially release a shining glow if there is a lot of energy to use.<ref name=SwShsite>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon-galar-region/ponyta/ Galarian Ponyta | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref> Galarian Ponyta's horn has healing powers; it can heal any slight wound with a few rubs from its horn. By looking into the eyes of a person, Galarian Ponyta can read the contents of their heart. Should it find any evil, it will promptly go into hiding. As shown in the {{aniseries|JN}} episode ''[[JN055|The Tale of You and Glimwood Tangle!]]'', Galarian Ponyta can send pleas for help in the form of visions to people, even if they're from another region.

Galarian Ponyta and its Evolution are the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Pastel Veil}} as an [[Ability]].

==Trivia==
* In August 2007, employees of [[Game Freak]] put {{DL|List of GTS event Pokémon distributions|Psyduck|several Japanese Psyduck}} up on the [[Global Terminal|Global Trade Station]] for an American Ponyta.
* Ponyta is one of the fourteen Pokémon the player can collect [[foreign Pokédex entries]] for in {{game|Diamond and Pearl|s}}.
* Ponyta's Stadium and FireRed [[Pokédex entry|Pokédex entries]] state that it can jump over the {{wp|Eiffel Tower}} and {{wp|Uluru|Ayers Rock}}, which exist in the [[Pokémon world in relation to the real world#Real-world locations mentioned|real world]]. {{wp|Tokyo Tower}} is referenced in Red and Green, as well as the Japanese versions of Stadium and FireRed.
* Galarian Ponyta's {{pkmn|category}}, Unique Horn, sounds similar to "unicorn".

===Origin===
Ponyta and its evolved form may be based on fiery steeds in mythology, such as those belonging to the Greek god {{wp|Helios}}, {{wp|Skinfaxi and Hrímfaxi|Skinfaxi}} of {{wp|Norse mythology}}, or the horses of the {{wp|Ashvins}} in {{wp|Hindu mythology}}. It may also be based on {{wp|Qilin}}, a legendary Chinese hooved chimerical creature sometimes depicted with parts of their bodies on fire. The fire in its {{Shiny}} coloration refers to blue {{wp|fire}}, which generally indicates a higher temperature than orange fire but may also be caused by certain chemicals burning at a normal temperature.

Galarian Ponyta may be based on a {{wp|Shetland pony}} and modern depictions of a {{wp|unicorn}}. The unicorn is the national animal of {{wp|Scotland}}, which is the inspiration for the [[Crown Tundra]], as well as being part of the {{wp|United Kingdom}}, the country that [[Galar]] is based on. Its signature Ability, {{a|Pastel Veil}}, may be inspired by the belief that unicorn horns can be used to cure diseases and neutralize poisons.

====Name origin====
Ponyta may be a combination of ''{{wp|pony}}'' and ''bonita'' (''pretty'' in various Iberian languages).
