'''Melmetal''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''メルメタル''' ''Melmetal'') is a {{type|Steel}} [[Mythical Pokémon]] introduced during [[Generation VII]]. It first appeared in {{g|GO}} and later made its [[core series]] debut in {{LGPE}}.

In [[Pokémon GO]], it [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Meltan}} by using 400 Meltan {{OBP|Candy|GO}}. Meltan cannot evolve in the core series games.

Melmetal has a [[Gigantamax]] form, which debuted with the release of Pokémon GO [[transfer]] compatibility with {{g|HOME}}. It can Gigantamax into '''Gigantamax Melmetal''' if it has the {{DL|Gigantamax|Gigantamax Factor}}.

It was officially revealed on October 24, 2018.

==Biology==
[[File:Melmetal LGPE Concept Art.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Melmetal is made up of several metallic nuts that it can move individually]]
Melmetal is a large, silver {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a vaguely humanoid build that consists mostly of liquid metal. Many dark-gray {{wp|Nut (hardware)|hexagonal nuts}} are embedded in or attached to its body: one around each shoulder, one around the center of each arm, one in each hand, one in each foot, and a small light gray one in the center of its torso. A large, golden hexagonal nut encircles its neck and a smaller one acts as its head. Floating in its head is a small, dark gray sphere which may be oscillated. It has a small red tail resembling an electrical wire.

According to [[Professor Willow]], Melmetal lived in a secluded area deep within a wooded land that was full of sedimentary rocks rich with magnetite, and its shed metal was used by ancient people to create unique metal tools. The process of [[Evolution]] has hardened its body, making it incredibly sturdy. However, it is still in a liquid state and has some flexibility, particularly in its heavy hex nut arms.<ref>[https://pokemonletsgo.pokemon.com/en-us/new-pokemon/ Pokémon Let's Go site | New Pokémon] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20220304212944/https://pokemonletsgo.pokemon.com/en-us/new-pokemon/ archived copy])</ref> Melmetal applies centrifugal force on its arms, allowing it to have the strongest punches of all Pokémon. When it attacks, the nuts encircling its arms slide down as if to bulk up its fists.<ref name=Guide>''[[Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! & Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee!: Official Trainer's Guide & Pokédex]]'', p. 362</ref> It is said to be created when one strong {{p|Meltan}} [[Pokémon fusion|absorbs]] the group it lives with in order to evolve. When it reaches the end of its life, it will rust and break down into small shards, from which new Meltan will be born. In ancient times, Melmetal was worshiped for its ability to create metal from nothing. After its death 3,000 years ago, its worshippers placed the Meltan born from it inside [[Mystery Box]]es as a way for Melmetal to return in the future.

Melmetal is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Double Iron Bash}}.

===Forms===
Melmetal has a [[Gigantamax]] form.
[[File:MelmetalVMAXPokémonGO48.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Melmetal bringing the hex nuts on its fist together to punch harder]]
As Gigantamax Melmetal, it becomes a large cyclopean giant, told in legends. The dark-gray hexagonal nuts are now embedded as five fingers for its hands, two for the feet, two underneath the shoulder, and two connecting the shoulder to a large golden nut at the center of its chest. A silver hexagonal nut is located on its abdomen, and it has a large red tail resembling an electrical wire located behind it. The head is shaped like a knight's helmet with three red clouds surrounding it. Inside is a smaller golden hexagonal nut, with a glowing red and gray sphere floating in the center of it.

In its Gigantamax state, Melmetal can use its elastic and flexible body to land punches at foes while keeping its distance. By bringing the hex nuts on its fists together, it can create gigantic fists for an even bigger punch. Gigantamax Melmetal can release tremendous electric beams from its belly, capable of vaporizing opponents and even an entire hill. The electricity is generated by the flow of liquid metal stored in Gigantamax Melmetal's body.<ref>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/expansionpass/pokemon/gigantamax-melmetal/ Gigantamax Melmetal | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20220131231737/https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/expansionpass/pokemon/gigantamax-melmetal/ archived copy])</ref>

Gigantamax Melmetal is the only known Pokémon capable of using the [[G-Max Move]] {{m|G-Max Meltdown}}.

==In animation==

===Main series===
====Major appearances====
=====[[Ash's Melmetal]]=====
Melmetal debuted in ''[[SM138|Final Rivals!]]'', after {{Ash}}'s Meltan [[Pokémon fusion|fused]] with its fellow {{OBP|Meltan|recurring}} in order to [[Evolution|evolve]] the night before the [[Manalo Conference]] finals.

====Minor appearances====

===GOTCHA!===
A Melmetal briefly appeared as a silhouette in [[GOTCHA!]].

==In the manga==

==In the TCG==
{{main|Melmetal (TCG)}}
==Trivia==
* Melmetal is the only Mythical Pokémon that learns {{M|Protect}} via level up.
* Melmetal and its pre-evolved form {{p|Meltan}} have several unique attributes:
** They are the only [[Mythical Pokémon]] to be part of an evolutionary line, and the only Mythical Pokémon that can be [[trade]]d or placed in a {{GO|Gym}} as a defender in {{g|GO}}.
** They are the only {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} in {{LGPE}} to not be introduced in [[Generation I]].
** They are the only Pokémon in Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! whose [[List of Pokémon by Kanto Pokédex number|Kanto Pokédex numbers]] (152 and 153) are not the same as their [[List of Pokémon by National Pokédex number|National Pokédex numbers]] (808 and 809). While Kanto Pokédex numbers are normally used throughout the game, the [[stats judge|judge]] screen displays National Pokédex numbers, which is evident for Meltan and Melmetal.
** They are the only Pokémon officially introduced in [[Generation VII]] that are not in any version of the [[List of Pokémon by Alola Pokédex number|Alola Pokédex]].
** They are the only Pokémon in the National Pokédex of Pokémon GO and {{g|HOME}} ([[Nintendo Switch]] only) to not be listed in a region section. Instead, they are put into "Unidentified" and "Unknown Origins" respectively.
* Melmetal is the only Mythical Pokémon to have a [[Gigantamax]] form.
** Melmetal is also the only Pokémon introduced in Generation VII to have a Gigantamax form.
** Moreover, Melmetal is the only Pokémon whose Gigantamax form cannot be obtained through the {{DL|Master Dojo|Max Soup}}.
*** Although Melmetal's {{Shiny}} form is legitimately available, its Shiny Gigantamax form is not, as the Gigantamax Melmetal distributed in Pokémon HOME is not Shiny. Melmetal is the only Pokémon with this attribute.
* Melmetal is the [[List of Pokémon by weight|heaviest]] Mythical Pokémon.
* Melmetal is coded to learn the move {{m|Thunder Punch}} upon [[Evolution|evolving]]. However, this is impossible due to Meltan being unable to evolve in the [[core series]] games.
* In Generation VII, the levels at which Meltan and Melmetal can learn moves, aside from 1, are all divisible by 9. In [[Generation VIII]], they are divisible by 8 instead.

===Origin===
Melmetal has similar design aesthetics to its pre-Evolution, Meltan. Its head and features resemble hexagonal {{wp|Nut (hardware)|nuts}}, and its tail resembles an exposed wire. Its body may be based on either {{wp|gallium}} or {{wp|Mercury (element)|mercury}}; both are metallic elements with relatively low melting points (gallium melting at 86&nbsp;°F (30&nbsp;°C) and mercury being liquid at room temperature), both can conduct electricity, and both can easily react with many other metals to form {{wp|alloy}}s and {{wp|Amalgam (chemistry)|amalgams}}.

Melmetal and its [[Gigantamax]] form may have been based on the {{wp|Cyclopes|Cyclops}}. Additionally, its Gigantamax form could be based on {{wp|Balor}}, described as a giant being with an eye that can destroy everything when opened.

====Name origin====
Melmetal may be a combination of ''melt'' and ''metal''.
