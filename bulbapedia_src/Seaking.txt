'''Seaking''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''アズマオウ''' ''Azumao'') is a {{type|Water}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s from {{p|Goldeen}} starting at [[level]] 33.

==Biology==
Seaking is a primarily orange-and-white, {{wp|fish|piscine}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. It has round, dark eyes, prominent pink lips, two small fangs, and a cream-colored horn in the center of its forehead. A female will have a smaller horn than a male. Most of its body is orange with a patch of white under its mouth and along its underside. There are several black markings on its body: two thick lines under each eye, a large wavy patch on its back, and several speckles near its tail. It has billowing {{wp|fish fin|pectoral fins}} and a pair of tail fins shaped like butterfly wings, all of which are white speckled with black. However, its {{wp|dorsal fin}} is pure white and rigid.

Seaking is a very powerful swimmer that is found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Water's-edge Pokémon|rivers and streams}}. It can swim not only against a river's current, but up waterfalls as well. In the autumn spawning season, it grows fatter and more vibrant. It travels upriver where male Seaking engage in elaborate dances to court females. The female would go for the Seaking with the most graceful dance.

Seaking uses its powerful horn to bore holes in riverbed boulders in order to shelter its {{pkmn|Egg}}s from water currents. A mated pair take turns patrolling around their new nest for roughly a month and defend it with their lives. There are two different groups of Trainers who are obsessed with Seaking's horns or dorsal fins. However, the groups cannot get along with each other. In [[Generation I]], {{m|Waterfall}} was its [[signature move]].

===Evolution===
Seaking evolves from {{p|Goldeen}}.

{{main|Seaking (TCG)}}

==Trivia==
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Seaking's prototype name was "{{wp|Neptune (mythology)|Neptune}}", after the god of the sea in Roman mythology.
* Seaking's number in the [[List of Pokémon by Sinnoh Pokédex number|Sinnoh Pokédex]] and the [[List of Pokémon by Johto Pokédex number|Johto Pokédex]] are the same: 079.
* In [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|Gold, Silver]], and [[Pokémon Crystal|Crystal]] Versions, it appears that Seaking was originally set to learn {{m|Supersonic}} as one of its three starting moves. However, the game programmers made an error and filled the third data slot with {{m|Tail Whip}}, so Seaking ended up with two starting moves instead.

===Origin===
Seaking seems to be based on the {{wp|oranda}} breed of {{wp|goldfish}} due to its plump body and billowing tail, specifically the ''azuma nishiki'' variety. It might also be inspired by the ''Sanke'' variety of {{wp|koi}} fish. Its behavior is reminiscent of the {{wp|sockeye salmon}}, whose bodies flush red as they {{wp|Salmon run|swim upstream}} and climb {{m|Waterfall|waterfalls}} during their breeding season. Its horn may be a reference to {{wp|Matsya}}, a giant horned fish that is one of the avatars assumed by the Hindu deity {{wp|Vishnu}}. Seaking's royal theme may come from the Japanese word for goldfish which is 金魚 ''Kingyo''.

====Name origin====
Seaking may be a combination of ''sea'', ''king'', and possibly a play on ''seeking''.

Azumao may be derived from 東錦 ''{{wp|Oranda#Variants|azuma nishiki}}'' (a breed of goldfish) and 王 ''ō'' (king).
