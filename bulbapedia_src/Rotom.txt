'''Rotom''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ロトム''' ''Rotom'') is a dual-type {{2t|Electric|Ghost}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation IV]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Rotom has the ability to possess the motors of certain appliances and [[#Form data|change forms]]. It also learns a new [[move]] depending on which appliance it possesses. Rotom's form can be changed in by allowing it to possess the appliances in [[Rotom's Room]] or from the [[Rotom Catalog]].

* When it has not possessed any appliance or is possessing a {{wp|Electric light|light bulb}}, it is dual-type {{2t|Electric|Ghost}}, and learns {{m|Thunder Shock}} if the move it had in its other forms is the only move it knows.
* When it possesses a {{wp|microwave oven}}, it becomes '''Heat Rotom''', is dual-type {{2t|Electric|Fire}}, and learns {{m|Overheat}}.
* When it possesses a {{wp|washing machine}}, it becomes '''Wash Rotom''', is dual-type {{2t|Electric|Water}}, and learns {{m|Hydro Pump}}.
* When it possesses a {{wp|refrigerator}}, it becomes '''Frost Rotom''', is dual-type {{2t|Electric|Ice}}, and learns {{m|Blizzard}}.
* When it possesses an {{wp|Fan (machine)|electric fan}}, it becomes '''Fan Rotom''', is dual-type {{2t|Electric|Flying}}, and learns {{m|Air Slash}}.
* When it possesses a {{wp|lawn mower}}, it becomes '''Mow Rotom''', is dual-type {{2t|Electric|Grass}}, and learns {{m|Leaf Storm}}.

In [[Generation IV]], Rotom had {{t|Ghost}} as its secondary [[type]] regardless of its form.

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Form data|Game data&rarr;Form data]] for these details.)

In [[Generation VII]], Rotom can possess a special [[Pokédex]] and become the [[Rotom Pokédex]], which has the ability to [[Talking Pokémon|speak human language]]. In [[Generation VIII]] and [[Generation IX]], Rotom can possess a smartphone that doubles as a Pokédex and become the [[Rotom Phone]]. Rotom are also used in [[Rotomi]] terminals, and [[Drone Rotom]]. The Rotom Phone can be used to power a [[Rotom Bike]].

==Biology==
Rotom is a small, orange {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that has a body of plasma. It is mostly spherical, with a bulb below its body and a long pointed protrusion on top, making it shaped like a lightning rod. There is a whitish blue aura of electricity around it that forms lightning bolt-shaped appendages. When moving quickly, these appendages tend to disappear, in favor of a long similar-looking trail of blue electricity. It has teeth, and its unique, blue eyes have a dividing line across them. In its base form, Rotom cannot be touched by anyone without the latter being shocked in the process. According to the [[Rotom Catalog]], Rotom in its base form is possessing a light bulb. Rotom lack any sort of circulatory system or pulse.<ref>[[Rotom Pokédex]], ({{g|Sun and Moon}}): "''Waaah! If I had a pulse, it would be pounding like crazzzy right now!''"</ref>

Rotom have the ability to enter and control appliances. They typically use their abilities to make mischief, often using the household items they possess to pull pranks on unsuspecting people, as seen in the ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' episode ''[[DP105|Get Your Rotom Running!]]''. Despite this, some Rotom have taken to inhabiting electronics with the intent of helping others. The [[Rotom Pokédex]], [[Rotom Phone]]s, [[Rotomi]], and [[Drone Rotom]] are some examples. Additionally, in [[Galar]], the Rotom Phone is used to power the [[Rotom Bike]]. Some of these forms allow Rotom to [[Talking Pokémon|speak human languages]], and demonstrate that Rotom are highly intelligent. Rotom tend to reside in abandoned buildings. Research continues on Rotom and its ability to power unique motors. In the ''Pokémon the Series'' episode ''[[XY081|Rotom's Wish!]]'', a specific Rotom was shown to have the ability to [[time travel]].

===Forms===
[[File:Rotom parts.png|thumb|200px|left|Rotom and the appliances]]
<div style="float:right; display:flex; flex-flow:row wrap;">
[[File:Brock and Rotom.png|thumb|220px|left|Rotom transforming]]
</div>
Rotom has five alternate forms: Heat Rotom, Wash Rotom, Frost Rotom, Fan Rotom, and Mow Rotom.

Rotom's forms can be accessed by possessing specific household appliances with a special motor, namely: a convection {{wp|microwave oven}} (Heat Rotom), a {{wp|washing machine}} (Wash Rotom), a {{wp|refrigerator}} (Frost Rotom), an {{wp|mechanical fan|electric fan}} (Fan Rotom), and a {{wp|lawn mower|lawnmower}} (Mow Rotom). When Rotom changes forms, its eyes and electric aura change colors, and its aura appendages take on different shapes: red with oven mitts as Heat Rotom, blue with clothespins as Wash Rotom, purple with lightning bolts as Frost Rotom, yellow with air curls as Fan Rotom, and green with a ripped strip as Mow Rotom.

In modern [[Sinnoh]], Rotom's forms were said to have been first discovered and documented by [[Charon]]. However, Rotom existed in [[Hisui]] and was also documented in the [[List of Pokémon by Hisui Pokédex number|Hisui Pokédex]]. The electric fan that Rotom inhabits to become Fan Rotom was invented by a boy, and was the first Rotom-related appliance to be developed, leading to the creation of many other appliances like it. The washing machine model that Rotom can inhabit has been discontinued, which caused its price to skyrocket. Heat Rotom will become lethargic if the oven it possesses is malfunctioning.

====Form change====
When Rotom changes into an appliance form, it learns a new move in the same way that other Pokémon may learn new moves upon evolving; if Rotom would change from one appliance form to another and knows the special move of its current form, the old special move is automatically forgotten and Rotom learns the new one. If Rotom changes to its base form, it forgets the special move of the form it was in (if it still knows it); if the only move that Rotom knows right before reverting to its base form is the form's special move, then that move will be replaced with {{m|Thunder Shock}}. In {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, reverting to the base form will teach it Thunder Shock even if it knows another move.

In [[Generation IV]], all forms of Rotom are {{2t|Electric|Ghost}}-type; from [[Generation V]] onward, the appliance forms replace the Ghost type with the type of their associated move. All appliance forms have the same [[base stats]], with a higher total than that of Rotom's default form; the only base stat of normal Rotom that is higher than its appliance forms is its Speed.

* In Pokémon Platinum, {{g|Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl|Brilliant Diamond, and Shining Pearl}}, the appliances are located in [[Rotom's Room]] in the [[Team Galactic Eterna Building]], which can only be accessed by using the {{si|Secret Key}}.
* In {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}}, the appliances are located in [[Rotom's Room]] in [[Silph Co.]], which can be accessed when entering the broken elevator with Rotom as the [[walking Pokémon]].
* In {{game4|BWB2W2}}, the appliances are located in boxes in the basement of [[Shopping Mall Nine]].
* In {{g|X and Y}}, the appliances are located in boxes on the second floor of the {{DL|South Boulevard|Sycamore Pokémon Lab}} in [[Lumiose City]].
* In {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, the appliances are located in boxes in [[Professor Birch]]'s lab in [[Littleroot Town]].
* In {{game4|SMUSUM}}, the appliances are located in boxes in the basement of [[Professor Kukui]]'s lab in [[Alola Route 1|Hau'oli Outskirts]].
* In {{g|Sword and Shield|Sword, Shield}}, {{g|Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl|Brilliant Diamond, Shining Pearl}}, and {{g|Scarlet and Violet|Scarlet, and Violet}}, the [[Rotom Catalog]] appears as a [[Key Item]] that allows the player to change Rotom's form at will wherever they are. In Sword and Shield, it can be obtained in a house in [[Wyndon]] from a {{tc|League Staff}} member after defeating him in {{pkmn|battle}}. In Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, the Rotom Catalog is automatically obtained after letting Rotom enter an appliance in Rotom's Room. Rotom must have been in a form at least once to unlock that form in the Rotom Catalog. In Scarlet and Violet, it can be purchased from an auction in the [[Porto Marinada Market]] if the player owns a Rotom.
* In {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, an appliance may sometimes be sold by [[Ginter]] of the [[Ginkgo Guild]]; after being purchased, it is placed in the [[player's house|player's quarters]] in [[Jubilife Village#Your Quarters|Jubilife Village]].

Using these locations, Rotom can also return the appliance to change back to its default form. In Generation IV, Rotom changes back to its default form when taken into the [[Union Room]] or [[Wi-Fi Club]], or when deposited in the [[Pokémon Day Care]].

[[Pokémon Egg|Hatched]] Rotom will always be in their standard form.

Upon changing into an appliance form, Rotom will learn the special move associated with the form, and upon changing from an appliance form, it will forget that special move. When changing forms, if Rotom knows four moves but not the special move of its previous form, the player will be prompted to replace a move with the new exclusive move (Rotom cannot change to an appliance form unless it does). If Rotom's only known move is its special move and it changes to its default form, then the Rotom will learn {{m|Thunder Shock}}. If Rotom forgets the move that is tied to its appliance form, it remains in its appliance form.

Rotom's appliance forms first appeared as silhouettes in August 2008, shortly before the Japanese release of {{game|Platinum}}, with a statement that indicated that these Pokémon would be in the game. Days before the game's release, it was revealed that these Pokémon were the alternate forms of Rotom. These new forms made their debut in Pokémon Platinum, and have been included in every [[core series]] game since.

In Generation IV, there are five separate appliances and changing Rotom's form temporarily removes that appliance from the room, so the player can never have more than one of each form. From Generation V onward, this limitation is removed. In [[Hisui]], five separate appliances are again depicted, but changing Rotom's form does not remove that appliance from the room.

Rotom's appliance forms are not present in [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness|Explorers of Time, Darkness]] and [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky|Sky]]. In {{g|Super Mystery Dungeon}}, they are a permanent form difference, with each form being a separate Pokémon on the [[Connection Orb]].

==Trivia==
[[File:Rotom Pokédex type.png|thumb|250px|The [[Rotom Pokédex]]'s type in the {{pkmn|animated series}}]]
* In {{game|Diamond and Pearl|s|Pokémon Diamond, Pearl}}, {{v2|Platinum}}, {{pkmn|Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl|Brilliant Diamond, and Shining Pearl}}, Rotom uses [[Pokémon Diamond & Pokémon Pearl: Super Music Collection|Battle! (Legendary Pokémon)]] as its battle theme, even though Rotom is not a [[Legendary Pokémon]]. To date, Rotom is the only Pokémon with this trait.
* Rotom's alternate forms, along with {{p|Arceus}}'s forms, were the only alternative forms of a Pokémon not featured in {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky}}. However, despite being introduced a year before the game was released like Rotom, {{p|Shaymin}} and {{p|Giratina}}'s alternate forms made an appearance in the game.
* Rotom is tied with {{p|Tynamo}} as the [[List of Pokémon by weight|lightest]] {{type|Electric}} Pokémon.
* Rotom was the first Pokémon mentioned to have an {{DL|List of Pokémon by gender ratio|unknown gender}} in the {{pkmn|animated series}}.
* In ''[[JN037|That New Old Gang of Mine!]]'', {{Ash}}'s [[Rotom Phone]] listed the {{an|Rotom Pokédex}} as a pure Electric-type.
* In {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, Rotom's formes can't master their exclusive moves, even with a [[Seed of Mastery]].

====Generation V type change====
* Rotom is the only Pokémon to have its type changed to a type that was not newly introduced.
* No other Pokémon has the same [[type]] [[List of Pokémon with unique type combinations|combination]] as Rotom's base form or Heat Rotom, making Rotom the only Pokémon with more than one unique type combination.
* Despite becoming part {{type|Flying}}, Fan Rotom retains the [[Ability]] {{a|Levitate}}, being the only Flying-type Pokémon with this Ability. As its Flying type already makes it immune to {{type|Ground}} [[move]]s, its Ability is effectively useless under normal conditions.
** In [[Inverse Battle]]s, Fan Rotom is still protected from Ground-type moves due to Levitate, making it the only Flying-type Pokémon to not be affected by Ground-type moves in these battles by default.
* All of Rotom's appliance forms (except Mow Rotom) are tied for or have the fewest weaknesses of all Pokémon of their secondary types.
** All of Rotom's alternate forms (except Mow Rotom) are also the lightest Pokémon of their secondary typing.
* Heat Rotom is tied with {{form|Castform|Sunny Form}} {{p|Castform}}, {{p|Litwick}}, and {{p|Scorbunny}} for the [[List of Pokémon by height|shortest]] {{type|Fire}} Pokémon.
* Frost Rotom is:
** tied with {{form|Castform|Snowy Form}} {{p|Castform}} and {{p|Snom}} for the shortest {{type|Ice}} Pokémon,
** the only {{type|Ice}} Pokémon in the {{egg3|Amorphous}},
** one of the only Ice Pokémon, the other ones being Snom and {{p|Chien-Pao}}, to not be able to learn {{m|Ice Beam}}.

===Origin===
Rotom appears to be based on {{wp|poltergeist}}s or {{wp|tsukumogami}}, a type of ghost that possesses household items. Many of its Pokédex entries are reminiscent of {{wp|gremlin}}s. Its Pokédex entry from [[Pokémon Legends: Arceus]] specifically calls it a "{{wp|will-o'-the-wisp}} powered by electricity"; will-o'-the-wisps are typically ghost-like lights that inhabit marshes. Usually will-o'-the-wisps appear as balls of fire, another form of plasma. Rotom may also be an embodiment of {{wp|ball lightning}} or electronic "{{wp|magic smoke}}".

Additionally, Rotom appears to be [[List of references to Pulseman|based on]] {{wp|Pulseman}}, who was designed by Pokémon designer [[Ken Sugimori]].

Each of Rotom's forms appears as an electronic object with arms made out of electric sparks. Its regular form seems to be based on a {{wp|Electric light|light bulb}}, Heat Rotom possesses an {{wp|oven}}, Wash Rotom a {{wp|washing machine}}, Frost Rotom a {{wp|refrigerator}}, Fan Rotom a {{wp|Fan (machine)|fan}}, and Mow Rotom a {{wp|lawn mower|lawnmower}}.

====Name origin====
Rotom is derived from ''motor'' spelled backwards.

In {{game|Platinum}}, an old notebook in [[Rotom's Room]] describes how a person discovered and named the first known Rotom. It appeared out of a lawn mower's motor, and the person named it Rotom due to this origin.
