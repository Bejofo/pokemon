'''Silvally''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''シルヴァディ''' ''Silvady'') is a {{type|Normal}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation VII]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Type: Null}} when [[friendship Evolution|leveled up with high friendship]].

Silvally's {{a|RKS System}} allows it to change [[#Form data|forms]] and [[type]] when it holds a [[memory]].

It is associated with the [[Ultra Beast]]s.

==Biology==
[[File:Silvally SM concept art.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Silvally's chimeric anatomy]]
Silvally is a quadrupedal, chimeric {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with traits from a variety of creatures, with an appearance nearly identical to its pre-Evolution, {{p|Type: Null}}. It has a mammalian head with mechanical parts. Covering most of its head and neck is a thick, silver mane that extends down over its chest. Its blunt snout is metallic on the bridge of its nose and upper jaw. Silvally has a triangular black nose framed by three red lines, pointed ears with bright pink and black insides, one visible fang on each side of its lower jaw, and a slight overbite. Its eyes are bright silver, have no visible pupils, and appear to be surrounded by an empty, black space. On each side of its head is a circular, metallic {{wp|Optical disc drive|drive}}, with a white circle crossed by a metal line. On top of its head is a large, axe-like fur or feather crest. The tip of the crest has a hooked, metallic piece, while the back has three white feathers. Silvally's lower body is mostly covered in short, black fur. The lower half of each front leg is insectoid and green with spikes along the back, while the rear legs have thick purple scales on the flanks, shins, and the top of the foot. All four of its feet have three toes, but in the front two toes face forward and one backward. Additionally, the hind paws have a short, gray claw on the back of the ankle. Its fishlike tail consists of two dark blue spines with a white fin stretched between them. The top spine has a line of short, gray spikes.

Once Type: Null finds a trusted partner and forms a powerful bond with them, it gains the strength and willpower needed to destroy its control mask and finally [[Evolution|evolve]] into its original form, Silvally. After its Evolution, it reactivates its {{a|RKS System}}, gaining the ability to change its [[type]] through the [[Memory|Memories]] created by the [[Aether Foundation]]; this ability was based on {{a|Multitype|the powers}} of {{p|Arceus|a certain Pokémon depicted in myths}}. Additionally, Silvally's speed and senses are increased due to Evolution. It was created as part of the [[beast killer project]] as an "Anti-[[Ultra Beast|UB]] Fighting life-form", however, the project was deemed a failure and a control helmet was built to seal away its power, [[Devolution|turning it]] into Type: Null. It reverts back to its natural, wild temperament, but it is still extremely loyal to its {{pkmn|Trainer}}, and it will even risk its own life in its partner's defense<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180510222314mp_/https://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/silvally/ Silvally page on the Pokémon Sun and Moon site (Archived)]</ref>. [[Gladion]] was the one who coined Silvally’s name, but when it was created, it was named as "Type: Full" due to its ability to change between all types. Being created to hunt down [[Ultra Beast]]s, as seen in {{aniseries|SM}} and [[Pokémon Adventures]], Silvally can feel the appearance of Ultra Beasts and the opening of [[Ultra Wormhole]]s. 

Silvally is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Multi-Attack}}. Additionally, Silvally is the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|RKS System}} as an [[Ability]].

===Forms===
Silvally has eighteen different forms, one for each [[type]].

Thanks to its {{a|RKS System}}, Silvally is capable of changing its form and [[type]] according to the [[memory]] attached to it; its eyes, spikes, drives, and fin membrane all change color to match its current type.

===Form data===
Silvally has multiple different forms that it switches between with its [[Ability]] {{a|RKS System}}, with each of its forms having a different [[type]]. In total, it has eighteen different forms, one for each type. By default, Silvally is in its {{type|Normal}} form. If it [[held item|holds]] a [[memory]], it changes its form to be the same type as the type the memory corresponds to. In [[Generation VII]], Silvally can only learn {{m|Draco Meteor}} while in its {{type|Dragon}} form; however, in [[Generation VIII]], it can learn Draco Meteor regardless of its form.

===Pokémon Horizon===
[[Tokio]]'s Type: Null evolved into a Silvally in ''[[HOR11|To a New Horizon]]''.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Silvally (TCG)}}
==Trivia==
<!--Please do not add any trivia mentioning a possible connection to Arceus.-->
* In {{g|Sun and Moon}}, Silvally has a base [[experience]] yield of 114.
* Silvally's stat distribution is identical to its pre-[[Evolution]], with the exception of its [[Stat#Speed|Speed stat]] rising to match its other stats.
** The change in its Speed stat to 95 from 59 is a reversal of the digits.
** This change to only its Speed stat makes Silvally's Evolution from Type: Null to experience the least changes to individual base stats of all Evolutions.
* In {{g|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon}} and {{g|Sword and Shield}}, Silvally is programmed to be able to be taught all three {{DL|Move variation|Pledge moves}} ({{m|Grass Pledge}}, {{m|Fire Pledge}}, and {{m|Water Pledge}}). However, due to a coding error, the [[Move Tutor]] will only offer to teach it Grass Pledge, making the latter two unable to be learned legitimately.

===Origin===
Silvally, like its pre-evolved form, seems to be based on a {{wp|Chimera (mythology)|chimera}}, a hybrid composed of different animal parts, or more specifically a {{wp|Griffin}} due to the wing-like crest on its head. Its concept also bears resemblance to {{p|Arceus}}, which can also change [[type]] and appearance based on the [[held item]]. Like its pre-Evolution, it also appears to be based on {{wp|Frankenstein's monster}} due to the bolt-like objects on its face and it being created from cells of different {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} types.

====Name origin====
<!--Do NOT add anything about Silicon Valley being a possible origin-->
Silvally may be a combination of ''silver'' and ''ally''.

Silvady may be a combination of ''silver'' and ''buddy''.

Silvally's [[Pokédex]] entry in [[Pokémon Sun and Moon|Pokémon Moon]] says that its name was given by the boy who [[Evolution|evolved]] it, most likely [[Gladion]]. Silvally being Gladion's partner explains the presence of ally in its name.
