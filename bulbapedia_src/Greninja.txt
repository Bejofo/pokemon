'''Greninja''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ゲッコウガ''' ''Gekkouga'') is a dual-type {{2t|Water|Dark}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation VI]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Frogadier}} starting at [[level]] 36. It is the final form of {{p|Froakie}}.

Greninja with the [[Ability]] {{a|Battle Bond}} are treated internally as a [[#Form data|distinct form]]. Battle Bond activates upon defeating an opponent: in [[Generation VII]], it allows Greninja to change into a special form known as '''Ash-Greninja'''; however, following the removal of Ash-Greninja in [[Generation IX]], it was reworked to instead increase Greninja's [[stat]]s.

Greninja will be able to [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Greninja''' using the [[Greninjite]] in the upcoming game {{g|Legends: Z-A}}.

(Refer to [[#Form data|Game data&rarr;Form data]] for more details.)

==Biology==
Greninja is a bipedal, {{wp|frog}}-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. It is mostly dark blue with a yellow chest and abdomen, a white triangular marking over each eye, a light blue four-pointed star on each thigh, and yellow on the lower half of its face. It has red eyes with white pupils and its mouth is hidden behind a large, pink tongue that wraps around its neck and extends outward behind its head. Running down the middle of its head is a fin-like extension, and there is a similar fin on each side of its head. Light blue webbing connects its head fins. There is a large, white bubble-like bump on each elbow and knee. Its back feet have two toes, while its front feet have three toes. Each digit has a bulbous tip and yellow webbing.

Greninja's movements are swift, rapid, and graceful, akin to those of ninja.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160224014849/http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/pokemon/starters/ Starter Pokémon (Archived)]</ref> It uses this speed to confound enemies while slicing them up. It can compress water into various weapons to slice up enemies, most commonly in the form of {{m|Water Shuriken|water shurikens}}, though it has been shown creating water katana and water kunai in both the {{pkmn|animated series}} and the [[Super Smash Bros. series|Super Smash Bros.]] video game series. It can also create shuriken from the mucus it excretes from its thighs for sharp projectiles that can split through metal. As seen in the animated series, Greninja's tongue is extremely long and many times its own height, and strong enough to catch and hold an average human. However, it usually keeps its tongue wrapped around its neck like a scarf. Doing so exposes its tongue to air movements, allowing Greninja to detect enemies it otherwise could not see.

In [[Generation VI]], {{m|Mat Block}} was its [[signature move]]. In [[Generation IX]], {{m|Water Shuriken}} is its signature move.

===Forms===
Greninja has two alternate forms: Ash-Greninja and Mega Greninja.

;Ash-Greninja
[[File:Ash Greninja SM concept art.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Concept art of Ash-Greninja from Pokémon Sun and Moon]]
As Ash-Greninja, its appearance has changed in order to more closely resemble {{Ash}}, specifically in his {{aniseries|XY}} outfit. Its skin is now a lighter shade of blue, and the yellow on its chest and abdomen has been reduced to a much smaller area. The fin-like extension on top of its head and the area between its eyes have turned red. The outer part of its side fins has turned black, as well as its cheeks, which now also puff out, resembling tufts of hair with a small, thunderbolt-shaped red streak. It now has a four-pointed star mark on its back as well, from where it creates large water shurikens. Unlike regular Greninja, Ash-Greninja is most commonly seen standing up and is always male.

Through an occurrence called the [[Bond Phenomenon]], brought on by the bonds between people and Pokémon, certain Greninja, such as [[Ash's Greninja]] in {{aniseries|PTS}}, can tap into an almost miraculous source of power in battles where they need to break their limits. Ash-Greninja's legs have strengthened, increasing its speed to a point where it moves so quickly that it becomes difficult to see and enabling it to dispatch opponents in a flash.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20171023143056mp_/http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/ash-greninja/ Ash-Greninja – Pokémon Sun and Moon (Archived)]</ref> As seen in the {{pkmn|animated series}}, the large water shuriken on its back is the symbol of a perfect transformation; before this state is reached, Ash-Greninja is covered in a turbulent veil of water.

Ash-Greninja is the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Battle Bond}} as an [[Ability]].

As of [[Generation IX]], due to Battle Bond being reworked, Greninja can no longer transform into Ash-Greninja.

;Mega Greninja
[[File:Mega Greninja large Water Shuriken.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Mega Greninja using its giant Water Shuriken]]
As Mega Greninja, its body is now mostly black, except for its lower legs, upper arms, and hands, which retain the same color, making it appear as though it is wearing a ninja outfit. The fins on either side of its head have extended outward and turned light blue, resembling shuriken with one edge much longer than the others. The four-pointed star marks it had on its thighs have been replaced by actual water shurikens. Mega Greninja clings upside down to a giant, floating, and quickly spinning six-pointed water shuriken it created from a gelatinous membrane secreted from its body.

[[Mega Evolution]] has significantly enhanced Mega Greninja's reflexes; as a result, it has forgone stealth, showcasing the confidence it has on its capabilities. By intentionally revealing itself, it provokes opponents into attacking, and its sharp reflexes enable it to both react accordingly and strike first. The mere sight of Mega Greninja clinging to its giant water shuriken is able to distract opponents, allowing it to preemptively render them unable to attack by binding them with its long tongue. Once its opponents are immobilized, Mega Greninja charges at them to strike with its massive shuriken.<ref>

====Ash-Greninja====
In the [[S19|''XY&Z'' arc]] of {{aniseries|XY}}, [[Ash's Greninja]] gained the ability to transform into a stronger form known as "Ash-Greninja" through an occurrence referred to as the [[Bond Phenomenon]]. This form was introduced to the [[core series]] games in {{g|Sun and Moon}}.

In the [[Generation VII]] games, a Greninja with the Ability {{a|Battle Bond}} will transform into Ash-Greninja after it directly causes an opponent to [[fainting|faint]] without ending the battle. It will remain in this form until either it faints or the battle ends; in the former case, this prevents it from changing back into Ash-Greninja for the remainder of the battle. Ash-Greninja has different [[base stats]] than regular Greninja, with increased {{stat|Attack}}, {{stat|Special Attack}}, and {{stat|Speed}}. Additionally, the [[move]] {{m|Water Shuriken}} will be more [[power]]ful, having 20 power instead of 15, and will always hit 3 times, instead of varying between 2-5 hits. Ash-Greninja is not possible to obtain in the core series as of {{g|Scarlet and Violet|s}} due to Battle Bond having its effect changed.

Internally, standard Greninja with Battle Bond are considered to be a separate form to Greninja with {{a|Torrent}} or {{a|Protean}}. These Greninja are always [[gender|male]], cannot {{pkmn|breeding|breed}}, and, like [[Special Pokémon]], are banned from the [[Battle Spot]]. A Greninja with Battle Bond can be transferred to Pokémon Sun and Moon from the [[Pokémon Sun and Pokémon Moon Special Demo Version|Special Demo Version]]. This is the only way to obtain it, so it is no longer obtainable for players who did not download the demo before the discontinuation of the 3DS Nintendo eShop on March 27, 2023.

==Trivia==
* Greninja is the only fully evolved form of a [[first partner Pokémon]] that has an {{pkmn2|event}}-exclusive Ability.
* Greninja and its pre-Evolutions are the only Water-type first partner Pokémon line to be exclusive to the Water 1 Egg Group.
* Greninja shares its {{pkmn|category}} with {{p|Ninjask}}. They are both known as the Ninja Pokémon.
* Greninja won first place in the Japanese [http://www.pokemon-movie.jp/election/ Pokémon general election 720] (Japanese: '''ポケモン総選挙720''') poll to decide what Pokémon would be distributed at showings of ''[[M19|Volcanion and the Mechanical Marvel]]'' in Japan.
* It was revealed that Greninja was added into [[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U]] before [[Pokémon X and Y]] was even released. Masahiro Sakurai knew that a [[Generation VI]] Pokémon was going to be a playable fighter in that game, so when Greninja was decided, all they had to go on in terms of design was concept art, similar to {{few|Roy}} during the development of [[Super Smash Bros. Melee]].
* In the [[Pokémon of the Year]] vote held by [[The Pokémon Company International]] and {{wp|Google}} in February 2020, Greninja won first place with 140,559 votes and beat {{p|Lucario}} at second place (102,259 votes) and {{p|Mimikyu}} at third (99,077 votes).
* Greninja is the only Pokémon playable in [[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]] that is unavailable in a [[Generation VIII]] [[core series]] game.
** Greninja's appearance in Ultimate was its only appearance in a [[Nintendo Switch]] game until [[Pokémon UNITE]]'s release in 2021.
* Ash-Greninja is the only Pokémon to have no viewable [[Pokédex entry|Pokédex entries]] in {{g|HOME}}'s {{OBP|Pokédex|HOME}}.
** Because all forms prior to [[Generation VII]] shared entries with their original appearance, and due to Greninja not being in any regional Pokédex at all, Ash-Greninja is the only Pokémon to not have a Pokédex entry in any capacity.
* Greninja is the only Pokémon capable of Mega Evolution to already have another alternate form that isn't a [[Gigantamax]] or [[regional form]], that being Ash-Greninja. 
* Mega Greninja, Mega {{p|Chesnaught}}, and Mega {{p|Delphox}} were the last Mega Evolutions revealed before the release of {{g|Legends Z-A}}, along with Mega {{p|Raichu}} X and Mega Raichu Y.

===Origin===
Greninja's overall appearance is based on a frog,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141007232727/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/55933/features/interview-game-freak-on-the-origins-of-pokmon-x-y/ Official Nintendo Magazine - Interview: Game Freak on the origins of Pokémon X & Y (Archived)]</ref> and it may have been inspired by horned frogs from the {{wp|Genus|genera}} ''{{wp|Megophrys}}'' and ''{{wp|Ceratophrys}}'' due to the spiked protrusions above its eyes. Its color scheme and body shape is similar to that of the {{wp|splendid leaf frog}}. The bubble-like protrusions on its body may be based on a toad's {{wp|parotoid gland}}s, possibly referencing the traditional myth of {{wp|True toad|toads}} causing {{wp|wart}}s, though they may also be remnants of Froakie and Frogadier's frubbles.

As its species name implies, Greninja is also based on a {{wp|ninja}}. Japanese culture associates frogs and toads with ninjas based on the folk story ''The Tale of the Gallant {{wp|Jiraiya}}'' (Japanese: 児雷也豪傑物語 ''Jiraiya Gōketsu Monogatari''), about a ninja who can shapeshift into a large toad. Greninja and its pre-Evolutions may also draw inspiration from the thief or rogue {{wp|character class}} in {{wp|role-playing game}}s, which are generally ranged combatants that often rely on speed and stealth, focusing more on dodging attacks rather than withstanding damage.

Ash-Greninja's appearance is based on {{Ash}}'s attire in {{aniseries|XY}} and his hair. On its back it wears a {{wp|shuriken}} (ninja star) made out of water.

Mega Greninja's black coloring may be based on the archetypal ninja outfit. Its habit of standing underneath a large water shuriken may draw from the ninja's supposed ability to impossibly walk and hang from surfaces, such as ceilings. It is also reminiscent of a frog on a {{wp|Nymphaeaceae|lily pad}}. Its large water shuriken may also be a reference to Ash-Greninja's giant Water Shuriken in the anime.

====Name origin====
Greninja may be a combination of ''grenouille'' (French for frog) and ''ninja''.

Gekkouga may be a combination of げこっ ''geko'' (croak) or 月光 ''gekkō'' (moonlight, in reference to a popular conception of ninja running through the night or to Greninja's Dark typing) and 甲賀流 ''{{wp|Kōga-ryū}}''.
