'''Reshiram''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''レシラム''' ''Reshiram'') is a dual-type {{2t|Dragon|Fire}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation V]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

Reshiram is the [[game mascot]] of [[Pokémon Black and White Versions|Pokémon Black]], appearing on the boxart.

Reshiram, {{p|Zekrom}}, and {{p|Kyurem}} are often collectively referred to as the [[Tao trio]] by fans. The group is referred to in the [[Myths and legends involving Legendary and Mythical Pokémon|myths and legends]] of the [[Unova]] region.

Reshiram can [[Pokémon fusion|absofuse]] with {{p|Kyurem}} using the [[DNA Splicers]] to become [[Kyurem (Pokémon)#Form data|White Kyurem]].

==Biology==
[[File:643Reshiram-Activated.png|thumb|left|200px|Reshiram in its {{form|Reshiram, Zekrom, and Kyurem|Overdrive mode}}]]
Reshiram is a white, bipedal {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with draconic, avian, and mammalian traits. A long, voluminous wispy mane streams out from the upper side of the snout and outwards from its head. The top of this mane is adorned with two protrusions resembling ears. Reshiram's face is fringed with spiky features, and it has a small, pointed extension below the chin. Its eyes have blue irises and black pupils. There are two pairs of pointed teeth visible when its mouth is open, one in the upper jaw and one in the lower. Reshiram has a long and slender neck, with a fluffy, collar-like protrusion jutting out of two gray, glass-like neckbands. Its arms begin slender and arm-like but then flare into a more wing-like appearance, sporting four claws resembling hands on the leading edge. There are plates at the back of Reshiram's "hands" that sport a similar color to its neck rings. Reshiram has a feathered or furry feature on its chest, with the lower portion protruding outwards to a point. Long feather-like protrusions jut out of its thighs. On its feet are large gray claws, three at the front and one positioned at the back, resembling high heels. Reshiram's tail is a mass of plume and ribbon-like extensions, surrounded by two large bands, similar to the ones around its neck. When its emotions surge, it enters {{form|Reshiram, Zekrom, and Kyurem|Overdrive mode}}, and its tail lights up with a fiery glow.
[[File:Light Stone Evolutions.png|220px|thumb|right|Reshiram’s dormant form, the [[Light Stone]]]]
Reshiram has a jet engine-like tail, which it uses to accelerate itself when flying at high speeds. It can send flames from its tail into the air to incinerate everything around it. By flaring its tail, Reshiram can move the world's atmosphere and change the weather. This tail generator is also activated when influenced by either {{p|Zekrom}}'s [[signature move]]s, which in turn powers up Reshiram's. Reshiram loves [[Reshiram Treat]]s made by [[Snacksworth]], who once encountered it in the past.

In [[Unova]]n mythology, Reshiram was created from [[List of disputed and unidentified Pokémon#Original Dragon|a single Dragon Pokémon]] owned by the [[Heroes of Truth and Ideals|twin heroes]] when it split into two: Reshiram and Zekrom. It sided with the older brother who sought the truth; as a result, it firmly believes in truth. Reshiram is said to be Zekrom's equal in battle, meaning neither of the two dragons can truly defeat the other. It is powerful enough to destroy the Unova [[region]] with its {{m|Blue Flare|intense, enveloping flames}}. Reshiram will transform into the [[Light Stone]] should its body get destroyed or when attacked by {{p|Kyurem}}'s tendril-like appendages. It can willingly transform back from said stone when awakened by a hero who believes in truth. According to one myth, Reshiram was said to burn down kingdoms of people who ignore truth due to being consumed by greed.

Reshiram is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Blue Flare}} by leveling up. Additionally, Reshiram and {{form|Kyurem|White}} {{p|Kyurem}} are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move {{m|Fusion Flare}} by leveling up. Reshiram and White Kyurem are also the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Turboblaze}} as an [[Ability]].

==Trivia==
[[File:Reshiram and Zekrom units 2010.png|thumb|200px|Reshiram and Zekrom at Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in 2010]]
[[File:Reshiram Yellow Battle Chess.png|thumb|Reshiram in Pokémon Battle Chess]]
*In games prior to {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, Reshiram has a catch rate of 45. This is likely due to Reshiram being a required capture during the storyline of {{game|Black and White|s}}.
*Reshiram was first revealed simultaneously alongside {{p|Zekrom}} on both the official English and Japanese Pokémon websites on May 28, 2010. This makes them the first two Pokémon simultaneously revealed worldwide.
*Reshiram, as well as Zekrom, made an appearance alongside {{p|Pikachu}} and a {{i|Poké Ball}} in 2010's {{wp|Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade}}.
*Reshiram appears in {{DL|Pokémon Battle Chess|Pokémon Battle Chess BW Version}}. Alongside Zekrom, the player must lose a specific number of pieces (four in Reshiram's case) to use it, and it takes four spaces on the board.
*The initial design drafts for what would become Reshiram and its counterpart Zekrom were done by [[Keiko Moritsugu]],<ref name="Moritsugu">[https://imgur.com/a/cgf0g14 Archive of deleted tweet by Keiko Moritsugu, explaining which Generation V Pokémon she had designed]</ref> while their final designs were created by [[Ken Sugimori]].<ref name="1up">''How Pokemon Get Made'', 1up.com ([https://web.archive.org/web/20130510123211/http://www.1up.com/news/how-pokemon-get-made Archive])</ref>
<!--The 1up.com article is spelled that way, without the acute e.-->
**According to Moritsugu, Zekrom's final design is mostly similar to her draft, while Reshiram's final design ended up being significantly different from her draft.<ref name="Moritsugu" />

===Origin===
Reshiram and its counterpart {{p|Zekrom}} appear to be based on the concept of {{wp|yin and yang}} in {{wp|Taoism}}, directly referenced by Reshiram's Japanese [[Pokémon category|category name]]: はくようポケモン ''White Yang Pokémon''. Reshiram's design was made to be light, airy, graceful, and feminine, to contrast Zekrom's tough and masculine design.<ref name="1up" /><ref>(February 10, 2011). [https://www.bisafans.de/spiele/editionen/schwarz-weiss/gamefreak.php Interview with Game Freak in London] by Bisafans (Page 1) (German)</ref> Its feminine design, however, contrasts the traditionally masculine characterization of yang in Taoism. Also, in both versions of the [[M14|fourteenth movie]], it speaks with a distinctly male voice. Its tail, the center point of its design, is based on an electric {{wp|turbine}},<ref name="1up" /> although in contrast to Zekrom's tail, it more closely resembles a {{wp|torch}}.

Reshiram in its Light Stone form may take inspiration from the Jewish concepts of {{wp|Urim and Thummim}} (possibly translated as “light and perfection”). In pop culture, they are commonly depicted as a white and black stone. Its association with truth would align with the idea of light.

Appearance-wise, it resembles a {{wp|wyvern}} with characteristics of other animals, such as birds, {{wp|pterosaur}}s, and canines. The crest on its head and its feathers resemble smoke trails, as well as white fire, which can burn up to temperatures of 1,500&nbsp;°C (2,730&nbsp;°F). The mythology about how Zekrom and Reshiram came about, regarding two brothers infighting, also bears some similarities to {{wp|Romulus and Remus}} or {{wp|Cain and Abel}}. There is also some resemblance to the Zoroastrian belief of two equally powerful deities, one representing light and truth, and the other representing lies and darkness. In this case, Reshiram can resemble {{wp|Ahura Mazda}}, due to its light and winged appearance, and the fact that it sided with truth, but also the fact that it is a {{type|Fire}} Pokémon, and Ahura Mazda was associated with fire. It may also draw from folkloric depictions of dragons, in that its appearance may be inspired by the {{wp|white dragon}} of England, and its association with fire may also be a reference to how dragons are associated with fire in Western folklore.

====Name origin====
Reshiram is derived from 白 ''shiro'' (white). [[Ken Sugimori]] has also stated that ''Re'' was used because it was a softer sound than {{p|Zekrom}}'s ''Ze'', as Reshiram is a less physically powerful character.<ref>[[Official Nintendo Magazine]] UK, Issue 65</ref>
