'''Electabuzz''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''エレブー''' ''Eleboo'') is an {{type|Electric}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Elekid}} starting at [[level]] 30 and evolves into {{p|Electivire}} when {{DL|Trade|Pokémon that evolve when traded|traded}} while holding an [[Electirizer]].

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for these details.)

==Biology==
Electabuzz is a slightly {{wp|humanoid}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a few {{wp|feline}} traits. It has antennae with bulbous tips where its ears should be, two long tufts of fur on top of its head, small eyes, and two large fangs in its upper jaw. It is covered in yellow fur with many black stripes. There is a large, lightning bolt-shaped stripe on Electabuzz's chest, a V-shaped stripe on its forehead, one stripe on its side, a thick stripe down its back, two bands on each leg, several broken bands on each arm, and many rings around its long tail. There are three clawed toes on each of its feet, two in front and one in back, and five fingers on each hand.

In the dark, Electabuzz will glow light blue from the electrical charges running across its body. It is constantly leaking more electricity than it consumes. Being near an Electabuzz will cause a human's hair to stand on end. Electabuzz often gathered groups around tall trees to wait for the upcoming storm. During torrential thunderstorms, Electabuzz will compete to find locations likely to be struck by lightning to absorb the electric power. Electabuzz is often used as an alternative to lightning rods because it is unharmed by the absorption of electricity. It is also capable of entirely nonverbal communication via electrical currents when near another of its species. Blackouts have been known to happen when groups of Electabuzz gather to consume electricity from power plants, they often get blamed for the occurring power outages. As a result, {{type|Ground}} Pokémon are kept around power plants to keep Electabuzz from raiding, although the blackouts are usually the fault of the electric companies, not Electabuzz. There is ongoing research on using Electabuzz to store away lightning until it is needed to be used later.

As demonstrated in the ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' episode ''[[EP042|Showdown at Dark City]]'', Electabuzz is sent into a rage by the color red. In battle, Electabuzz windmills its arms, apparently to add momentum to its punches. This method of battle seems ineffective, as opponents can escape in the meantime. Electabuzz typically resides near power plants and can cause blackouts in cities, though it can also be found in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Grassland Pokémon|grasslands}}.

===Evolution===
Electabuzz evolves from {{p|Elekid}} and evolves into {{p|Electivire}}.

==Trivia==
* In English, the {{pkmn|category}} "Electric Pokémon" is shared by {{p|Elekid}}, Electabuzz, and Kantonian {{p|Zapdos}}.
** In Japanese, Elekid has the category でんきポケモン ''Denki Pokémon'' (Electric Pokémon), while the other two Pokémon share the category でんげきポケモン ''Dengeki Pokémon'' (Electric Shock Pokémon).
* {{p|Magmar}} and Electabuzz seem to be counterparts; both evolve in a very similar way (first at level 30, then after being traded holding an item which has a name that ends with the suffix "-izer"), both have the same gender ratio (75% male, 25% female), and both are typically exclusive to one version of a pair of games. They both have similar status-inducing Abilities in Flame Body and Static, as well as the same Hidden Ability, Vital Spirit. Since Generation V, they also often learn similar moves at the same level. They even have the same special moves when purified in Pokémon XD: {{m|Follow Me}} and {{m|Cross Chop}}. Their evolutionary relatives were released in the same generation (Generation II and IV). Both also appear to be based on beings from Japanese mythology; Electabuzz has similarities to the {{wp|oni}} and Magmar has similarities to the {{wp|Karura}}.
* Electabuzz is the only member of its family not to have some physical relation to an {{wp|AC power plugs and sockets|AC power unit}}. Elekid's head is shaped like a power plug while Electivire's back pattern looks like a power socket.

===Design variations===
{{main|Pokémon controversies#Four-fingered hands|Pokémon controversies → Four-fingered hands}}
In its {{game|Red and Blue|s}} artwork, Electabuzz has four fingers; however, it is typically depicted with five fingers in its sprites and artwork, as well as in the {{pkmn|animated series}}. In its {{g|Stadium}} model, which was reused for several subsequent [[side series]] titles, namely {{g|Colosseum}}, {{g|XD: Gale of Darkness}}, and {{g|Battle Revolution}}, it is depicted with six fingers.

===Origin===
Electabuzz seems to be based on the Japanese ''{{wp|oni}}'', a horned {{wp|ogre}} that wears {{wp|tiger}} skin as clothing and sometimes has powers of thunder and lightning. Most notably, {{wp|Raijin}}, who is often depicted as an oni, is a god of lightning. Its tail resembles that of a tiger. Its horns may be based on {{wp|Tesla coil}}s.

====Name origin====
Electabuzz may be a combination of ''electric'' and ''buzz'' (possibly referring to the humming sound of electricity).

Eleboo may be a combination of ''electric'' or エレキ ''eleki'' (electric) and ブンブン ''bunbun'' (buzz).
