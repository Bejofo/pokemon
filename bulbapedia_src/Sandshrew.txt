'''Sandshrew''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''サンド''' ''Sand'') is a {{type|Ground}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolve]]s into {{p|Sandslash}} starting at [[level]] 22.

In [[Alola]], Sandshrew has a dual-type {{2t|Ice|Steel}} [[regional form]]. It evolves into Alolan Sandslash when exposed to an [[Ice Stone]]. These Sandshrew can also be found in [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]].

==Biology==
[[File:Sandshrew Camouflage.png|thumb|left|200px|Sandshrew blending in with its surroundings]]
Sandshrew is a bipedal {{wp|pholidota|pholidote}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} (though it runs on all fours in ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'')<ref>''[[EP008|The Path to the Pokémon League]]''</ref>. Its brick-patterned yellow hide is dry and tough, blends in with desert sand, and protects its soft white underbelly and muzzle. Sandshrew has blue, almond-shaped eyes, a pointed snout, and triangular ears with white insides. Its tail is thick and conical. It has two long claws on each foot and three sharp claws on its forepaws, which are used to burrow.

Sandshrew spends much of its time hidden underground in deep burrows. It only emerges to lunge and drag in passing {{type|Bug}} Pokémon. Sandshrew can quickly curl into a tight ball to protect itself from great falls and opponents but may also throw sand at attackers. While its body can efficiently absorb water to facilitate life in the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Rough-terrain Pokémon|desert}}, Sandshrew [[EP006|has been found]] in caves as well. It also lives deep underground in nests it has created from digging tunnels. Should hard rocks get in the way of digging, Sandshrew will use its sharp claws to remove them before continuing to dig. If it is too wet, its skin becomes wrinkly. It dries itself out by using the geothermal heat near a volcano. It is also known to bathe in sand, which helps remove dirt and moisture from its body.

===Forms===
[[File:Alolan Sandshrew SM concept art.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Concept artwork of {{rf|Alolan}} Sandshrew for {{g|Sun and Moon}}]]
Sandshrew has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Alolan}} Sandshrew.

In the [[Alola]] region, Sandshrew migrated to snowy mountains due to the volcanic activity near the desert areas. Its body is a light, icy blue, with a cream-colored belly and muzzle. Thicker plates form a dome around its head, and its ears resemble an {{wp|igloo}}'s entrances. Adapting to this cold climate, its body became larger and heavier, with a shell of hard ice covering its hide. The shell is also made of very hard steel.

This steel-like covering grants it extra defense from predators like {{p|Sneasel}}, but it is unable to curl into a ball like its desert counterpart; smarter predators such as {{p|Weavile}} exploit its soft underbelly. Alolan Sandshrew can burrow itself in the snow to avoid being blown away by blizzards. Its claws allow it to move without slipping on icy surfaces, but it slides on its stomach when it needs to move quickly.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20180915020424/https://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/alolan-sandshrew/ Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Alolan Sandshrew]</ref> A traditional Alolan custom during festivals is a competition to see who can slide Alolan Sandshrew across the ice the farthest. They can also be found in the [[Polar Biome]] of [[Blueberry Academy]]'s [[Terarium]], where Alola's island life is simulated.

==Trivia==
* No other Pokémon has the same [[type]] [[List of Pokémon with unique type combinations|combination]] as Alolan Sandshrew and its evolved form.
* Sandshrew and its evolved form both share their {{pkmn|category}} name with {{p|Rattata}}, {{p|Raticate}}, {{p|Pikachu}}, {{p|Raichu}}, {{p|Pawmi}}, and {{p|Pawmo}}. They are all known as the Mouse Pokémon, though Rattata and Raticate were originally called the Rat Pokémon prior to [[Generation III]].
* Alolan Sandshrew has the lowest base {{stat|Special Attack}} stat of any Pokémon, tied with {{p|Shuckle}}, {{p|Feebas}}, and {{p|Bonsly}}.
** Sandshrew has the lowest base Special Attack stat of all {{type|Ground}} Pokémon.
* Both Sandshrew and Alolan Sandshrew have {{Abilities}} that boost evasion in certain weather ({{weather|Sandstorm}} for Sandshrew and {{weather|Hail}} for Alolan Sandshrew) and Hidden Abilities that boost Speed in those same weather conditions.
* Alolan Sandshrew can be seen as a parallel to Alolan {{p|Vulpix}}. Both were initially introduced in [[Generation I]] and got [[Alolan form]]s in {{pkmn|Sun and Moon}}. Both Pokémon are {{type|Ice}}s, with Vulpix being exclusive to Sun and Sandshrew being exclusive to Moon. Furthermore, both Pokémon evolve when exposed to an [[Ice Stone]].

===Origin===
{{bulbanews|On the Origin of Species: Sandshrew and Sandslash}}
Sandshrew may be based on the {{wp|armadillo}} or {{wp|pangolin}}, mammals with hard scales and sharp claws, can curl up into a ball, and live in desert regions. Both Sandshrew and Sandslash are mentioned to have poisonous claws, similar to how some species of the {{wp|shrew}} are venomous.

Alolan Sandshrew seems to also be based on an {{wp|igloo}} and a {{wp|Curling#Curling stone|curling stone}}.

====Name origin====
Sandshrew may be a combination of ''sand'' and ''{{wp|shrew}}''.

Sand is simply ''sand''.
