'''Mimikyu''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ミミッキュ''' ''Mimikkyu'') is a dual-type {{2t|Ghost|Fairy}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation VII]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Mimikyu changes [[#Form data|forms]], from '''Disguised Form''' into '''Busted Form''', when it is hit by an attack.

==Biology==
Mimikyu is a small {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} whose body is almost entirely hidden under an old rag. Its small size makes it one of the [[List of Pokémon by height|shortest]] {{t|Ghost}} types. Its eyes are beady black through the holes in the body of its disguise however, as seen in the animated series, its eyes are actually purple. Fringe of an amorphous foot or lower body is visible under the hem as well. Occasionally, it will also extend a long, black claw-like appendage from under its rag. When angered, its eyes will glow yellow. The veil itself resembles a {{p|Pikachu}}. The cloth is yellow with black-tipped ears. The Pikachu face appears to be drawn with crayons, consisting of black eyes, red cheeks, and a squiggly black mouth. The rag's head is hollow and can be used to store objects. Mimikyu also carries a small stick resembling a lightning bolt to create a tail for its costume. When its disguise is damaged, the costume's head droops limply backward, revealing Mimikyu's ruse. Larger rips in the costume are accompanied by shadowy vapors pouring out from whatever is hidden within.

A lonely Pokémon, Mimikyu is always covered by its disguise. It is unknown what Mimikyu's true appearance looks like. However, glimpses of it are seen, such as its claw, its underside, and its eyes. Since this Pokémon is weakened by sunlight, it is rumored that the veil is used for protection. It is believed that seeing its true form will cause a mysterious illness or even a painful death. Because of this, Mimikyu will become agitated and violently stop anyone from attempting to look underneath its rag. 

Mimikyu's disguise is modeled after Pikachu because of the popularity of Pikachu-styled merchandise, thinking that its disguise would allow it to make friends with people.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160917171041/http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/mimikyu/ Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Mimikyu]</ref> It uses the disguise to bond more with humans and other Pokémon. Unfortunately, this attempt makes its disguise look more creepy. Until recent times, Mimikyu was initially thought by humans to be just a [[Ghosts in the Pokémon world|ghost]] wearing a cloth. As mentioned in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Mimikyu mimics Pikachu to the point it even sleeps similar to it. Its relationship to {{p|Pikachu}} can vary between individuals and [[canon]]s, with some being antagonistic, as seen in {{aniseries|SM}}, or can be friendly, as shown in the short, ''[[A Mimikyu Bedtime Story]]''.

A special Mimikyu in [[Alola]] acts as the [[Totem Pokémon]] for [[Acerola]]'s {{DL|Island challenge|trial}} in an [[Thrifty Megamart (Abandoned Site)|abandoned Thrifty Megamart]]. This Mimikyu possesses [[Z-Power]], an energy that originates from [[Ultra Wormhole]]s and takes the form of a golden, flaring aura. The reward for defeating Totem Mimikyu and completing the trial is a [[Ghostium Z]].

Mimikyu is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of using the [[Z-Move]] {{m|Let's Snuggle Forever}}. It is also the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Disguise}} as its [[Ability]].

Mimikyu's Pokédex data records its height without its disguise. Its height with its disguise in Disguised Form is similar to Pikachu.

===Forms===
Mimikyu has two forms: Disguised Form and Busted Form.

Mimikyu changes into its Busted Form when it is hit by an attack and its neck breaks, causing it to slump over and no longer convincingly resemble a Pikachu. Ordinarily, the rag it wears allows Mimikyu to avoid attacks. Mimikyu will attempt to keep up its disguise, even if its rag is broken. However, if its rag does get damaged or its neck gets broken, it will spend all night patching it in front of a mirror as if its life depends on it. Repairing the rag correctly is often difficult for Mimikyu, so it cries a lot on the inside. It then seeks revenge on the one that damaged it, fearing that its true identity could have been exposed. Unforgiving, Mimikyu will take down the culprit at the risk of costing its own life in the process. Mimikyu will never forget the person who damaged its rag for as long as it is still alive.

===Form data===
Mimikyu has two interchangeable forms: Disguised Form and Busted Form. It will always be in its Disguised Form outside of {{pkmn|battle}}. Mimikyu starts battles in its Disguised Form. When it is hit by a damaging [[move]], its [[Ability]] {{a|Disguise}} reduces the damage it takes from it: in [[Generation VII]], it takes no damage from it at all, and in [[Generation VIII]] onward, it nullifies the attack's damage but then loses 1/8 of its maximum {{stat|HP}}. Afterwards, its disguise slumps to the side and it changes into Busted Form. While in Busted Form, it can be damaged normally. Mimikyu will stay in Busted Form until either it [[fainted|faint]]s or the battle ends.

===Main series===
====Major appearances====
=====[[Jessie's Mimikyu]]=====
Mimikyu debuted in ''[[SM003|Loading the Dex!]]''. Though {{Ash}} tried to catch it, it decided to side with {{TRT}} instead after spotting {{AP|Pikachu}} and becoming enraged by his presence. Mimikyu was properly {{pkmn2|caught}} by [[Jessie]] in ''[[SM004|First Catch in Alola, Ketchum-Style!]]''.

=====Other=====
A {{Shiny}} Mimikyu, [[nickname]]d '''Mimikins''' (Japanese '''ミミたん''' ''Mimi-tan''), debuted in ''[[SM073|Why Not Give Me a Z-Ring Sometime?]]'', under the ownership of [[Acerola]]. Unlike regular Mimikyu, Mimikins is an actual [[Ghosts in the Pokémon world|ghost]] of a deceased Mimikyu, and thus can float in the air and pass through solid objects. It has since made further appearances in {{aniseries|SM}}.

====Minor appearances====
A {{pkmn|Trainer}}'s Mimikyu appeared in ''[[SM017|Crystal-Clear Sleuthing!]]''.

====Pokédex entries====
{{Animedexheader|Alola}}
{{Animedexbody|SM003|Mimikyu|Rotom Pokédex|Mimikyu, the Disguise Pokémon. A {{t|Ghost}} and {{t|Fairy}} type. It wears a ragged head cover to look like a Pikachu, but little is known about this Pokémon. It's said that a scholar who once tried to look inside met his end.}}

===GOTCHA!===
[[File:Mimikyu POKÉTOON.png|thumb|left|250px|Mimikyu in [[POKÉTOON]]]]
[[File:Mimikyu Ghost Dive.png|thumb|250px|Mimikyu in {{so|Ghost Dive}}]]
A Mimikyu briefly appeared in [[GOTCHA!]], under the ownership of [[Acerola]].

===POKÉTOON===
A Mimikyu appeared in ''[[PT01|Scraggy and Mimikyu]]''.

===Ghost Dive===
Mimikyu is the lead Pokémon in the music video for the song {{so|Ghost Dive}}, performed by [[Polkadot Stingray]]. Notably, it is the favorite Pokémon of vocalist Shizuku,<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20230920112732/https://twitter.com/HZshizuku/status/1704424544654831978</ref> and its cry is sampled in the arrangement of Lavender Town.

==In the manga==
[[File:Sun Penny.png|thumb|200px|Mimikyu in [[Pokémon Adventures]]]]
===Pokémon Adventures===
Mimikyu debuted in ''[[PASM16|A Photoshoot and the Abandoned Thrifty Megamart]]''. {{adv|Sun}} was tasked with taking a picture of a {{pkmn2|Totem}} Mimikyu that lived at the abandoned {{OBP|Thrifty Megamart|Abandoned Site}} in order to complete his second [[island challenge|trial]]. After befriending the Totem, Sun {{pkmn2|caught}} him and [[nickname]]d him Penny.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Mimikyu (TCG)}}

==Other appearances==
===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
[[File:SSB Mimikyu.jpeg|thumb|250px|Mimikyu in [[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]]]
Mimikyu appears as a Pokémon summoned from the {{i|Poké Ball}}, where it uses its exclusive [[Z-Move]] {{m|Let's Snuggle Forever}}<ref>[https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-video-games/super-smash-bros-ultimate Super Smash Bros. Ultimate page on Pokémon.com]</ref> on any opponent who gets too close to it. Unlike its depiction in the [[core series]] {{pkmn|games}}, Mimikyu grabs its target instead of jumping on top of it. If the target is at 90% damage or more, they will be {{sbw|instant KO|instantly KO'd}}, and Mimikyu will leave behind its disguise and presumably depart afterwards.

Mimikyu also appears as a {{sbw|Spirits (characters)|Spirit}}. If its Spirit is equipped, the fighter will start the match with Death's Scythe.

===[[Pokémon UNITE]]===
{{main|Mimikyu (UNITE)}}

==Trivia==
* Mimikyu is the only {{type|Fairy}} Pokémon [[List of Pokémon by shape#Pokémon with serpentine bodies|with a serpentine body]].
* Mimikyu was designed by [[Megumi Mizutani]].<ref>[https://www.pokemoncenter-online.com/?s=special/my151cam My151キャンペーン] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20220423234524/https://www.pokemoncenter-online.com/?s=special%2Fmy151cam archived copy]; section: イラストレーター紹介はこちら)</ref>
* On October 20, 2016, [[The Pokémon Company]] posted a Mimikyu-themed music video onto their YouTube channel titled [[Mimikyu's Song]].
* According to an official piece of merchandise, Mimikyu's height does not count the head of the disguise, only the body.<ref>[https://twitter.com/PokeshopperVGC/status/956854089907924993 @PokeshopperVGC on Twitter]</ref>
* In the [[Pokémon of the Year]] poll held by The Pokémon Company in 2020, Mimikyu was voted the most popular [[Generation VII]] Pokémon, receiving 99,077 votes. It was also the third-most popular Pokémon overall.
* In {{g|Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon}}, it is the only Pokémon that can be obtained in both versions as an obtainable {{pkmn2|Totem}}-sized Pokémon.
* Due to a [[Rollout storage glitch|glitch]], if Mimikyu is hit by {{m|Rollout}} or {{m|Ice Ball}}, the [[damage]] multiplier for these moves can also be applied to other [[move]]s. Mimikyu shares this trait with {{p|Eiscue}}. This glitch was patched out in Version 1.3.1 of {{g|Sword and Shield}}.

===Origin===
Mimikyu's disguise is based on {{p|Pikachu}}. The execution of the disguise is similar to ghost costumes made from bedsheets. Mimikyu also shares similarities with the {{wp|Bugul Noz}}, a {{wp|Breton mythology|Breton myth}} about a kind and gentle fairy spirit whose horrifying ugliness causes it to be perpetually alone. The fact that Mimikyu's true appearance can kill may be a reference to {{wp|Lovecraftian horror|Lovecraftian}} or eldritch monsters; if any person were to see their true forms, they would either be driven insane or die.

====Name origin====
<!--Do NOT add that the name may come from "mimic you".-->
Mimikyu and Mimikkyu may be derived from ''mimic'' and きゅうきゅう ''kyūkyū'' (onomatopoeia for squeaking, similar to {{p|Pikachu}}). It may also involve a corruption of 迷宮 ''meikyuu'' (mystery).
