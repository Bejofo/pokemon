'''Phione''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese:]] '''フィオネ''' ''Phione'') is a {{type|Water}} [[Mythical Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation IV]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, but can be obtained by breeding {{p|Manaphy}} or another Phione with {{p|Ditto}}.

It is a member of the [[sea guardians]] with Manaphy.

==Biology==
[[File:Phione Acid Armor.png|left|thumb|250px|A Phione blending in with the water]]
Phione is a blue {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a round head and a tiny body. Phione's head is crowned by a flotation sac with a long, ribbon-like antenna. Its mouth is small, and its eyes are large with blue sclerae and gray irises. Above its eyes are two blue, circular markings connected to the eyes by a thin black line. Its long, flipper-like arms have rounded tips. Phione has a red, oval gem on its chest and a single rudimentary foot spike.

Phione hatch from {{pkmn|egg}}s laid by {{p|Manaphy}} and small groups of Phione are seen living alongside Manaphy. However, the exact relationship between the two species is unclear. Phione possesses a sac on its head which it can use to inflate and drift in the water in search of food. When the water grows warm, it will drift in packs with others of its kind. No matter how far it has drifted, it will always return to the place where it was born. Against natural predators, it uses a defense mechanism that allows its body to blend in with ocean waters. It has the ability to {{M|Take Heart|lift its own spirit}} to heal and strengthen itself in the process.

Phione and its parent Manaphy are the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Take Heart}}.

* {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}}: A group of six Phione appeared in [[Miracle Sea]] who were driven away by an enraged, treasure-seeking {{p|Gyarados}} and, once Gyarados was defeated, gave the team the Phione Dew needed to save {{p|Manaphy}}.

==Trivia==
* Phione is the first [[Mythical Pokémon]] in [[National Pokédex]] order to not be {{t|Psychic}} type.
* Phione is the only {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that is obtainable by breeding a [[Mythical Pokémon]].
* Breeding either {{p|Manaphy}} or Phione can produce a Phione Egg, but Phione can neither evolve into Manaphy nor produce Eggs that can hatch into Manaphy.
* Phione, {{p|Nidoran♂}}, {{p|Nidoran♀}}, {{p|Illumise}}, and {{p|Volbeat}} are the only Pokémon that can be obtained by breeding a Pokémon they cannot evolve into.
* Phione has exactly the same base stats as {{p|Glalie}}.

===Mythical status===
Phione's status as a [[Mythical Pokémon]] (which were instead called [[Legendary Pokémon]] in the West prior to Generation V) has historically been contradicted by some official sources.
* [[Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver: Prima's Official Strategy Guide]] states that Phione is not Legendary (a term used at the time to describe both Legendary and Mythical Pokémon) as it can be obtained through hatching {{pkmn|Egg}}s.
* In {{g|Ranger: Guardian Signs}}, it is not classified as a Mythical Pokémon (localized as "Rare Pokémon" in English, as "Mythical Pokémon" did not exist as a distinct term in English at the time).
* The [[Pokémon Daisuki Club]]'s [http://www.pokemon.jp/special/mystery/column/02.html#column09 Mystery File] feature website omits Phione from its list of Mythical Pokémon.
* In the [[Pokémon Kids: Winter Fest]] badge collection, all other Legendary and Mythical Pokémon have special badge borders and are obtained exclusively through either opening Master pouches or clearing timed challenges. Phione has no special border and is obtained through standard bags, in the same way all non-Legendary/Mythical Pokémon are obtained.
* In the {{g|Bank}} Pokédex, all other Mythical Pokémon and {{pkmn2|Special}} Legendary Pokémon have a shiny background, but Phione does not.
* In {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Darkness}}, Phione has a full set of four [[exclusive item]]s (plus a fifth item that otherwise only appears for [[baby Pokémon]]) that can be found normally. Other Legendary and Mythical Pokémon only have one each and are found behind locked chambers in specific dungeons.
* [[Takara Tomy|TOMY]]'s 20th Anniversary plush set includes all Mythical Pokémon from [[Generation I]] to [[Generation V]], except Phione.
* In {{g|HOME}}, it is not possible to [[trade]] Mythical Pokémon via the [[Wonder Box]], Global Trade System, or [[Room Trade]]. Despite this, when HOME first launched, it was originally possible to trade Phione despite this restriction. This was fixed in a later update.

===Origin===
{{bulbanews|On the Origin of Species: Manaphy and Phione}}
Phione is likely based on {{wp|sea angel}}s, specifically ''{{wp|Clione}}''. ''Clione'' are remarkably popular in Japanese documentaries, especially in {{wp|Hokkaido}}, on which Sinnoh is based. This may also have inspired their appearance in [[Chocovine Town]].

Manaphy's trait of only being able to produce Phione as offspring may be inspired by {{wp|eusociality}}, a biological phenomenon which usually manifests in a colony of animals having a sole breeding female, or queen, tended to by her usually infertile offspring, or an example of a highly rare and unique {{wp|mutation}} such as {{wp|albinism}} or {{wp|polydactyly}}. Pokédex entries, however, suggest that Manaphy are born in cold waters and are easily affected by their environment, while Phione live in warm waters and come back to their place of birth.

====Name origin====
Phione may be a combination of ''{{p|Manaphy}}'' and ''{{wp|Clione}}'' (a genus of floating sea slugs).
