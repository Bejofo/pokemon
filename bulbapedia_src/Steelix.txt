'''Steelix''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ハガネール''' ''Haganeil'') is a dual-type {{2t|Steel|Ground}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation II]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Onix}} when [[Trade Evolution|traded]] while holding a [[Metal Coat]].

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for more details.)

Steelix can [[Mega Evolution|Mega Evolve]] into '''Mega Steelix''' using the [[Steelixite]].

==Biology==
Steelix is a long, serpentine {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with a silvery-gray body made of rock-like sections, which can possess chips and scrapes from fights and tunneling. Three of those sections have long rock spikes coming out of them on either side. It has a massive head mainly made up of its large, wide jaw with sets of large square teeth inside. Along its bottom jaw are ridges: there are two pairs of ridges on a male Steelix, while there is only one pair on a female. Several small, square lumps cover the underside of its lower jaw. Its eye sockets are slightly deep-set, and the eyes themselves are red. Its head has two long ridges going from the eyes up to the top of its head. The tip of its tail is conical with a blunt tip.

Steelix burrows up to six-tenths of a mile underground, even further than its pre-evolved form {{p|Onix}}, and it can be found in mountains or {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Cave Pokémon|caves}}. Steelix can dig even towards the {{pkmn|world}}'s core. It easily chews through boulders with its powerful jaws, and its eyes are capable of seeing in the dark. Exposure to underground heat and pressures alongside its iron-rich soil diet has made its body {{a|Sturdy|harder than diamonds}}. Steelix's Evolution is said to have been the result of an Onix's composition becoming more diamond-like after living for about 100 years. As mentioned in {{g|Sleep}}, Steelix is known to sleep in an upright postion.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref> As noted by researchers, it can maintain this superb balance without even toppling over. 

===Forms===
Steelix can [[Mega Evolve]] into Mega Steelix.

As Mega Steelix, its body becomes longer, almost doubles its mass, and gains more features. Mega Steelix's eyes turn blue and its lower jaw becomes more heavily armored with a round, curved shape. Additionally, a third pair of ridges appear on its bottom jaw, as well as two sharp, flat structures consisting of three conjoined projections on each side. The gray, rock-like spikes and its tail point have transformed into iridescent crystalline spikes; the segments from which the spikes protrude are much larger as well. In-between the head and individual spiked segments are smaller units, now adorned by a black spot with a blue hexagon on each side. 

Several metallic-looking scraps constantly rotate around its neck; these scraps react to Mega Steelix's movements and change position when attacking. The cells within its body, crystallized by the energy produced from [[Mega Evolution]], are stronger than any mineral and are able to withstand any temperature. It moves incredibly slowly, but its strengthened body is also impervious to damage, and it lashes out at foes without flinching.<ref name="Mega">http://www.pokemonrubysapphire.com/en-us/pokemon/new-mega-evolutions/mega-steelix</ref>

Steelix [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Onix}} when [[Trade Evolution|traded]] while holding a [[Metal Coat]]. Onix cannot evolve into Steelix in {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}} before the player obtains the [[National Pokédex]], as its Evolution will be interrupted. Onix also cannot evolve into Steelix in {{LGPE}}, as Steelix is not present in those games. In {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, Steelix evolves from Onix when exposed to a Metal Coat.

===Pokémon Adventures===
{{main|Jasmine's Steelix}}
In [[Pokémon Adventures]], [[Jasmine]] used a Steelix disguised as an Onix in the Gym Leader's Tournament of the opening ceremonies in the Pokémon League. [[Brock's Onix]] tightened its grip on the hidden steel Pokémon, but against the unusual hardiness of its Evolution, it only hurt itself and was eventually defeated after Steelix's stone "hide" scraped off and it was exposed. Jasmine explains that because it was a newly discovered species only so far uncovered by {{adv|Crystal}}'s capture, she tried to hide its identity, so to ensure that it wouldn't get the audience scared.

==Other appearances==
===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]===
Steelix only appears as a random trophy.
====Trophy information====
''A combination of {{t|Steel}}- and {{type|Ground}}s, Steelix are the longest Pokémon yet to be discovered, reaching over 30 feet in length. Since they live so deep under the surface of the earth, the intense pressure has made their bodies stronger than diamonds. Evolved from {{p|Onix}}, Steelix is every bit as intimidating as its relative.''

===[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for Wii U]]===
Steelix makes a cameo appearance in the {{st|Kalos Pokémon League}} stage. When the stage transitions to the {{DL|Pokémon League (Kalos)|Ironworks Chamber}}, it can be seen in the background along with {{p|Scizor}}, {{p|Klinklang}}, and {{p|Honedge}}.
====Trophy Information====
'''NA:''' ''With a body harder than diamond, this Pokemon is well suited to digging, using its powerful jaws to tunnel around. Steelix lives deep underground - even deeper than its pre-Evolution, Onix. Was it pride that made Steelix prove itself able to go farther? It's hard to say. We tried to dig around for clues, but we got tired after only 10 feet...''

'''PAL:''' ''Being harder than diamond, Steelix can crush any rock with its jaw. It can also see in pitch darkness. Its territory lies deeper than its pre-Evolution, Onix, a full 1000m below the surface. Does it consider its Onix brethren to be "below" it, even though they're higher up? It's hard to say. We may have to dig a little deeper into the matter.''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Steelix appears as a {{sbw|Spirits (characters)|Spirit}}.

==Trivia==

* All Steelix in the {{pkmn|animated series}} have used the move {{m|Iron Tail}}, excluding cameos.
* Steelix is the only Pokémon in the {{vg|Pokémon Ranger}} games that can hurt the [[Capture Styler]] simply by touching the line.
* Mega Steelix is the [[List of Pokémon by height|tallest]] Steel- and Ground-type Pokémon.
* Steelix can be seen as a parallel to {{p|Scizor}}:
** Both have pre-evolved forms from [[Generation I]] and were introduced in [[Generation II]].
** Both evolve via trading with a [[Metal Coat]].
** After evolving, both lose one of their pre-evolved form's [[type]]s and gain the {{t|Steel}} type.

===Origin===
Steelix, like Onix, may be based on a combination of a {{wp|snake}} and {{wp|earthworm}}. It may also be based on the {{wp|Tatzelwurm|bergstutz or stollwurm}}, a type of {{wp|dragon}} that has been presented as burrowing. 

Mega Steelix's crystalline body may be a reference to {{wp|graphite}} turning into {{wp|diamond}}s from compression. The blue hexagonal patterns on its body resemble {{wp|Liesegang rings (geology)|Liesegang rings}}, particularly those found in {{wp|onyx}}. Mega Steelix could also be a reference to the [[Crystal Onix]], a special {{p|Onix}} that appeared in [[EP087|an episode]] of ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'', with a body of crystal instead of opaque rock.

====Name origin====
Steelix may be a combination of ''steel'', ''helix'', and ''{{p|Onix}}'' or ''{{wp|onyx}}''.

Haganeil may be a combination of 鋼 ''hagane'' (steel) and ''nail'' or ''tail''.
