'''Dartrix''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''フクスロー''' ''Fukuthrow'') is a dual-type {{2t|Grass|Flying}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation VII]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Rowlet}} starting at [[level]] 17 and evolves into {{p|Decidueye}} starting at level 34.

In [[Hisui]], Dartrix evolves from Rowlet starting at level 17 and evolves into {{rf|Hisuian}} Decidueye starting at level 36.

==Biology==
[[File:Dartrix SM concept art.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Dartrix's proficiency with throwing its blade quills like darts]]
Dartrix is an avian {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that resembles an owl. Most of its plumage, including its heart-shaped {{wp|facial disc}}, is white, but it has dark brown feathers covering its head, shoulders, and back. Its large eyes contain dark irises and usually appear closed. It also has a stubby beak with a white upper jaw and an orange-brown lower jaw, and a few short tufts of feathers on the back of its head. Two green leaves curve around its face, resembling an {{wp|asymmetric cut}}; the leaf on its right is longer than the one on the left. Under its chin are two smaller leaves that resemble a bowtie, and there are two pointed ones on its rear that form its tail. Its wings have two tan spots on the upper side and leafy plumage close to the body on the underside. Within the leaves under its wings are two sharp orange-brown feathers known as blade quills. Dartrix has orange-brown talons with two toes facing forward and one facing backward.

This alert Pokémon is sensitive to the presence of others around it, and is capable of launching attacks on unseen enemies behind it. It propels its blade quills at enemies or prey with astounding precision. By bending the feathers, it can even alter the trajectory of its strikes. However, it can occasionally miss hitting at times. Dartrix is narcissistic by nature, spending a lot of time grooming its feathers to maintain its appearance. This compulsion will occasionally lead to it losing focus when its plumage is ruffled or dirty, even retiring from battle to preen. It has been described as a bit of a birdbrain as it has a tendency to make mistakes; when it does, it sometimes tries to cover it up, which ends up making the situation worse. A {{pkmn|Trainer}} who helps Dartrix through this difficult stage of its life will allow it to reach its full strength.<ref>[http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/dartrix/ Pokémon Sun and Moon site | Dartrix] ([https://web.archive.org/web/0/http://www.pokemon-sunmoon.com/en-us/pokemon/dartrix/ Archive])</ref> Conversely, Dartrix will refuse to listen to a Trainer who doesn't diligently help it groom.

In [[Hisui]], Dartrix tends to expose itself to sunlight in order to gain power, presumably due to the region's cold climate. As a result of the harsh environment, Dartrix becomes more sturdy when it evolves into Hisuian {{p|Decidueye}}, gaining the {{t|Fighting}} type instead of the {{t|Ghost}} type.

Dartrix and its evolutionary relatives are the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have the [[Ability]] {{a|Long Reach}}.

===Evolution===
Dartrix evolves from {{p|Rowlet}} and evolves into {{p|Decidueye}}.

In [[Hisui]], it evolves from Rowlet and evolves into {{rf|Hisuian}} Decidueye.

===Major appearances===
Dartrix debuted in ''[[SM097|No Stone Unturned!]]'', under the ownership of [[Hau]]. It battled [[Ash's Rowlet]] and was able to win. The next day, Dartrix went up against Rowlet in a [[rematch]], where it was eventually knocked out by {{m|Bloom Doom}}. It evolved into a Decidueye prior to ''[[SM128|League Offenders and Defenders!]]''.

===Minor appearances===
A Dartrix appeared in ''[[HZ085|The Pokémon Paradise of Laqua!]]'', among the Pokémon living in [[Laqua]].

A Dartrix appeared in ''[[HZ089|Where the Adventure Leads]]''.

A Student's Dartrix appeared in [[HZ090]].

{{main|Moon's Dartrix}}

==In the TCG==
{{main|Dartrix (TCG)}}
==Trivia==
* Dartrix is the only evolved form of a [[first partner Pokémon]] whose secondary type changes upon evolving into its final form, with both [[Alola]]n and {{rf|Hisuian}} {{p|Decidueye}} losing the {{type|Flying}} and gaining {{t|Ghost}} and {{t|Fighting}}, respectively. 
* Dartrix and its evolutionary relatives have several distinctions:
** They are the only {{type|Grass}} Pokémon in the {{egg3|Flying}}.
** They are the only Pokémon introduced in [[Generation VII]] to be in the Hisuian Pokédex.
** They are the only Grass-type first partner Pokémon family whose [[List of Pokémon by color|Pokédex color]] is not green. Instead, their Pokédex color is brown.
* In [[Generation IX]], prior to the Version 2.0.1 update of {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, Dartrix and its Hisuian evolved form were unable to learn {{m|Confuse Ray}}, {{m|Night Shade}}, and {{m|Light Screen}} via [[TM]], while Rowlet could.

===Origin===
Dartrix appears to be based on an {{wp|owl}}, sharing the most similarities with members of the {{wp|Barn-owl|Tytonidae}} family — species collectively known as "barn owls". In particular, it closely resembles the {{wp|Barn owl|common barn owl}}, which was introduced to {{wp|Hawaii}}, the region which [[Alola]] was based on. 

Furthermore, Dartrix's {{t|Grass}} type might be a reference to {{wp|grass owl}}s or the local {{wp|Pueo|pueo owl}}, known for flying over grassy areas on the {{wp|Hawaiian Islands}}. The two leaves around its face also support the latter, as they appear to be inspired by the noticeable outer rim around the facial disc of the Hawaiian {{wp|Pueo|pueo owl}}.

The strands of "hair" on Dartrix possibly evoke the leaves from a {{wp|seedling}} sprouting from a {{wp|seed}}.

====Name origin====
Dartrix may be a combination of ''dart'' and ''{{wp|Strix (bird)|Strix}}'' (a genus of owls) or ''tricks''.

Fukuthrow may be a combination of 梟 ''fukurō'' (owl) and ''throw''.
