'''Darmanitan''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ヒヒダルマ''' ''Hihidaruma'') is a {{type|Fire}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation V]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Darumaka}} starting at [[level]] 35.

Darmanitan has the ability to [[#Form data|change forms]] during battle, depending on its [[Ability]] and current {{stat|HP}}. If it has {{a|Zen Mode}} as its Ability, it changes from '''Standard Mode''' into '''Zen Mode''' when its HP drops to or below half in {{pkmn|battle}}. It will only be in Zen Mode while in battle. When it enters Zen Mode, it is dual-type {{2t|Fire|Psychic}}.

In [[Galar]], Darmanitan has an {{type|Ice}} [[regional form]]. It evolves from {{rf|Galarian}} Darumaka when exposed to an [[Ice Stone]]. When it enters Zen Mode, it is dual-type {{2t|Ice|Fire}}.

==Biology==
In its normal state, Darmanitan is a mainly red, squat ape-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}. It has long, bushy flame eyebrows that curl at the base, and round, black-ringed eyes. The upper portion of its tan face is separated from the lower portion by a diagonal red stripe, and its large mouth sports spiked teeth. All these facial features give the impression of a manic or angered expression. Its head has no discernible neck to distinguish it from the rest of the body and its rounded back, which culminates in a stubby tail. It has long arms with spiky hair fringes on the wrists and large tan hands, with a similar arrangement for its hind limbs. Additionally, Darmanitan has three tan ovals on its underside and two wavy lines on its back. 

In its normal state, it has {{a|Sheer Force|immense physical strength}}; a single punch can destroy a dump truck. Its power level scales with the temperature of its internal fire, which can be as hot as 2,500&nbsp;°F (1,400&nbsp;°C). Darmanitan has a long lifespan as one was recorded living for 2,500 years while sleeping in Zen Mode around [[Relic Castle]].

===Forms===
Darmanitan can change from its normal state, called Standard Mode, into Zen Mode. {{rf|Galarian}} Darmanitan can change into a different version called Galarian Zen Mode.

;Zen Mode
During Zen Mode, which is accessed by Darmanitan with the hidden Ability {{a|Zen Mode}}, its red fur and tan skin changes blue as it bears the resemblance of a Daruma doll. Its eyes turn blank, and its limbs fuse with its body, rendering them immobile. It also only has three toes, as opposed to normal Darmanitan having five. 

In this state, it is hard as a rock. As it is rendered immobile, it enters a meditative trance to sharpen its mind, using it as strength emotionally and spiritually to battle and to perform everyday activities such as gather and eat food.

====Galarian Darmanitan====
Darmanitan has a [[regional form]]: Galarian Darmanitan.

Galarian Darmanitan has blue skin and a thicker coat than Unovan Darmanitan. Its fur is white, and is adorned with several ice gems; on its face, its fur makes the shape of a beard. Atop its head is a giant snowball that resembles an afro, which is also dotted with several ice crystals.

Galarian Darmanitan's biology is the result of it adapting to the cold of the [[Galar]] region. It develops an organ that produces cold air, while its flame sac becomes dormant. This also causes its nature to change, from a belligerent personality to a gentle and timid one. It becomes so timid that it will pretend to be a snowman when it senses humans nearby. It uses the snowball on its head to store food and other things it finds, preserving them for later. When in battle, it freezes its giant snowball in order to release powerful headbutts.<ref name=SwShsite/>

;Galarian Zen Mode
Galarian Zen Mode Darmanitan resembles a snowman. Its false "head", located above its actual head, has glowing red-yellow eyes, a warped smile, and a flame sticking out at the center as its "carrot nose". Its face sports blank white eyes surrounded by a red mask-like pattern, and an angry grin showing razor-sharp teeth. Its hands become larger and orange, resembling mittens, and it has additional glowing red-yellow spots on its belly. 

When Galarian Darmanitan enters Zen Mode, its dormant flame sac reignites back to life. This causes Galarian Darmanitan's disposition to change into a maddened rampaging state. It hops around in battle and unleashes fire everywhere without any care for its surroundings, nor if its body starts to melt, making it a threat to others and itself. It will continue rampaging indiscriminately until its rage is completely gone.<ref name=SwShsite>[https://swordshield.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon-galar-region/darmanitan/ Galarian Darmanitan | Official Website | Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield]</ref>

;Signature Abilities 
Darmanitan and its Galarian form are the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Zen Mode}} as an [[Ability]]. Galarian Darmanitan is also the only known Pokémon that can have {{a|Gorilla Tactics}} as an Ability.

===Form data===
If Darmanitan has {{a|Zen Mode}} as its Ability, it changes from Standard Mode into Zen Mode when its {{stat|HP}} drops to or below half in {{pkmn|battle}}s. It will only be in Zen Mode while in battle.

Standard Mode Darmanitan is {{type|Fire}} and red in color. Zen Mode Darmanitan is {{2t|Fire|Psychic}}-type and blue in color. Galarian Darmanitan is {{type|Ice}} and white in color with blue accents, while Galarian Zen Mode Darmanitan is {{2t|Ice|Fire}}-type and white in color with red accents.

The original two forms have different stats, such that Zen Mode Darmanitan swaps the Attack and Special Attack of Standard Mode, and has higher defenses but lower Speed. On the other hand, Galarian Darmanitan, in its Zen Mode, simply has increased Attack and Speed compared to its Standard Mode.

===Origin===
Darmanitan is based on a {{wp|Daruma doll}}, and its {{t|Fire}} typing is inspired by the traditional {{wp|Daruma doll#Daruma burning|Daruma burning ceremony}}. The Daruma dolls burned at the ceremony that Darmanitan's designer attended happened to resemble {{wp|gorilla}}s, which inspired its gorilla-like appearance.<ref name=ND204>''Nintendo Dream'' Vol. 204, April 2011 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110704155314/http://shellspider.blog101.fc2.com/blog-entry-502.html Shellspider's blog (Japanese)], [http://lavacutcontent.com/ken-sugimori-nintendo-dream-2/ Translation by Dr. Lava])</ref> It may also be based on the adage of the {{wp|three wise monkeys}} — "See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil" — as Darmanitan in their Zen Mode have their eyes become blank, their mouths shut tightly and their ears covered, sitting patiently in contrast to their bold posture in their Standard Mode. Its Zen Mode may be based on {{wp|Bodhidharma}}, achieving enlightenment. The varying presence of pupils between its Standard and Zen Modes reflects the practice of painting in the {{wp|Daruma doll#Eyes|eyes of a Daruma doll}}, and their symbolic value in relation to goal fulfillment.

{{rf|Galarian}} Darmanitan may be a mixture of a {{wp|snowman}}, known as 雪だるま ''yukidaruma'' in Japanese, and the {{wp|yeti}} (also known as the abominable snowman). In its Zen Mode, it resembles a traditional snowman with a {{wp|firecracker}} instead of the common carrot nose. Furthermore, where its original form draws its origin from {{wp|Buddhism}}, Galarian Darmanitan's design may be influenced by other {{wp|Dharmic religions}}, with its "beard" and "headpiece" bearing resemblance to those of {{wp|Hindu}} and {{wp|Sikh}} elders. Its {{type|Fire}} may be a reference to {{wp|atavism}}, the reappearance of an ancestral trait after having been lost through evolutionary change in previous generations.

====Name origin====
Darmanitan may be a combination of ''{{wp|Daruma doll|Dharma}}'' (alternate spelling of ''daruma'') and ''{{wp|orangutan}}''.

Hihidaruma may be a combination of 火 ''hi'' (fire), 緋 ''hi'' (scarlet), 狒々 ''hihi'' (baboon), ''Daruma'', and 火達磨 ''hidaruma'' (the state of being on fire).
