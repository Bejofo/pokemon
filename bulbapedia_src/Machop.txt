'''Machop''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ワンリキー''' ''Wanriky'') is a {{type|Fighting}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Machoke}} starting at [[level]] 28, which evolves into {{p|Machamp}} when [[Trade Evolution|traded]] or when exposed to a [[Linking Cord]].

(Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for more details.)

==Biology==
Machop is a {{wp|humanoid}}, bipedal {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that has blue-gray skin. It has three brown ridges on top of its head, large red eyes, and a relatively flat face. On either side of its chest are three, thin, rib-like stripes. Its feet appear to have no toes, while its hands have five fingers. Machop also has a short, stubby tail.

Machop's entire body is covered with muscles that will never tire or cramp. With these muscles, it can lift many times its own body weight; it is even capable of hurling up to 100 adults. It spends its time and energy working out and practicing all different forms of martial arts, striving to improve its abilities. One of its daily training routines involves lifting boulders and {{p|Graveler}} repeatedly as if they were barbells. It becomes more dedicated the more its muscles grow. Once it feels confident, it challenges {{p|Makuhita}} to a battle. Machop lives in the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Mountain Pokémon|mountains}}, and its diet includes highly nutritious food that allows it to efficiently build up its muscles. In [[Generation II]], {{m|Vital Throw}} was its [[signature move]].

===Evolution===
Machop evolves into {{p|Machoke}}, which evolves into {{p|Machamp}}.

* {{TFG|Next Quest}}: {{TFG ID|Next Quest|Machop|29}}

==Trivia==
* Machop's Japanese name is the last Pokémon name in [[wp:gojūon|gojūon]] order, the equivalent of English alphabetical order used to sort words in Japanese.
* Before the release of the English versions of [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue]], Machop was known as "Kara-Tee". This name is a corruption of ''{{wp|karate}}'', a fighting style.

===Origin===
Machop appears to be based on a {{wp|bodybuilding|bodybuilder}}. It also possesses some reptilian features such as its face, three plate-like crests on its head, a tail, and blue-gray coloration.

====Name origin====
Machop is a combination of ''macho'' (manly; Spanish and Portuguese for male) and ''chop''.<ref>'''{{DL|Television|PokéQuiz|ポケＱポン}}''' (PokéQuiz in Japanese): 正解は　MACHOP！ マチョップ　です！ MACHOは　マッチョ CHOPは　チョップ！</ref>

Wanriky is derived from 腕 ''wan'' (arm) and 力 ''riki'' (strength);<ref>'''{{DL|Television|PokéQuiz}}''': The correct answer is Wanriky! Wan-ri-kee! “Wan” means “arm,” and “riki” means “strength.”</ref> altogether, it is derived from an alternate reading of 腕力 ''wanryoku'' (arm strength, physical strength).
