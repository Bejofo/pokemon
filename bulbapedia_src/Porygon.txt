'''Porygon''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ポリゴン''' ''Porygon'') is a {{type|Normal}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Porygon2}} when [[Trade Evolution|traded]] while holding an [[Upgrade]], which evolves into {{p|Porygon-Z}} when traded while holding a [[Dubious Disc]].

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for more details.)

==Biology==
[[File:Porygon Conversion.png|thumb|left|250px|Porygon changing its appearance using {{m|Conversion}}]]
Porygon is an {{pkmn2|artificial}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} made completely out of programming code. It has a pink, polyhedral head that ends in a blue beak and has hexagonal eyes, and it has a pink polyhedral body with a blue front, blue triangular prism feet, and a blue rectangular prism tail. In 3D games, such as [[Pokémon Stadium]], it can open its beak and can detach its limbs and head from its torso. According to its [[Pokédex entry|Pokédex entries]], it has copy protection built into its code, preventing duplication through electronic means. It was created [[History of the Pokémon world#Recent history|in 1995]] by [[Silph Co.]],<ref>[[Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia]]</ref> but documents at Silph Co. claim it was created at the [[Cinnabar Lab|Pokémon Lab]] on [[Cinnabar Island]] using the state-of-the-art technology of its time. Because it was created decades ago, many of its parts have since become obsolete. It was the first artificial Pokémon to have ever been created through computer programming. In ancient [[Hisui]], people were confused about Porygon and its Evolutions due to them arriving through [[space-time distortion]]s and being the product of far more advanced technology than what was available at the time.

Due to its man-made origins, Porygon does not need to breathe or eat, though it can still accept food if given. It has the ability to convert its body into digital data, allowing it to travel through cyberspace. Recently, it has become more helpful inside cyberspace by searching for any suspicious data that exists. Some believed Porygon has the power to potentially travel in space despite the species not displaying that ability yet. Because it is man-made, it is generally found in computers or in labs and other {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Urban Pokémon|buildings}} where people work.

Porygon and its evolved forms are the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the moves {{m|Conversion}} and {{m|Conversion 2}}. Prior to [[Generation V]], {{m|Sharpen}} was also one of its signature moves. Additionally, prior to Generation V and in [[Generation IX]], Porygon and its evolved forms are the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Download}} as an [[Ability]]. It can use Conversion to change its appearance to mimic another Pokémon's and has also demonstrated the ability to change color for camouflage.

In {{g|GO}}, Porygon can be obtained by completing 1/4 of the {{OBP|Ticketed event|GO|Ticketed Special Research}}, ''Decoding Porygon''.

===Evolution data===
Porygon [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Porygon2}} when [[Trade Evolution|traded]] while holding an [[Upgrade]], which evolves into {{p|Porygon-Z}} when traded while holding a [[Dubious Disc]]. Porygon cannot evolve into Porygon2 in {{game|FireRed and LeafGreen|s}} until the player obtains the [[National Pokédex]], as its Evolution will be interrupted. Porygon also cannot evolve into Porygon2 in {{LGPE}}, as Porygon2 is not present in those games. In {{g|Legends: Arceus}}, Porygon evolves into Porygon2 when exposed to an Upgrade, which evolves into Porygon-Z when exposed to a Dubious Disc.

[[File:Porygon Aim to Be a Pokémon Master.png|thumb|250px|Porygon in [[Aim to Be a Pokémon Master]]]]
===Major appearances===
Porygon's only major animated series appearance was in [[EP038]]. [[Dr. Akihabara]] created two specimens, {{DL|List of Pokémon temporarily owned by the Team Rocket trio|Porygon Zero|one}} of which was stolen by {{TRT}}, while the other one was borrowed by {{Ash}} and {{ashfr}}. Both remained with Dr. Akihabara at the end of the episode.

This episode caused a reported 685 viewers, (primarily children), in Japan to be transferred to hospitals by ambulance after experiencing seizure-like symptoms, due to a flashing strobe effect present at several points of the episode, and was therefore [[Banned episodes|banned]] and never aired again anywhere in the world. Since then, Porygon has never played a main role in the animated series, with its evolved forms, {{p|Porygon2}} and {{p|Porygon-Z}} not having any appearances in an episode. This incident is referred to as the {{wp|Dennō Senshi Porygon|"'''Pokémon Shock'''"}} (ポケモンショック, ''Pokemon Shokku'') in Japan.

===Minor appearances===
Porygon made its English dub debut in a scene transition in ''[[EP047|A Chansey Operation]]''. A similar transition appears in ''[[EP069|Lights, Camera, Quack-tion]]''.

Porygon appeared in the [[Who's That Pokémon?]] segment for the English dub of ''[[EP098|A Way Off Day Off]]'', and was featured with an English voice, making this the only time Porygon appeared with such a voice in the animated series.

In the opening sequence of both ''[[M04|Celebi: The Voice of the Forest]]'' and ''[[M05|Pokémon Heroes: Latios & Latias]]'' (the former only in the case of the dub, since said intro sequence was originally made for the latter), a Porygon can be seen floating behind a wire fence in a city.

In a shot in a "World of Pokémon" opening at the beginning of ''[[The Journey to be a Pokémon Master Begins!!]]'', a Porygon was floating above a fence, similar to the aforementioned {{pkmn|movie}}s.

Porygon made a cameo appearance in the "World of Pokémon" opening of ''[[M15|Kyurem VS. The Sword of Justice]]'', which featured every Pokémon from the first five [[generation]]s revealed to that point.

A Porygon appeared as an image in ''[[SM020|Partner Promises!]]''.

==In the manga==

===Pokémon Adventures===
===={{MangaArc|Red, Green & Blue}}====
{{main|Blue's Porygon}}
{{adv|Blue}} obtained a Porygon at the [[Celadon Game Corner|Rocket Game Corner]] in ''[[PS018|A Tale of Ninetales]]'', and it soon became a core member of his team. Prior to {{PAV|13}}, it evolved into a {{p|Porygon2}}.

===={{MangaArc|Platinum}}====
A Porygon appeared at the {{gdis|Battle Factory|IV}} in ''[[PS427|Uprooting Seedot]]''.

===={{MangaArc|Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon}}====
A Porygon appeared in ''[[PASM05|The Announcement and the Prize]]'', under the ownership of [[Gladion]]. It was used in a couple of battles during the [[Iki Town]] festival, helping Gladion to defeat [[Hau]] and {{adv|Moon}}.

===Pokémon Pocket Monsters===
A Porygon appeared in ''[[PM011|Finish Off Team Rocket!!]]'', under the ownership of [[Erika]]'s father.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Porygon (TCG)}}

==Other appearances==
===[[Super Smash Bros.]]===
Porygon pops out of a door on top of the [[Silph Co.]] building in the {{OBP|Saffron City|stage|Saffron City stage}}. It damages players that come into contact with it.

===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]===
Multiple Porygon appear in balloon form on the [[Poké Floats]] stage. When the fighting is on {{p|Slowpoke}}'s tail, three will travel across the top of the screen. However, they move too quickly to land on and so are little more than decoration in practice.

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Porygon retains its role as a stage element in the Saffron City stage, as well as appearing as a {{sbw|Spirit}}.

==Trivia==
* Porygon's evolutionary line has several unique attributes:
** They are the only three-stage evolutionary line whose members were all considered fully evolved during their respective debut generations. For this reason, they are the only Pokémon that are part of the same three-stage evolutionary line to all be capable of learning both {{m|Hyper Beam}} and {{m|Giga Impact}}.
** They are the only {{type|Normal}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} in the {{egg3|Mineral}}.
* Porygon is the only Pokémon that evolves by trade twice: once holding the [[Upgrade]] into {{p|Porygon2}}, and a second time (as Porygon2) into {{p|Porygon-Z}} when holding a [[Dubious Disc]].
** It is also the only Pokémon in a [[:Category:Pokémon that are part of a three-stage evolutionary line|three-stage evolutionary line]] that does not require leveling up to trigger any of its Evolutions (i.e. it is possible to acquire a Porygon-Z at level 1).
* Porygon is the only Pokémon to have its {{pkmn|category}} changed in Japanese. Its category in {{game|Red and Green|s}} is シージーポケモン ''CG Pokémon'', which was changed to バーチャルポケモン ''Virtual Pokémon'' from {{jpn|Pokémon Blue Version|Pokémon Blue}} onwards.
*In its entry in [[An Illustrated Book of POCKET MONSTERS]], Porygon is said to have been created by Silph Co. in 1995.

===Origin===
Porygon seems to be based on a {{wp|bird}} or {{wp|Orizuru|paper crane}} that has been {{wp|rendering (computer graphics)|rendered}} using digital software. The head-tipping motion it displays in some games is reminiscent of a {{wp|drinking bird}} toy. The flat shapes comprising its body are similar to the {{wp|polygon mesh}} used to create {{wp|3D computer graphics}}. Its Pokédex entries imply a connection to {{wp|artificial intelligence}} and {{wp|robotic spacecraft}}.

In a 1997 interview with the magazine Famimaga 64, [[Satoshi Tajiri]] stated that Porygon was created out of irony. According to him, during the development of {{game|Red and Green|s}}, people kept telling him that he was too late on making a game for the [[Game Boy]], and that he should start making games with 3D polygonal graphics for next generation consoles. As a result, he included Porygon, a Pokémon made out of polygons, in the sprite-based Pokémon Red and Green, hence the irony.<ref>ファミマガ64 (Famimaga 64), November 1997 issue (Japanese)</ref>

====Name origin====
Porygon is derived from ポリゴン ''porigon'' ({{wp|polygon}}).
