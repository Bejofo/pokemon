'''Klefki''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''クレッフィ''' ''Cleffy'') is a dual-type {{2t|Steel|Fairy}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation VI]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

==Biology==
Klefki is a small, grayish-white {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that resembles a key ring with four keys. It has a spherical head with a small, pink oval on its forehead. Two black circles and a keyhole form its eyes and mouth, respectively. Below its head is its pink, teardrop-shaped body with a white, teardrop-shaped marking in the middle. Extending from the top of its head is a horn that resembles an old-fashioned key with two wide, blunt teeth. Extending from either side of the key is a thin loop that surrounds Klefki. Hanging from the loop are various keys that this Pokémon has collected. As seen in the [[TCG]], the loop is highly mobile and can split both at the top and the bottom, allowing Klefki to collect new keys and even express its feelings. Klefki is very tiny, tying with Alolan {{p|Diglett}} and {{p|Meltan}} as the [[List of Pokémon by height|shortest]] {{type|Steel}} Pokémon.

Klefki are known to be even-tempered Pokémon. In the past, Klefki inhabited mines, but when the minerals on which it fed became scarce, it moved into human settlements. It now feeds on metal ions by inserting its key-like horn into chinks in metal. It likes to collect keys, particularly master keys, and will sneak into people's homes to steal them. It collects keys to feed on their metal ions, as well as to threaten predators by rattling its collection at them. It is said that Klefki's key-like appearance is the result of an adaptation to suit its habit of collecting keys. Although it feeds on keys, it will never release a key it likes, holding onto to it for decades, so people will give it important keys as a way to prevent theft. However, on rare occasions, it will discard a key without second thought. In the past, nobles kept Klefki for generations, taking great care of them while entrusting them with important vault keys.

Klefki is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Fairy Lock}}. In [[Generation VI]], {{m|Crafty Shield}} was also one of its [[signature move]]s.

==Trivia==
* Klefki was designed by [[Mana Ibe]].<ref name=GameInformer>Hilliard, Kyle (February 14, 2014). "[https://web.archive.org/web/20190714022848/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/02/14/afterwords-unabridged-pokemon-x-and-y.aspx Afterwords – Pokémon X & Y]." ''Game Informer'' (Archived on August 2, 2024).</ref>
* Klefki is the first {{t|Steel}}/{{t|Fairy}} type to debut with this type combination, as {{p|Mawile}} was pure Steel in its debut.

===Origin===
Klefki is based on keys and keychains. [[Junichi Masuda]] stated that Klefki's design specifically "came from thinking of old mansions and secret keys and such."<ref name=GameInformer/> Klefki may also be inspired by the pagan tradition of blaming fairies for the loss of small objects such as shoes and keys, or by the superstition of carrying an iron charm to ward off fae mischief.

Its general shape resembles a music {{wp|clef}}, and the keyhole shape mouth may be inspired by a cleft lip.

====Name origin====
Klefki may be a combination of ''clef'' (French for key), ''key'', and possibly ''kleftis'' (Κλέφτης, Greek for thief).

Cleffy may be derived from ''clef'' (French for key) and ''fae''.
