'''Electrode''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''マルマイン''' ''Marumine'') is an {{type|Electric}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Voltorb}} starting at [[level]] 30.

In [[Hisui]], Electrode has an {{2t|Electric|Grass}} [[regional form]]. It [[Evolution|evolves]] from Hisuian {{p|Voltorb}} when exposed to a [[Leaf Stone]].

==Biology==
Electrode is a round {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} resembling an upside-down {{i|Poké Ball}} with a smile mouth, black slit eyes, prominent black eyebrows that are usually depicted with an angry expression and eyes. Its top half is white, while its lower half is red. The [[Bandai Pokémon Carddass Cards]] depict Electrode as hollow.

Electrode tends to live in {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Urban Pokémon|power plants}} where fresh electricity is being generated, which it consumes. As a result, it often causes blackouts. The more electric energy Electrode consumes, the faster it moves. When full of stored electricity, it has been known to drift with the wind.

Electrode explodes in response to even the smallest stimulation, simply to entertain itself, or because it has taken in too much electricity. However, unlike Voltorb, Electrode can control its explosive ability at will. This unpredictable and explosive nature has earned it the nickname of "Bomb Ball". Because of its appearance, many Trainers try to pick Electrode up, mistaking it for an item. As seen in the anime, if Electrode explode to defend themselves, this also results in them using up their energy and becoming extremely worn out.

===Forms===
Electrode has a [[regional form]]: {{rf|Hisuian}} Electrode.

In [[Hisui]], Electrode also resembles an upside-down Poké Ball, specifically one of its time period, with a wooden upper half and a glossy, dark red lower half with a hole in the bottom. Its eyes are large black holes inside a debossed pattern, resembling an angry glare. Its mouth is in a constant frown, unlike its Kantonian counterpart's smile, giving the impression that it is drawn on. Interestingly, its surface texture is similar to that of an [[Apricorn]].

When enraged, Hisuian Electrode can unleash an electric current equivalent to about twenty lightning bolts. It can absorb and store chlorophyll energy along with electricity. Electrode can release this energy through the hole on its lower half. It can also climb up trees.

A special Hisuian Electrode is worshipped by the Hisui people due to it being descended from one of the ten ancient Pokémon who received a blessing from {{p|Arceus}} despite the fact that Poké Balls had not yet been invented. In particular, it is one of the [[Noble Pokémon]] who resides in the [[Coronet Highlands]], watched over by the [[Warden]] [[Melli]].

Hisuian Electrode is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Chloroblast}}.

===Evolution===
Electrode evolves from {{p|Voltorb}}.

{{rf|Hisuian}} Electrode evolves from Hisuian Voltorb.

==In the TCG==
{{main|Electrode (TCG)}}

==Other appearances==
[[File:Electrode SSBB.png|250px|thumb|An Electrode in [[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]]]
===[[Super Smash Bros.]]/[[Super Smash Bros. Melee|Melee]]/[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl|Brawl]]/[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS/Wii U|3DS and Wii U]]/[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate|Ultimate]]===
In the original Smash Bros. Electrode would appear from the doorway atop the [[Silph Co.]] building on the [[Saffron City (stage)|Saffron City stage]] and use {{m|Explosion}}, damaging any players near it. In the sequels, it would be released randomly from a {{i|Poké Ball}}. When released, Electrode will pause for a few seconds before using Explosion. It can be picked up and thrown, though this is risky as Electrode will hurt everyone near it, including the player who threw the Poké Ball. Electrode functions in ''Brawl'' in much the same way as in ''Melee''; however, sometimes, it will fail to explode. Other times, Electrode will merely pretend to fail to explode, then explode suddenly after a few seconds. Electrode appears in the fourth and fifth installments, retaining its behavior from ''Brawl''.

====Melee trophy information====
''Electrode, an electric Ball Pokémon, is the evolved form of Voltorb. It has the tendency to explode with even the slightest provocation, which has earned it the nickname "Wrecking Ball." Electrode is the quickest Pokémon found to date, and its distinctive white-over-red coloring is the opposite of Voltorb's.''

====Brawl trophy information====
''"A Ball Pokémon. The more electricity stored in its body, the quicker it moves. One danger of storing that much electricity is the slightest stimulus may cause it to explode. Moves it specializes in are {{m|Selfdestruct}} and {{m|Explosion}}. Its love of electricity cause it to gather near power plants."''

====3DS/Wii U trophy information====
[[File:Electrode 3DS trophy SSB4.png|thumb|150px|Electrode trophy in Super Smash Bros. for 3DS]]
'''NA''': ''An Electric-type Pokémon that stores energy inside its body. Nicknamed "the Bomb Ball" by some, the slightest shock risks setting this Pokémon off. If you're feeling brave, you can throw Electrode at your foes before it detonates. Handle with care, or it'll go off in your hands instead! ''

'''PAL''': ''This Electric-type Pokémon stores huge amounts of electricity in its body. It is also known as the Bomb Ball due to the fact that even the lightest touch can make it blow up. Sometimes it takes a little while for Electrode to use its Explosion attack, so you might have enough time to throw it in someone else's direction! Feeling brave?''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
Electrode appears as a {{sbw|Spirit}}.

* Electrode has a [[Oh Electrode|short song]] dedicated to it, sung by [[Suzukisan]].
* Electrode is the only non-playable Pokémon to use the same move in [[Pokkén Tournament]] and the [[Super Smash Bros.]] series.
* The author of [[Pokémon Adventures]], [[Hidenori Kusaka]], uses Electrode to represent himself in the volume's comment boxes.

===Origin===
Electrode seems to be based on the concept of a living {{i|Poké Ball}}, and is often mistaken for one. As such, its design may be inspired by ''{{wp|gashapon}}'' capsules, which often consist of a white half and a vibrant colored half. The idea of Voltorb and Electrode being mistaken for the standard Poké Balls that represent items is similar to a {{wp|Mimic (Dungeons & Dragons)|mimic}}, a monster archetype commonly found in RPGs. Its {{Shiny}} coloration is possibly based on a [[Great Ball]].

Electrode may also be based on a {{wp|ball lightning}}, as hinted by its spherical shape, type, explosive behavior, and tendency to drift on wind. Based on its Japanese name and its explosive tendencies, Electrode may have some connection to {{wp|land mine}}s or {{wp|bomb}}s.

The expressions on both Electrode and Voltorb may be a personification of the positive and negative charges associated with {{wp|electric charge}}. For their original forms, Voltorb has a negative angry look, where Electrode has a positive happy look. The polarity of these expressions, or charges, are reversed for their Hisuian forms.

Hisuian Electrode and its {{t|Grass}} typing may be based on the fact that Poké Balls were originally made from [[Apricorn]]s, which may be based on {{wp|Castanea crenata|Japanese chestnut}} or {{wp|acorn}}s. It may also be based on traditional Japanese fireworks: they are spherical in shape, with shells made of {{wp|papier-mâché}}, charges inside that are often made with rice husks, and a hole where the fuse goes. This can be seen in the [[TCG]] and its statue at the [[Temple of Sinnoh]], which all depict it emitting blasts from a hole on its bottom to launch itself. Its {{Shiny}} coloration may be based on an {{hi|Ultra Ball}} or a {{hi|Heavy Ball}}.

====Name origin====
Electrode may be a portmanteau of ''electric'' and ''explode'' or ''node'' (a computer or program), as well as a pun on ''{{wp|electrode}}'', a device through which electrical currents pass (although such a device is usually in the shape of a rod).

Marumine may be a combination of 丸 ''maru'' (circle) and ''{{wp|mine}}'', as in {{wp|landmine}}.
