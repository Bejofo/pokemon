'''Lokix''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''エクスレッグ''' ''Exleg'') is a dual-type {{2t|Bug|Dark}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation IX]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] from {{p|Nymble}} starting at [[level]] 24.

==Biology==
[[File:4KomaPlaza451.png|thumb|left|250px|Lokix in its Showdown Mode]]
Lokix is a bipedal, insectoid {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} which resembles a locust. It is primarily dark gray, with glossy black colorations on the head, thorax, lower abdomen, forearms, lower legs, and third set of legs. Its face is covered in a mask-like plate, and contains a pair of black triangular antennae with two white stripes on top, along with orange triangular eyes and a triangular notch on its chin. Its thorax and abdomen are separated by a white belt, with an X-shaped pattern at the front. It has a pair of white claws on each of its hands, and a single claw on each foot. Its forearms have an orange spike each, while its calves have two orange spikes protruding towards the back.

Behind Lokix's body is its third set of legs, attached to its abdomen. These legs are oblong with a symbol resembling the {{wp|No symbol|general prohibition sign}} on the outside of the joints, and connect to thin, rectangular forelimbs. Each of the forelimbs have five orange spikes and a single white claw at the bottom. Lokix usually keeps its third set of legs folded on its back; however, it can unfold these legs to enter what is known as its Showdown Mode.

In Showdown Mode, Lokix stands and jumps on its now-unfolded third set of legs, and swings them to attack. Lokix utilizes its Showdown Mode to fight all-out, being capable of quickly subduing its foes in this mode. However, it cannot be in Showdown Mode for too long, as it places a huge strain on its body. Lokix can live in a variety of different areas in Paldea, such as grasslands, snowy mountains, deserts, and lakes.

===Evolution===
Lokix evolves from {{p|Nymble}}.

==Trivia==
[[File:Lokix Helmets Seguro.png|thumb|250px|Lokix helmet options from [[Seguro Style]] in [[Cascarrafa]]]]
* No other Pokémon has the same [[List of Pokémon with unique type combinations|type combination]] as Lokix.
* Riding helmets resembling Lokix's head can be purchased with varying colors as part of Trainer customization in {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}.
* Lokix, along with {{p|Buneary}}, is one of the only Pokémon with 0 [[List of Pokémon by base friendship|base friendship]] that is neither a [[Legendary Pokémon]], a [[Mythical Pokémon]], an [[Ultra Beast]], nor a [[Paradox Pokémon]].

===Origin===
Lokix appears to be based on a {{wp|grasshopper}}, particularly those of the {{wp|locust}} variety, which are notably larger than other grasshopper varieties and have a swarming phase. Its inability to fly in favour of kicking is also similar to various {{wp|wētā}} species, flightless crickets with large legs known to give strong kicks to would-be predators. Its Dark typing could be derived from the fact that grasshoppers and locusts are generally considered to be pests, and its debut in [[Paldea]] may refer to the fact that southern Iberia is the only region in Europe to be affected by locust plagues. It may also be based on {{wp|Tridactylidae|pygmy mole crickets}} due to its coloration and rounded features. The way its third set of legs fold up resembles the Spanish {{wp|navaja}}s; and its kick-based fighting style may be inspired by {{wp|tae kwon do}}.

<!--DO NOT CHANGE TO NAME A SPECIFIC RIDER. REFERENCING THE FRANCHISE IS FINE, NOT A SPECIFIC CHARACTER.-->
Lokix also appears to be based on the superheroes of the ''{{wp|Kamen Rider}}'' franchise. The titular Riders typically have an insect motif (most often being the grasshopper), a belt used to transform into their masked alter-egos, a limitation on how long they can hold the transformation, and a signature finishing move known as the ''Rider Kick''. All of these elements are present in the design of Lokix. Its Dark type thus may reference the themes of morality in the ''Kamen Rider'' series, as many of the Riders are considered {{wp|antihero}}es, and their powers typically derive from the same sources and technology as the forces of evil they fight against. Additionally, the Riders are known for riding motorcycles, and while Lokix itself does not have any strong allusion to motorcycles or motocycling, motorbike helmets based on its design are sold in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.

====Name origin====
Lokix may be a combination of ''locust'' and ''kicks'' or ''crickets'', or a pun on ''low kicks''.

Exleg may be a combination of ''extreme'', ''expert'', or ''exoskeleton'', and ''leg''.
