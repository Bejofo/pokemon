'''Magnemite''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''コイル''' ''Coil'') is a dual-type {{2t|Electric|Steel}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]]. Prior to [[Generation II]], it [[:Category:Pokémon that have had their type changed|was]] a pure {{type|Electric}} Pokémon.

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Magneton}} starting at [[level]] 30, which evolves into {{p|Magnezone}} when [[level]]ed up in a [[special magnetic field]] or when exposed to a [[Thunder Stone]].

(Specifics may differ in past games. Refer to [[#Evolution data|Game data&rarr;Evolution data]] for these details.)

==Biology==
Magnemite is a seemingly {{wp|robot|robotic}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that has a gray, spherical metal body, with blue-and-red tipped horseshoe magnets on each side and a single, large eye. It has three {{wp|Phillips head}} screws on its body: two near the bottom of its body and the one on top of its head that looks similar to an antenna. The two bottom screws serve no noticeable purpose, although they may be its feet as the Pokédex identifies a footprint similar to that of the screw's head. Even though Magnemite and its evolved forms are mechanical creatures, it is shown in the ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' episode ''[[EP101|Get Along, Little Pokémon]]'' that it has emotions and a way of reproducing. In ''[[EP195|The Poké Spokesman]]'', it exhibited the need to eat, although its main form of nutrition are electrical currents. It is commonly found in locations such as {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Rough-terrain Pokémon|power plants or caves}} with a strong magnetic field. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, [[Media:Neo Premium File 2.jpg|Magnemite has been depicted in carvings]] discovered at the [[Ruins of Alph]]. It has also been present in [[AZ]]'s retelling of the [[Kalos]] war, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years.

The magnetic units on Magnemite's body generate an electromagnetic field that allows it to defy gravity and can potentially disrupt electrical equipment. The units generate stronger magnetic fields the faster they rotate. Magnemite is not known to be unnecessarily aggressive but they may approach Trainers with little notice. If a wild Magnemite is approached, [[Escape#Wild Pokémon|it may simply flee]] on rare occasions, as Magnemite does not care for interaction. However, if attacked, it will retaliate with non-damaging moves. In the care of a Trainer, it can be a devoted fighter. However, as seen in the {{aniseries|PTS}} episode ''[[EP195|The Poké Spokesman]]'', it's shown that it may be deterred unless a strong bond is formed with its Trainer. Should it run out of electricity, Magnemite will fall to the ground. Usually, batteries can help recharge it in order for Magnemite to start moving again.

Magnemite can be attracted to anything emitting electricity or a magnetic field, including gadgets such as a [[Pokétch]]. In the episode ''[[EP030|Sparks Fly for Magnemite]]'', it is shown to be attracted to electric Pokémon producing such fields. With modern electrical lines buried underground, Magnemite attacks on power plants have increased. To prevent power outages, these power plants deliberately send out signals Magnemite cannot stand to ward them off. As mentioned in [[Pokémon Sleep]], Magnemite is known to sleep airbone by generating electromagnetic waves from its side magnets.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref>There are rare occasions where while Magnemite sleeps and muddles to the direction of its waves, it will loop in the air while sleeping.

===Evolution===
Magnemite evolves into {{p|Magneton}}, which evolves into {{p|Magnezone}}.

===NPC appearances===
* {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team}}: A group of Magnemite are the clients of the game's second mission, sending the player to save their friend who is trapped in [[Thunderwave Cave]]. One of the Magnemite decides to join the rescue team a couple of days later.
* {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness}}: Two Magnemite serve as {{p|Magnezone}}'s police units.

===Evolution data===
Magnemite [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Magneton}} starting at [[level]] 30, which, since [[Generation IV]], evolves into {{p|Magnezone}} when [[level]]ed up in a [[special magnetic field]]. Magneton cannot evolve into Magnezone in {{game|HeartGold and SoulSilver|s}}, due to there being no area in [[Kanto]] or [[Johto]] with a special magnetic field. Magneton also cannot evolve in {{LGPE}}, as Magnezone is not present in those games. There is also no special magnetic field in {{g|Sword and Shield}} or {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, so from [[Generation VIII]] onwards, Magneton is also able to evolve into Magnezone when exposed to a [[Thunder Stone]].

Magnemite appears in the background of the {{st|Prism Tower}} stage in the 3DS version of the game. It also appears as a trophy exclusive to the 3DS version.

====Trophy information====
''Instantly recognizable by the horseshoe magnets on either side of its body, this Magnet Pokémon uses electromagnetic waves to nullify gravity and float in midair. The sense of nostalgia it inspires has only been strengthened by the many years that have passed since its debut in the very first Pokémon games.''

==Trivia==
* In the [[Pokémon Red and Green beta|Pokémon Red and Blue beta]], Magnemite was originally known as "Coil", which was derived from its Japanese name.
* Magnemite and its [[Evolution|evolved]] form were the first Pokémon to ever change typing with the progress of [[generation]]s.
* Despite most of Magnemite's [[Pokédex entry|Pokédex entries]] saying they are able to float through the air by employing powerful electromagnetic waves or even anti-gravity, Magnemite does not have the [[Ability]] {{a|Levitate}}, so it is still affected by {{type|Ground}} moves. However, starting in [[Generation IV]], Magnemite can learn {{m|Magnet Rise}}, which simulates Levitate for five turns.
* Magnemite and Magneton are two of the few Pokémon that had their [[cry]] changed slightly in [[Generation III]]. This was due to Generation III utilizing a better sound effects game engine and [[Game Boy Advance|newer game system]].
* {{g|Snap}} is one of the few times that two Magnemite have been shown bonding, similar to a Magneton. However, when a picture is taken, they are still called Magnemite.
** {{g|Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team}} also showed this, but it was stated to be a failed Evolution, due to the lack of a third Magnemite.
* In 2008, Japanese internet users spammed votes for Magnemite on a {{wp|Yahoo! Kids}} poll featuring 9 Pokémon appearing in ''[[M11|Giratina and the Sky Warrior]]''. Since then, several Japanese Pokémon polls have received an unusual amount of votes for Magnemite, including the 2021 [[Pokémon of the Year]] poll, when it came in 1st place for [[Kanto]] Pokémon.
* In [[Generation V]], Magnemite was the most traded Pokémon on the [[GTS]]. This is probably due to what is known as the Magnemite chain/coil: a scheme by which players could increase the number of visitors to their [[Join Avenue]] in {{2v2|Black|White|2}} by trading Magnemite on the GTS. The scheme originated with Japanese players and became popular worldwide.
* Magnemite was designed by [[Ken Sugimori]], based on an idea by [[Satoshi Tajiri]].<ref name=USUMPokédex>"What It Takes to Create a Pokémon." Interview with Ken Sugimori in ''[[Pokémon Ultra Sun & Pokémon Ultra Moon Edition: The Official National Pokédex]]'', p. xv</ref>
* On May 31, 2017, [[The Pokémon Company]] posted a Magnemite-themed music video onto their YouTube channel titled [[Where is Coil? Here is Coil!]].

===Origin===
Magnemite is based on {{wp|magnet}}s<ref name=USUMPokédex/> and screws, and in broader terms, possibly an objectification of {{wp|electromagnetism}}, one of the four {{wp|fundamental interactions}} of nature. Magnemite's mysterious mechanical nature, ability to levitate, and appearance on [[Johto Route 39]] — where the [[Moomoo Farm]] is located — suggest inspirations from {{wp|UFO}}s and the idea of aliens kidnapping cattle.

====Name origin====
Magnemite may be a combination of ''magnet'' and ''mite'' (minute object). It may also play on ''{{wp|magnetite}}'' and/or ''{{wp|maghemite}}'', iron oxide minerals that can, under specific conditions, become permanent magnets.

Coil may refer to ''{{wp|electromagnetic coil}}''.
