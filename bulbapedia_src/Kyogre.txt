'''Kyogre''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''カイオーガ''' ''Kyogre'') is a {{type|Water}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation III]].

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon, Kyogre can undergo [[Primal Reversion]] and become '''Primal Kyogre''' if it holds the [[Blue Orb]].

Kyogre possesses the ability to expand the oceans. In ancient times, it came into conflict with {{p|Groudon}}, a Pokémon with the ability to expand continents. In {{game3|Ruby and Sapphire|Pokémon Sapphire|s}}, {{v2|Emerald}}, and {{pkmn|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|Alpha Sapphire}}, Kyogre is sought after by [[Team Aqua]] as part of their plot to create more habitats for aquatic Pokémon by raising the sea level.

Kyogre is the [[game mascot]] of Pokémon Sapphire and its [[remake]], Pokémon Alpha Sapphire, appearing on the boxart of both games in its normal and Primal forms respectively.

Along with {{p|Groudon}} and {{p|Rayquaza}}, Kyogre is one of the [[super-ancient Pokémon]].

==Biology==
[[File:Archie Mindscape.png|thumb|left|200px|Kyogre slumbering in [[Seafloor Cavern]]]]
[[File:Kyogre Cave of Origin ORAS.png|thumb|240px|{{ga|May}} riding Kyogre]]
Kyogre is a massive, {{wp|whale}}-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with two big pectoral fins, each with four white square-shaped nails. It has a deep blue body and a white chin area with two small spikes protruding under it. Above each eye are two white, oval-shaped spots. Kyogre has red stripes around its chin, eyes, dorsal fins, and torso. These stripes glow when Kyogre is brimming with power. The tail is tattered with four trailing parts, with the inner ones being smaller than the outer. Its eyes are small, yellow, and shadowed with black.

Kyogre is believed to be the personification of the sea itself, and is also described in mythology as the creator of the world's ocean. Kyogre is among the most powerful Pokémon, capable of {{a|Drizzle|summoning intense rainstorms}} to cloak the world's entire sky. As Kyogre slumbers in [[Seafloor Cavern]], it is coated in a layer of rock that will be shattered if it is awakened by the [[Blue Orb|Blue]] or [[Red Orb]]. It is said to have expanded the ocean by generating heavy rainstorms and tidal waves. Kyogre is hailed as a savior for quenching areas of the world plagued with drought. 

Kyogre is normally calm and peaceful, but if it encounters its rival, {{p|Groudon}}, Kyogre will engage in a cataclysmic battle against it. This battle can only be stopped by the intervention of {{p|Rayquaza}}. Kyogre is known to enter a deep slumber after this conflict with Groudon. Kyogre is able to fly when it has no water to swim in. Kyogre can attack its foes with {{m|Origin Pulse|many beams of blue light energy}} or by {{m|Surf|summoning jets of water}}. Kyogre generally lives deep in the {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Sea Pokémon|ocean}} and is said to rest in a deep trench. Kyogre loves [[Kyogre Treat]]s made by [[Snacksworth]], who once encountered it in the past.

Kyogre is the [[signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Origin Pulse}}. Prior to [[Generation V]], {{a|Drizzle}} was its [[signature Ability]].

===Forms===
[[File:Encountering Primal Kyogre ORAS.png|thumb|right|<!--APNG, do not set a thumbnail size-->Encountering Primal Kyogre]]
Kyogre can undergo [[Primal Reversion]] and become Primal Kyogre.

Primal Kyogre retains its general body structure but grows to more than double the size of its base form. Its main skin color becomes a darker shade of blue, the red markings along its body become light blue, and its eyes glow yellow with orange irises and orange-red pupils. The markings on its pectoral fins slightly change to form {{tt|α|Alpha}} symbols, which connect to its outer nails with red markings connecting the inner nails. Every part of its skin that was white in its base form becomes clear and translucent, with the large ovals on its head now connected to clear markings stretching from its tail to its forehead, where another {{tt|α|Alpha}} symbol is formed. The trailing parts of its tail grow longer and gain translucent webbing, and the areas between its pectoral fin markings also become clear. The translucent parts of its body reveal organ-like structures that glow with a mysterious light; it has a large "organ" at the center of its body, two smaller ones aligned with the large oval markings, and two more located in its pectoral fins.

The primal form of Kyogre is said to be Kyogre's true and original form and is at its full power when in the Primal state. Primal Kyogre received its name from the ancient people of Hoenn who it tormented in the past.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150208024506/http://www.pokemonrubysapphire.com/en-us/pokemon/legendary-pokemon/primal-groudon-and-primal-kyogre | Primal Groudon and Primal Kyogre | Official Site | Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire]</ref> Primal Kyogre's ability to expand the sea has been augmented further. In the [[XY049|Mega Evolution Pokédex Short]], Primal Kyogre is said to have widened the seas by a large margin simply by taking a swim. Its body matches the composition of seawater, while its skin glows similarly to that of a sapphire.<ref name="Mega">[https://web.archive.org/web/20150202062721/http://www.pokemonrubysapphire.com/en-us/pokemon/legendary-pokemon/primal-kyogre | Primal Kyogre]</ref> With its weather-manipulating powers, {{a|Primordial Sea|it can nullify}} {{type|Fire}} [[move]]s. 

Primal Kyogre was formed from the natural primal energy that existed in [[Hoenn]]'s ancient past. It feeds on that same energy so it can maintain its primal form in the present day, after it was undone in the past by [[Mega Evolution|Mega]] Rayquaza. Due to the lack of Primal energy in the surface, it is forced to find either a source underground, like the stones in the [[Cave of Origin]], or the Blue Orb, allowing it to undergo a [[Primal Reversion]]. Primal Kyogre along with Primal Groudon have the power to disrupt the planet's balance, with the risk of it being destroyed.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150209222143/http://www.pokemonrubysapphire.com/en-us/pokemon/legendary-pokemon/the-legends-of-hoenn-continue | The Legends of Hoenn Continue]</ref>

Primal Kyogre is the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] with {{a|Primordial Sea}} as its [[Ability]].

===NPC appearances===
* [[Pokémon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire]]: Kyogre is the focus of the second Bonus Field on the [[Sapphire Field]]. Kyogre will first use {{m|Sheer Cold}} to freeze the ball in place. It will then create {{m|whirlpool}}s to trap the ball further. Finally, it will {{m|dive}} into the water to evade being hit completely. However, air bubbles will appear where it is about to rise out of the water. Kyogre must be hit 15 times in three minutes to win. After beating the round twice, Kyogre will be captured.
* [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness]]: Kyogre is the guardian of the [[Seven Treasures|Aqua-Monica]].

===Form data===
====Primal Kyogre====
Primal Kyogre is an additional form for Kyogre that is the result of undergoing [[Primal Reversion]]. If Kyogre is sent into battle while holding a [[Blue Orb]], it will change into Primal Kyogre; it only loses its form when the battle ends.

Primal Kyogre is only available in [[Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire|Pokémon Omega Ruby, Alpha Sapphire]], [[Pokémon Sun and Moon|Sun, Moon]], [[Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon|Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon]]. It was removed in [[Generation VIII]] along with [[Mega Evolution]].

In [[Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon]], Primal Kyogre is not available to the player, with the form only being used in the fight against it. In [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX]], it is accessed by using [[Empowerment Seed]] on Kyogre inside a dungeon.

===Main series===
====Major appearances====
====={{DL|Kyogre and Groudon (Ruby and Sapphire series)|Kyogre|Kyogre (''Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire'')}}=====
Kyogre made its physical animated series debut in ''[[AG097|Gaining Groudon]]''. [[Team Magma]] had captured Kyogre but didn't have [[Red Orb|the correct orb]] to control it, so they planned to make a trade with [[Team Aqua]], who had captured Groudon. The trade was about to be made when [[Archie]] decided to use Kyogre to destroy everyone, including his fellow henchmen. In ''[[AG098|The Scuffle of Legends]]'', the {{pkmn|battle}} between Kyogre and Groudon occurred.

====={{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (XY series)|Kyogre|Kyogre (''Pokémon the Series: XY'')}}=====
In ''[[XYS02|Mega Evolution Special II]]'', a Kyogre was awakened by the presence of the [[Giant Rock]]. In ''[[XYS03|Mega Evolution Special III]]'', it was shown in its [[Primal Reversion|primal state]], fighting with Primal {{DL|Super-ancient Pokémon (XY series)|Groudon}} over the Giant Rock.

=====Other=====
In ''[[M09|Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea]]'', a Kyogre was among countless other {{type|Water}} Pokémon that arrived at [[Samiya]] when {{Ash}} replaced all of the [[Sea Crown]]'s crystals. However, when [[the Phantom]] attempted to make all the Water-types panic using supersonic waves from his ship, Kyogre was part of the ensuing commotion. {{OBP|Manaphy|M09}} calmed them down using {{m|Heart Swap}} to rid the Pokémon of their confusion, and some {{p|Wailord}} broke open the Phantom's ship, followed by some {{p|Chinchou}} swimming into the opening and short-circuiting the ship. Kyogre then used {{m|Hyper Beam}} on the ship, destroying it.

In the beginning scene of ''[[M18|Hoopa and the Clash of Ages]]'', a Kyogre was summoned by {{an|Hoopa}} to defeat it in the past. A Primal Kyogre was later one of six [[Legendary Pokémon]] summoned and hypnotized by the shadow {{DL|List of Pokémon with form differences|Hoopa|Hoopa Unbound}} as its reinforcements. It and its teammates engaged in a battle against the {{p|Latios}}, {{p|Latias}}, and {{Shiny}} {{p|Rayquaza}} summoned to protect the real Hoopa in [[Dahara City]]. Eventually, after the shadow Hoopa was sealed in a [[Prison Bottle]], the hypnosis on Primal Kyogre and the other Legendary Pokémon was lifted, and Primal Kyogre departed for its home.

In ''[[SM120|The One That Didn't Get Away!]]'', a Kyogre had been {{status|poison}}ed and was being pursued by [[Hunter D]] and [[Hunter D's crew members|his crew members]]. However, {{an|Lana}} was able to feed it some bait laced with [[Antidote]], restoring its health and allowing it to defeat the hunter. However, Kyogre was still enraged because of the hunters' actions, forcing Lana to reel it in with her [[fishing|fishing rod]] and have her newly evolved {{TP|Lana|Primarina}} sing to it in order to calm it down. After Lana calmed Kyogre down, it thanked her for restoring its health and calming it down before leaving peacefully.

===[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]===
After being released from a {{i|Poké Ball}}, Kyogre opens its mouth and squirts out {{m|Hydro Pump|a stream of water}}. The water is non-damaging but causes characters to be knocked back with extreme force. Touching Kyogre's body will do damage. Kyogre also appears as a trophy.

====Trophy information====
''"A Sea Basin Pokémon. It brought down heavy rains, which formed seas and relieved droughts. It is usually found slumbering at the bottom of an ocean trench. Its attack {{m|Sheer Cold}} is a technique so powerful, it causes any opponent it strikes to [[one-hit knockout move|faint instantly]]. In battle, it causes clouds to form and drenches the area in rain. It once had a fierce battle with {{p|Groudon}}."''

====Trophy information====
'''NA''': ''This Water-type Pokémon roughly resembles an orca whale, though its large fins also look a bit like hands. Be wary of its Hydro Pump attack, which is capable of sending you flying off the stage. Even worse, it will chase after you, making it even harder to recover from the attack.''

'''PAL''': ''This orca-like Water-type Pokémon is known for the distinctive shape of its fins and the red markings along its body. It will use Hydro Pump to send fighters flying off the stage, and then proceed to chase after them to make recovering from the attack a nightmare.''

==Trivia==
[[File:Marina.png|thumb|175px|{{OBP|Marina|Battle Revolution}}'s Kyogre costume]]
* Kyogre's {{stat|Special Attack}} and {{stat|Attack}}, and {{stat|Special Defense}} and {{stat|Defense}} stats are the reverse of Groudon's.
* Prior to {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, Kyogre had a catch rate of 5.
* [[Spenser]] has a staff with Kyogre's markings on it.
* [[Primal Reversion|Primal]] Kyogre has the highest base {{stat|Special Attack}} stat, base {{stat|Special Defense}} stat, and base stat total of all {{type|Water}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}.
* In {{g|Battle Revolution}}, {{OBP|Marina|Battle Revolution}} has a [[Pokémon cosplay|costume]] based on Kyogre.
* In {{g|Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire}}, a Kyogre that knows {{m|Surf}} will allow the {{player}} to surf more quickly than with other {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} (except for {{p|Sharpedo}}). This action has its own animation and larger hitbox.
** Additionally, a Kyogre that knows {{m|Dive}} will allow the player to avoid underwater Trainer battles. This action also has its own animation and a larger hitbox.

===Origin===
Kyogre may be a personification of the Earth's oceans. Its conflict with Groudon is similar to that of {{wp|Leviathan}} and {{wp|Behemoth}}, who would start a battle that would kill them both at the end of time. Like Kyogre, Leviathan is associated with the sea, and the Hebrew word for Leviathan is now used for whales in Modern Hebrew, which may be why Kyogre's appearance also draws inspiration from {{wp|cetacean}}s, especially the {{wp|Killer whale|orca}}. However, Leviathan does not resemble Kyogre in traditional depictions.

The patterns on Kyogre and Primal Kyogre's fins appear similar to the first letter of Greek alphabet, {{wp|alpha}}, which might signify the origin of life, believed to have started in the oceans. It might also signify the opposition to {{p|Groudon}}'s {{wp|omega}}.

====Name origin====
Kyogre is a combination of 海 ''kai'' (sea) or 海王 ''kaiō'' (king of the sea) and ''{{wp|ogre}}''.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSpN7TDmmm4 Interview] with [[Nob Ogasawara]] by [[TheSpeedGamers]].</ref> It may also involve ''{{wp|orca}}'' (killer whale).
