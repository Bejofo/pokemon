'''Gimmighoul''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''コレクレー''' ''Collecurei'') is a {{type|Ghost}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation IX]].

It [[Evolution|evolves]] into {{p|Gholdengo}} when [[level]]ed up while the player has 999 [[Gimmighoul Coin]]s. After the Evolution, the Gimmighoul Coins disappear. Gimmighoul's Evolution cannot be canceled with the B button.

Gimmighoul has two separate [[#Form data|forms]]: '''Chest Form''' and '''Roaming Form'''. Chest Form Gimmighoul only appears in {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, in which it is the only form that can be natively {{pkmn|battle}}d and {{pkmn2|caught}}, while Roaming Form Gimmighoul will flee when interacted with, leaving behind Gimmighoul Coins. Roaming Form appears in {{g|GO}}, where it can be caught; it can then be [[transfer]]red to the core series games via the [[GO Transporter]].

==Biology==
Gimmighoul is a small, blue-gray, metallic, bipedal Pokémon, with bands of two thin black stripes present around its torso and between its gold, circular eyes. It has a pair of thin black antennae and a tail, which are bent near the base and tipped with small gold circles.  

Its antennae vibrate when detecting something it deems notable, and will point at objects of interest. When Gimmighoul gathers 999 [[Gimmighoul Coin]]s, it evolves into {{p|Gholdengo}}.

===Forms===
Gimmighoul has two separate forms: Chest Form and Roaming Form. The two Forms are virtually identical to each other, with the main differences being their habits and personalities.

;Chest Form
[[File:Gimmighoul closed chest anime.png|200px|thumb|left|Chest Form Gimmighoul's closed chest]]

Chest Form Gimmighoul hides inside a red chest, decorated with black and golden accents and a silver buckle with an ornate oval pattern, resembling the number 1,000 when viewed from the side. The chest it resides in is full of the [[Gimmighoul Coin|coins]] that it collects.

Chest Form Gimmighoul was born inside a chest 1,500 years ago. [[Jacq]] is the one who discovered the Chest Form and coined its name. Its treasure chest provides defense but makes it hard for it to move due to the weight. Chest Form Gimmighoul are typically encountered in ancient [[Paldea]]n buildings, such as watchtowers and fort ruins, and even secluded islands. Its disguise and low movement speed cause it to be commonly mistaken for an antique and get left behind or taken away. As depicted in [[HZ103]], Chest Form Gimmighoul can move by hopping. When Chest Form Gimmighoul senses an approaching person or Pokémon, it uses ghost energy to control its target and force them to collect coins for its chest. It tends to hide in less frequented places such as warehouses and shop corners to ambush people and Pokémon while pretending to be an old treasure chest. Its control has notable persistence<ref name="SVsite">[https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/pokemon/gimmighoul/ Gimmighoul — Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet | Official Website]</ref>; one old tale tells of a Gimmighoul who manipulated a young girl to gather 999 coins to fill its chest<ref name="GimmighoulYT" />. It is also known to drain the life out of anyone who attempts to steal its coins. 
;Roaming Form
Roaming Form Gimmighoul, unlike its counterpart, doesn't hide in a chest and instead carries an [[Gimmighoul Coin|ancient coin]] on its back, being held by its tail. Without its chest, it is among the [[List of Pokémon by height|smallest]] and [[List of Pokémon by weight|lightest]] of all Pokémon.

Roaming Form Gimmighoul was born from passion that seeped into a coin. [[Professor Willow]] is the one who discovered the Roaming Form and coined its name. Roaming Form Gimmighoul can be spotted in hiding places across Paldea, such as by signs, rocks, and bridges, as well as ancient ruins. It is extremely timid, running away and dropping its coin as soon as anyone approaches.<ref name="SVsite" /> It does not manipulate people and Pokémon to give it coins like its Chest Form counterpart; instead, it is able to gather coins by itself.<ref name="GimmighoulYT" /> Despite being found in [[Paldea]], no one has ever been able to capture this form of Gimmighoul. It constantly wanders, believed to be searching for the chest it used to live in. For sustenance, it drains the life force of humans who try to steal its coin. This form of Gimmighoul has also been seen appearing where Professor Willow lives in, where it tags along near Trainers who pick up Gimmighoul Coins.<ref name="SVsite" /> Gimmighoul has also been observed being lured over through the [[Coin Bag]] and [[Golden Lure Module]]s.<ref>https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/news/pokemon_go_gimmighoul/</ref>

===Form data===
Gimmighoul has two non-interchangeable forms: Chest Form and Roaming Form. Both can be found in [[Paldea]]'s overworld, but only Chest Form can be {{pkmn|battle}}d and [[catching|caught]], while Roaming Form will flee upon being interacted with, leaving behind Gimmighoul Coins, which are necessary for Gimmighoul to evolve. Roaming Form can only be obtained by [[transfer]]ring it from {{g|GO}} via the [[GO Transporter]].

The forms differ in their {{Abilities}}, with Chest Form having {{a|Rattled}} and Roaming Form having {{a|Run Away}}, as well as their [[base stats]], with Chest Form having higher {{stat|Defense}} and {{stat|Special Defense}} but lower {{stat|Speed}} compared to Roaming Form.

==Trivia ==
* Gimmighoul's Chest Form was named by [[Jacq]], while its Roaming Form was named by [[Professor Willow]].<ref name="GimmighoulYT">"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nzi0S3NGzg Where are these mysterious coins coming from? &#129300; | Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet]." [https://www.youtube.com/c/pokemon The Official Pokémon YouTube Channel]. ''YouTube''.</ref>
* Gimmighoul is the only Pokémon with multiple [[form]]s that have no bearing on the Pokémon/form of the Pokémon they evolve into.
* Gimmighoul is the only Pokémon whose [[Evolution]] requires [[TM Material]]s.
* Both forms of Gimmighoul are tied with Unovan {{p|Yamask}} and {{p|Litwick}} for having the lowest base {{stat|Attack}} stat of all {{type|Ghost}} Pokémon.
* Chest Form Gimmighoul has the lowest base {{stat|Speed}} stat of all Ghost-type Pokémon.
* Roaming Form Gimmighoul has the lowest base {{stat|Defense}} stat of all Ghost-type Pokémon.
* Roaming Form Gimmighoul is tied with {{p|Sinistea}} and {{p|Poltchageist}} as the [[List of Pokémon by height|shortest]] Ghost-type Pokémon, and tied with {{p|Gastly}} and {{p|Haunter}} as the [[List of Pokémon by weight|lightest]] Ghost-type Pokémon.
** Roaming Form Gimmighoul is tied with {{p|Flabébé}} for being the smallest Pokémon overall: both have a height of 0.1&nbsp;m and a weight of 0.1&nbsp;kg.
* Gimmighoul is the only Pokémon in {{g|GO}} that evolves without {{OBP|Candy|GO}}, even if it is not {{OBP|trade|GO}}d.
* Gimmighoul is heavily associated with the number 999: 
** Its [[List of Pokémon by National Pokédex number|National Pokédex number]] is #0999.
** It evolves when leveled up while the player has 999 [[Gimmighoul Coin]]s.
** It was first teased through a website with a counter that periodically counted to 999.
** A promotional video about Gimmighoul tells the tale of a Gimmighoul who manipulated a young girl to fill its chest with 999 coins.<ref name="GimmighoulYT" />
* Due to its Ghost type, Roaming Form Gimmighoul's {{a|Run Away}} [[Ability]] is redundant unless its [[type change]]s, such as via {{Tera}}stallization or {{m|Soak}}.
* Gimmighoul only learns 2 moves by level-up, the fewest of all Ghost-type Pokémon.
* It is not possible to [[Escape|flee]] from a Chest Form Gimmighoul; even if the player's Pokémon is a {{t|Ghost}} type or is faster. Attempting to flee via pressing the "Run" option or use a Pokémon with the {{a|Run Away}} Ability will give the "''You can't escape!''" message. Using the [[Poké Doll]] will give the same dialogue that a player would receive if they try to use certain [[Key Item]]s such as the [[Shiny Charm]]. Using the moves {{m|Whirlwind}} or {{m|Roar}} will fail.

===Pre-release teasers===
Chest Form Gimmighoul was teased through a special website<ref name="Chest">[http://web.archive.org/web/0/https://chest.pokemon.com/ Earliest archive of https://chest.pokemon.com/]</ref> that went live on November 5, 2022 at 13:00 UTC. It showcased Gimmighoul's chest and a counter, which periodically ticked upwards every few hours as it was slowly filled with coins. The counter eventually capped out at 999 on November 6, 2022 at 14:00 UTC, and the site became a redirect to a new page on the {{g|Scarlet and Violet}} website.<ref>"[https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-us/chest-research/ Investigations into a Newly Discovered Pokémon Are Under Way!]" — Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet | Official Website</ref>

Roaming Form Gimmighoul was also teased on November 5, 2022, appearing in Pokémon GO after the {{p|Dratini}} [[Community Day|Community Day Classic]] event ended. Golden [[PokéStop]]s were added to the game, and spinning one would cause a Roaming Form Gimmighoul to show up and follow the player for a short time, although it could not be properly encountered or caught.

Prior to the release of its teasers, an obscured Roaming Form Gimmighoul could be seen very briefly in the English version of the "Jump into a Paldean Journey" trailer for {{g|Scarlet and Violet}}, posted on October 6, 2022.<ref>"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YEEDqke-D0&t=573s Jump into a Paldean Journey | Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet]." [https://www.youtube.com/c/pokemon The Official Pokémon YouTube Channel]. ''YouTube''.</ref> It does not appear in the Japanese version of this trailer.

As indicated by its English name, Gimmighoul may be based on the {{wp|ghoul}}, a mythical creature from Arabic folklore known for luring people into deserted places before preying on them, and stealing coins. The word ''ghoul'' (Arabic: غُول ''ghūl'') stems from the Arabic word غَالَ ''ghāla'', meaning "to seize". Gimmighoul's antennae and tail resemble {{wp|dowsing|dowsing rods}}, which are believed to be able to help people locate buried treasures. The association of a ghost with coins, as well as its eyes resembling coins, may also draw inspiration from {{wp|Charon's obol}}, where the deceased are buried with coins as a preparation for the afterlife. The coins were frequently placed in the mouth or on the eyes.

Gimmighoul's Chest Form may be based on the {{wp|Mimic (Dungeons & Dragons)|mimic}}, a monster archetype commonly found in RPGs, known for disguising itself as treasure chests. Its Roaming Form may be based on the Catalan folktale of {{wp|Patufet}}, a tiny child who carries a coin. It may also be based on the {{wp|toyol}} (also known as ''tuyul''), an infant-like spirit from Indonesian and Malay folklore invoked to steal riches from people. Gimmighoul's association with the number 999 may be a reference to {{wp|Fineness#Gold|999 fine gold}}, equivalent to 24 karat gold.

Considering its Evolution, Gimmighoul's design may also draw inspiration from {{wp|El Dorado}}, a legend now believed to originate in Spanish conception of {{wp|Muisca}} rituals performed in pre-colonial {{wp|Colombia}}. Its laminated body shape resembles {{wp|tunjo}}s, Muisca figurines made of molded gold in the shape of divine humans or animals. Its Ghost type could be based on the fact that tunjos are commonly found in burial places and places of worship.

====Name origin====
Gimmighoul may be a combination of ''gimme'' (informal pronunciation of "give me"), ''gimmick'', ''mimic'', and ''ghoul''. Altogether, it sounds like the phrase "Give me gold."

Collecurei may be a combination of ''collect'', 霊 ''rei'' (spirit), and a pun on the phrase これくれ ''kore kure'' ("Give me this").
