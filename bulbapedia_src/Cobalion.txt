'''Cobalion''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''コバルオン''' ''Cobalon'') is a dual-type {{2t|Steel|Fighting}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced in [[Generation V]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any Pokémon.

Along with {{p|Terrakion}}, {{p|Virizion}}, and {{p|Keldeo}}, Cobalion is a member of the [[Swords of Justice]] and is typically considered the group's [[Legendary leader|leader]]. In the {{pkmn|movie}} ''[[M15|Kyurem VS. The Sword of Justice]]'', they are also associated with {{p|Kyurem}}.

The [[Paradox Pokémon]] {{p|Iron Crown}} is said to be either a future relative of Cobalion or a counterpart of it from a parallel timeline.

==Biology==
[[File:Cobalion Sacred Sword Adventures.png|thumb|left|200px|Cobalion creating a blade while using {{m|Sacred Sword}}]]
Cobalion is a quadrupedal {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} that possesses traits of stags and goats. It is covered in aqua blue fur and has jagged yellow horns similar in shape to thunderbolts. Its snout is a lighter shade of blue than the rest of its fur, and there is a black blaze running from its nose to the back of its head. On its long neck and hind legs, there are small gray spots. It has a white tuft of fur under its neck, resembling a cravat. On its shoulder blades are yellow protrusions that resemble fins. Its tail resembles these protrusions, albeit in the same color as its snout. Cobalion's legs have black bands with lighter fur underneath and large black hooves. Cobalion's body is said to be made of steel.

According to legend, Cobalion, alongside the other [[Swords of Justice]] had challenged the [[human]]s in order to protect other Pokémon from losing their homes to humanity's expansion. During the battle, Cobalion ushered the other Pokémon to safety. The three Swords distrust humans because of a war that resulted in a forest fire in [[Moor of Icirrus]]. Its glare can make even an unruly Pokémon obey it. Cobalion is said to have possessed the air of a leader since its birth, and is capable of calming even the most vicious of foes. As seen in both [[Pokémon the Series]] and [[Pokémon Adventures]], it can create an {{m|Sacred Sword|energy blade}} out of its head. Cobalion loves [[Cobalion Treat]]s made by [[Snacksworth]], who once encountered and followed it in the past. Cobalion shares a resemblance to {{p|Iron Crown}}, which is believed to be a descendant of Cobalion or a cutting-edge weapon that merely resembles it.

In [[Generation V]], {{m|Sacred Sword}} was its [[signature move]].{{left clear}}

==Game data==
===NPC appearances===
* [[Pokémon Rumble Blast]]: Cobalion is the main antagonist for most of the game as he and his forces have been going around stealing [[Glowdrop]]s from the towns for their own selfish reasons. It is later revealed he was gathering the Glowdrops to gain entrance into the now rusted World Axle, which takes a heavy toll on his legion as they all rust. With his forces now consumed by [[Dark Rust]], Cobalion teams up with the player to infiltrate the World Axle, and ultimately defeats Dark Rust. After the player has defeated {{p|Terrakion}} and {{p|Virizion}}, they will be rewarded with this Cobalion who will be {{pkmn2|Rusty}}.

==Trivia==
* Of the [[Swords of Justice]], Cobalion is the only one with:
** A type immunity.
** A double resistance.
** An English name that is different from the official romanization of its Japanese name.
** French and German names that differ from each other.
* Cobalion's {{stat|Defense}} and {{stat|Special Defense}} stats are the reverse of {{p|Virizion}}'s, while their other stats are identical.
* Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion were all designed by [[Takao Unno]].<ref name=ND204>''Nintendo Dream'' Vol. 204, April 2011 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110704155314/http://shellspider.blog101.fc2.com/blog-entry-502.html Shellspider's blog (Japanese)], [http://lavacutcontent.com/ken-sugimori-nintendo-dream-2/ Translation by Dr. Lava])</ref>

===Origin===
Cobalion is based on the character of {{wp|Athos (character)|Athos}} from the novel ''{{wp|The Three Musketeers}}''.<ref name=ND204 /> Like Athos, Cobalion is the oldest and the ''de facto'' leader of the group. Appearance wise, like the others of its quartet, it resembles certain {{wp|ungulate}}s, most notably the {{wp|markhor}} (a type of goat), the {{wp|Deer|stag}}, and some species of antelopes such as the {{wp|greater kudu}} or {{wp|common eland}}. Like the other members of its trio, its nose is shaped like that of a {{wp|sheep}} or {{wp|goat}}.

Cobalion's Steel typing may reference Athos's title of "Count de la Fère", punning on ''fer'', French for iron.

====Name origin====
Cobalion and Cobalon may be combinations of ''cobalt'' (referring to {{wp|cobalt|the metal}} and the color of {{wp|cobalt blue}}) and ''stallion'' or ''champion''.
