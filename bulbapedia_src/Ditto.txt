'''Ditto''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''メタモン''' ''Metamon'') is a {{type|Normal}} {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} introduced in [[Generation I]].

It is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any other Pokémon.

Ditto is well known for its unique ability to [[Pokémon breeding|breed]] with any Pokémon other than the Pokémon in the {{egg|No Eggs Discovered}} group and other Ditto, including some [[Gender unknown|gender-unknown]] Pokémon, to produce Eggs of the other's species.

[[Ditto (Pokopia)|Ditto]] is the main protagonist of the upcoming [[Pokémon Pokopia]].

==Biology==
In its natural state, Ditto is a light-purple or pink blob-like {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} with {{wp|Vestigiality|vestigial}} facial features. It is often referred to as amorphous, but has a relatively consistent appearance in official artwork, including two small nubs on its "head", a few soft lumps at its base, and two {{wp|Pseudopodia|pseudopod}}-like protrusions in place of arms. The face consists of beady eyes and a simple mouth; almost always pulled into a smile.

Ditto bears a variety of unusual and often entirely unique traits that set it apart from every other Pokémon. It is capable of [[Ditto transformations|transforming]] into an exact replica of any physical object or living creature, including its form and properties. Each Ditto has its own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to transforming; being unable to remain transformed while laughing and getting details of its transformation wrong if based on memory being apparently universal. The [[Bandai Pokémon Carddass Cards]] depict Ditto being able to transform separate sections of its body into parts from multiple Pokémon at once. Similarly, in [[Pokémon Pokopia]], Ditto can transform parts of its body even while transformed as a [[human]], such as transforming its arms into {{p|Bulbasaur}}'s vines to use {{m|Leafage}}. In the ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' episodes ''[[EP037|Ditto's Mysterious Mansion]]'' and ''[[SM046|Deceiving Appearances!]]'', as well as in the [[Ditto (TCG)|TCG]] and some {{spin-off games}}, it is shown that occasionally Ditto cannot change its face during transformation; this trait has become synonymous with the species, despite being incongruous with their depiction in the [[core series]] games. While its transformation ability allows it to get along with almost anything, it does not get along with its own kind, which it will quickly (and generally fruitlessly) attempt to transform into. 

While Ditto can transform into a [[human]], it cannot mimic human speech. It transforms into a rock when sleeping to avoid being attacked. As mentioned in {{g|Sleep}}, Ditto is known to sleep while still transformed into either a rock or Pokémon.<ref>[[Sleep style|Sleep Style Dex]]</ref> On very rare occasions, a sleeping Ditto will transform back to normal when it is relaxed. In [[The Indigo Disk]], various [[Blueberry Quest|Ditto Blocks]]<ref name=DittoBlock>[https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/_images/news/dec_23/p10_03_en.jpg Screenshot from the SV website showing a quest with a Ditto Block.]</ref> can be found as objectives in [[Blueberry Quest]]s throughout the [[Terarium]], where Ditto will seemingly transform into one of the many cubes with rounded edges that make up many of the structures of the Terarium. Despite being milestones for the player to obtain, and not actually obtainable themselves, they can still be {{Shiny}}.<ref name=ShinyDittoBlock>[https://twitter.com/jflash727/status/1735463386895270079 A player finding a Shiny Ditto block in the Terarium.]</ref>

Ditto is never far from {{DL|List of Pokémon by habitat|Urban Pokémon|civilization or people}}, and is the only Pokémon capable of using the [[Metal Powder]] and [[Quick Powder]] items. It is also the [[Signature Ability|only known Pokémon]] that can have {{a|Imposter}} as an [[Ability]].

Ditto first became available in {{g|GO}} on November 23, 2016, disguised as other {{OBP|Pokémon|species}} in the {{pkmn2|wild}}. Players will only find out whether a Pokémon is a Ditto if successfully [[caught Pokémon|captured]], upon which a cutscene will show the Pokémon transforming back into Ditto.<ref>[https://pokemongolive.com/en/post/ditto/ Ditto has been discovered... - Pokémon GO]</ref> Ditto can be used in {{OBP|Gym|GO}} and {{OBP|Raid Battle|GO}}s, in which it will Transform into the first Pokémon it sees; however Ditto cannot be used in {{OBP|Trainer Battle|GO}}s.

As of September 1, 2021, wild Ditto may be Shiny, and some Pokémon whose [[Shiny Pokémon (GO)|Shiny forms]] are available may transform into Ditto. If a player encounters a Shiny Pokémon in the wild, it cannot be a disguised Ditto, but non-Shiny Pokémon have a small chance of being a Shiny Ditto.<ref>[https://pokemongohub.net/post/guide/how-does-shiny-ditto-work-in-pokemon-go/ How Does Shiny Ditto Work in Pokémon GO? | Pokémon GO Hub]</ref>

As of December 11, 2023, wild Ditto may be disguised as any of the following species:<ref>(December 1, 2023). [https://pokemongolive.com/post/adamant-time-kanto-event/ Catch up in time for the Adamant Time event, and party up in a Kanto comeback!]</ref>

== In animation==
[[File:Narissa Ditto.png|250px|thumb|{{Shiny}} and normal-colored Ditto in {{aniseries|DP}}]]
===Major appearances===
====[[Duplica's Ditto]]====
[[Duplica]] has a Ditto that debuted in ''[[EP037|Ditto's Mysterious Mansion]]'', where they used to perform for people, only to lack an audience since people saw that Ditto could not change its face. Ditto fixed that problem near the end of the episode, when it was captured by {{TRT}}.

====Other====
In ''[[EP111|Hello Pummelo]]'', {{OBP|Drake|Orange League}} used a Ditto in a [[Full Battle]] against {{Ash}} at the [[Pummelo Stadium]]. It faced [[Ash's Pikachu]], but ended up losing after Pikachu used {{m|Agility}} and then slammed its tail down on Ditto.

Sometime before ''[[EP174|Imitation Confrontation]]'', Duplica found another Ditto, which she [[nickname]]d Mini-Dit. This second Ditto could transform into an exact mirror image of anything, but it could not change its size.

In ''[[AG083|Unfair Weather Friends]]'', a Ditto was [[Brodie]]'s partner-in-crime. It reappeared in the same role in ''[[AG119|The Ribbon Cup Caper]]''.

A Ditto appeared in [[PK15]].

In ''[[DP173|Dealing With A Fierce Double Ditto Drama!]]'', [[Narissa]] used two Ditto nicknamed Ditto 1 and Ditto 2. Ditto 2 is {{DL|List of alternately colored Pokémon in animation|Ditto 2|Shiny}}.

In ''[[SM046|Deceiving Appearances!]]'', five Ditto were getting vaccinated at [[Aether Paradise]]. One of them escaped but was soon rescued. One of them reappeared in a flashback in ''[[SM047|A Masked Warning!]]''. All of them reappeared in ''[[SM096|Don't Ignore the Small Stufful!]]''.

In ''[[M21|The Power of Us]]'', [[Margo]] befriended a Ditto. It and a {{p|Teddiursa}} were targeted by [[Pokémon hunter]]s looking for {{OBP|Zeraora|M21}}, but they were saved by Zeraora, {{OBP|Ash Ketchum|M20|Ash}}, and his friends.

In ''[[JN019|A Talent for Imitation!]]'', a Ditto works as a film actor because {{m|Transform}} is unusually efficient for impersonations. Its latest role was in a movie directed by [[Kublock]], about {{p|Gardevoir}} twins, but it ran away due to Kublock's overly strict attitude and its increasing inability to use Transform as effectively. Ditto eventually ran into and befriended Team Rocket, who taught it how to overcome its nerves and regain its confidence. As a result, it returned to the set and production resumed without any further problems.

===Minor appearances===
In ''[[EP122|Flower Power]]'', a Ditto was part of [[Florando]]'s annual [[Pokémon Exhibition]].

In a flashback in ''[[EP129|Ignorance is Blissey]]'', a Ditto was at the [[Pokémon Nurse School]].

In ''[[AG015|Gonna Rule The School!]]'', the [[Pokémon Trainers' School]] lent a Ditto to the school's underage students for use in lessons.

A Ditto appeared in the opening sequence of ''[[M08|Lucario and the Mystery of Mew]]''.

A Ditto appeared in ''[[XY001|Kalos, Where Dreams and Adventures Begin!]]''.

A {{pkmn|Trainer}}'s Ditto appeared in ''[[XY138|The First Day of the Rest of Your Life!]]''.

A Trainer's Ditto appeared in ''[[M20|I Choose You!]]''.

In ''[[SM131|The Battlefield of Truth and Love!]]'', a Trainer's Ditto watched the {{pkmn|battle}}s of the [[Manalo Conference]]. It reappeared in ''[[SM133|Battling on the Wing!]]''.

In ''[[JN001|Enter Pikachu!]]'', {{an|Mew}} transformed into a Ditto during a fantasy while {{an|Professor Oak}} was teaching [[Goh]] and [[Chloe]].

In ''[[JN050|A Pinch of This, a Pinch of That!]]'', two Ditto were in the [[Wild Area]].

A Trainer's Ditto appeared in ''[[JN125|Whittle While You Work!]]''.

A Ditto appeared in ''[[JN136|This Could be the Start of Something Big!]]''.

A {{tc|Student}}'s Ditto appeared in [[HZ101]].

Multiple Ditto appeared in ''[[PT04|Wait for Me, Magikarp!]]''.

==In the manga==
[[File:Duplica Ditto EToP.png|thumb|200px|Ditto in [[The Electric Tale of Pikachu]]]]
===The Electric Tale of Pikachu ===
{{main|Duplica's Ditto}}
[[Duplica]] and her Ditto appeared in ''[[ET07|Pikachu's Excellent Adventure]]''. Finding Ditto appealing, {{an|Misty}} decided to capture one of her own, but the plan was called off when {{AP|Pikachu|Pikachu (EToP)}} went missing.

Ditto was also featured in a minicomic, in which it transformed into [[Ash Ketchum (EToP)|Ash]], harassed Misty, and thereby got Ash into a lot of pain.

Ditto was the first Pokémon {{OBP|Drake|Orange League}} used against Ash in ''[[ET17|The Orange Crew Supreme Gym Leader]]''.

===Magical Pokémon Journey===
{{main|Master Ditto}}
In [[Magical Pokémon Journey]], there is a ninja master named Master Ditto who appears several times in the manga. His first appearance is in ''[[PPP13|The Wal Comes Tumbling Down]]''.

===={{MangaArc|Red, Green & Blue}}====
{{main|Ditty}}
In ''[[PS016|Tauros the Tyrant]]'', Ditto is one of the members on {{adv|Green}}'s team. As a master of transformation, Green uses Ditto extensively in her schemes, such as morphing over her face to disguise her appearance (like when she infiltrated the [[Silph Co.]] building disguised as [[Sabrina]]), camouflaging into its background for subterfuge, as well as forming a protective shield with Green's umbrella.

===={{MangaArc|Gold, Silver & Crystal}}====
A {{pkmn|Trainer}}'s Ditto appeared in ''[[PS107|Gligar Glide]]'', where it was seen in the [[Goldenrod Game Corner]].

Ditto is seen later used by [[Team Rocket]] in ''[[PS127|Miltank Melee]]'', to lure {{adv|Crystal}} and [[Eusine]] away from {{p|Suicune}} and smother them when discovered. It was, however, defeated by Crystal's {{p|Hitmonchan}}, [[Monlee]].

{{main|Ditto (TCG)}}

==Other appearances==
===[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]===
[[File:Ditto Melee.png|right|thumb|A screenshot of Ditto in Melee]]
Ditto was originally intended to be one of the Pokémon randomly released from a {{i|Poké Ball}}. It would have transformed into a copy of the user's character and aided them in battle. However, it was removed for unknown reasons before the game's release. Ditto can still be unlocked through the debug menu (which is only accessible through the use of Action Replay), though it does not do anything other than deal 7-8% damage to those who touch it.

As for its official status, Ditto only appears as a random trophy and as a cameo in the Tournament Mode menu. In Winner Out or Loser Out tournaments, holding down L and R and pressing A will give the player a random character and color for each match. The usual character image will instead be a picture of Ditto.

====Trophy information ====
''Every Ditto has the ability to copy a Pokémon's entire cell structure in an instant and become its exact replica. They're terrible at remembering techniques, but when they use {{m|Transform}}, they temporarily learn all of their foe's moves. If a Ditto starts to laugh, it weakens and can't hold its transformation.''

===[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]===
[[File:SSB Ditto.png|thumb|250px|Ditto in [[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]]]
Ditto appears as a Pokémon summoned from the {{i|Poké Ball}}, where it uses {{m|Transform}} to duplicate the shape of the summoning character while still maintaining its own color. It then attacks opposing fighters. Ditto also appears as a {{sbw|Spirit}}.

{{spoilers}}
A Ditto appeared in {{DetPikMov}}, under the ownership of [[Howard Clifford]]. For the majority of the movie, it assumed a human disguise known as Ms. Norman, but this was eventually uncovered during the final battle at [[Ryme City]].

==Trivia ==
[[File:Spr 2d 188.png|thumb|Sprite of Animon from the 1997 demo]] 
*Ditto has a scrapped Evolution in the [[Pokémon Gold and Silver Spaceworld '97 demo|1997 Nintendo Space World demo]] of Pokémon Gold and Silver named アニモン ''Animon'', which evolves from Ditto using a [[Metal Coat]].
*Ditto is the only Pokémon to date with a [[catch rate]] of 35. However, in Generations [[Generation III|III]] and [[Generation IV|IV]], if Ditto {{m|transform}}s into another Pokémon, its catch rate will become that of the new Pokémon. In [[Generation IX]], its catch rate will become 0 by mistake if the Pokémon is not the primary [[form]], [[List of Pokémon with gender differences|gender]] (for Pokémon with differing stats or movesets), or [[regional form]].
* Ditto and {{p|Manaphy}} are the only Pokémon that are both able to breed yet unobtainable through breeding.
* In [[Pokémon Snap]], Ditto takes the form of {{p|Bulbasaur}} in the {{OBP|Cave|Snap}} stage. The {{player}} can cause them to return to their Ditto form by hitting them with an object. When the player takes their picture, Ditto has the same eyes when it is transformed as when it is not. This trait is shared by [[Duplica]]'s Ditto in the ''[[Pokémon the Series]]'' episode ''[[EP037|Ditto's Mysterious Mansion]]'', although it was understood that this was not natural. {{TCG|Ditto|Ditto cards}} from the {{TCG|EX Delta Species}} {{Trading Card Game}} expansion, the Clefairy Ditto that may appear in the [[Veilstone Game Corner]]'s slot machines, and [[Howard Clifford]]'s Ditto in {{DetPikMov}} also have this trait.
*Ditto is one of two Pokémon to have two different species-specific [[Stat-enhancing item]]s associated with it, the other being {{p|Clamperl}}. Ditto's two associated items, the Metal Powder and Quick Powder, seem to be the same colors as Ditto's normal and {{Shiny}} forms, respectively.
*In [[Pokémon Rumble]], since {{m|Transform}} was not programmed into the game, Ditto can only know {{m|Struggle}}. Since PP does not exist in Rumble, this makes Ditto the only Pokémon in Rumble that can use Struggle. However, Transform does exist in [[Pokémon Rumble Blast]], so Ditto has a move from that game onward.
*Ditto is the most common Pokémon in [[Pokémon Trozei!]], appearing in every area. This is due to its ability to transform, enabling the player a way to advance further if no links are available before Ditto appears.
*Prior to [[Generation VI]], Ditto and {{p|Poliwag}} had the same [[cry]].
*Since Transform copies its target's stats (except HP), Ditto cannot utilize its Special Attack stat before Transforming, though it can use its Attack stat for {{m|Struggle}} and {{status|confusion}} damage.
* Since Ditto's only move, Transform, cannot copy moves in the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon series and has only one PP, its only move after transforming is Struggle.
**However, in [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team|Red/Blue Rescue Team]] and in [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time and Explorers of Darkness|Explorers of Time, Darkness]], and [[Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky|Sky]], a player-controlled Ditto can learn the TM moves [[Vacuum-Cut]] and [[Wide Slash]].
**Since [[Pokémon Super Mystery Dungeon]], Ditto is able to get the moveset of the target Pokémon when it transforms.
*In Generation VI, Ditto is only given one move animation (despite the two animations minimum most Pokémon have for contact and non-contact moves).
*On October 4, 2017, [[The Pokémon Company]] posted a Ditto-themed music video onto their YouTube channel titled [[Dit-to Ditto]].
*In [[Pokémon GO]], Ditto appears in the wild disguised as other Pokémon. After being caught, it will reveal its true form. At one point, a large amount of Ditto were seen disguised as the then-unrevealed [[Mythical Pokémon]], {{p|Meltan}}.
*In Pokémon GO, Ditto and {{p|Shedinja}} are the only Pokémon that cannot be used in [[Trainer Battle (GO)|Trainer Battles]], unless the battle is against [[Team GO Rocket]].
*Ditto is the only non-playable Pokémon that can be defeated in [[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]].
*In {{g|Shuffle}}, Ditto was originally coded as a wildcard prior to its official release, allowing it to match with any other Pokémon icon - its effect from {{g|Battle Trozei}}. This was not a {{OBP|skill|Shuffle}} effect (as its skill was {{DL|Skill (Shuffle)|Swarm}}), but rather a quality specific to Ditto itself. Some players obtained Ditto illegitimately during this time, and used its effect to gain high scores in [[competitive stage]]s from September 2015 until Ditto's official release in 2017, when the skill was changed to Shuffle's version of {{DL|Skill (Shuffle)|Transform}}.<ref>[https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonShuffle/comments/3lyk41/explaining_the_significance_of_ditto_spoilers/ "Explaining the significance of Ditto" - MikoUK - Reddit]</ref>
* Ditto is the only [[Generation I]] Pokémon that does not have evolutionary relatives, an alternate form (such as a [[regional variant]], [[Gigantamax]] form, or [[Mega Evolution]]), or a strong association with another Pokémon that it does not share an evolutionary line with (like the [[Mew duo]]).
*Ditto has the most [[sleep style]]s of any Pokémon, with a total of 11.

===Glitches===
====Index 000 post-capture====
In [[Generation I]], if the player manages to capture an [['M (00)]], it will still be in battle with the player, and the battle will not end. Catching 'M (00) again results in the second one becoming a Ditto of the same level.

===Origin ===
{{Bulbanews|Unused Pokémon design revealed in magazine interview}}
In the sixth issue of {{wp|Best Buy}}'s @Gamer magazine, Game Freak developers [[Junichi Masuda]] and [[Ken Sugimori]] revealed that Ditto was originally based on the iconic {{wp|smiley}} face. Its eyes and mouth are exactly like ":)", which is an emoticon representing the smiley.

Additionally, Ditto strongly resembles an ''{{wp|amoeba}}'', a single-celled organism with no definite shape. This may emphasize its ability to alter its cellular composition. This could also explain why Ditto is unavailable through breeding, since single-celled organisms reproduce differently from multi-cellular plants and animals. It also could partially be based on an {{wp|Cellular differentiation|undifferentiated cell}}, a cell in the body that can change into any other cell by sampling it. In addition, it could have been based on a {{wp|blob}} or {{wp|modeling clay}}.

Ditto's ability to change into other beings is reminiscent of a variety of mythical creatures like {{wp|changeling}}s, {{wp|doppelgänger}}s, or {{wp|skin-walker}}s.

====Name origin====
Ditto is literally ''ditto'' (that which was stated before; copy of a document; imitation).

Metamon may be a combination of ''metamorphose'' (to undergo a physical transformation) or ''meta-'' (prefix meaning "encompassing" or "transcending", which may refer to {{m|Transform}} allowing Ditto to take on the shape of every other Pokémon) and ''monster''.
