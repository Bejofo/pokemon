'''Enamorus''' ([[List of Japanese Pokémon names|Japanese]]: '''ラブトロス''' ''Lovetolos'') is a dual-type {{2t|Fairy|Flying}} [[Legendary Pokémon]] introduced during [[Generation VIII]], in {{g|Legends: Arceus}}.

While it is not known to [[Evolution|evolve]] into or from any Pokémon, Enamorus has a second [[#Form data|form]] activated by using the [[Reveal Glass]]. Its original form, '''Incarnate Forme''', will then become '''Therian Forme'''.

Along with {{p|Tornadus}}, {{p|Thundurus}}, and {{p|Landorus}}, it is a member of the [[forces of nature]].

==Biology==
[[File:EnamorusTwilightMasquerade93.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Enamorus's tail uncoils, glows pink, and takes the shape of a heart during attacks]]
In Incarnate Forme, Enamorus is a pink, slim humanoid {{OBP|Pokémon|species}}, which resembles a genie. It is a female-only species with no male counterpart. On its forehead are four sharp magenta horns. Enamorus has white hair tied back, with thick strands shaped like a heart on top of its head, white lips, and two pointed pink ears on either side of its head with a small strand of hair falling in front of them from the temples. Its eyes are yellow with beady white irises and no visible pupils. The front of Enamorus's body is covered in magenta spots, most of them shaped like diamonds, pebbles, and {{wp|magatama}}s. Its thin chest consists of two joined diamond-shaped pectorals, its shoulders are adorned with magatama shapes, and on top of its navel is a teardrop, all colored magenta. It has two spotted thin arms, with five fingers on each hand. Its lower body consists of a trailing cloud, with a long, brown tail resembling a snake wrapped twice around its neck. Enamorus's tail has magenta heart markings lined in black running its span, with a pair in place at the end of its tail resembling eyes and another resembling a mouth.

Enamorus is known as the "Herald of Spring" and "God of Spring". The reason is that it arrived from the sea into [[Hisui]]. Enamorus's love was said to have given rise to fresh life in Hisui. This usually signals the end of winter and the rise of the spring season as it does not like the cold. It can unleash mini hearty whirlwinds along with surrounding itself with a wind shield to protect itself from harm. It attacks by wrapping the target in {{m|Springtide Storm|fierce winds brimming with love and hate}}. It remains in its Incarnate Forme while residing in a [[region]].

Enamorus is the [[Signature move|only known Pokémon]] capable of learning the move {{m|Springtide Storm}}.

===Forms===
Enamorus has two forms: Incarnate Forme and Therian Forme.

In Therian Forme, Enamorus resembles a flying cloud turtle and snake hybrid Pokémon. The feet are magenta three-toe flippers connected to pink arms with single magenta, magatama-shaped spots on the front legs. The trailing cloud now rings its body, leaving bare its pink belly, with the end having a small cloud tail; its belly has a green gem where its navel should lie. The long, brown snake-like tail is coiled on the cloud body, acting as the top of its shell; the false snake head remains, as do the heart-shaped markings along it. Its pink head now resembles a long-nosed turtle, with a long neck that protrudes directly from the cloud ring. Enamorus retains the four magenta horns on its forehead, but they are stubbier. The tip of its nose is white and heart-shaped, connected to a curved white mustache that extends to both sides of its nose. It retains its yellow eyes with beady white irises and short white hair resembling a hair bun with strands shaped like a heart on top.

Enamorus's Therian Forme is its true form, which is only revealed by the [[Reveal Glass]]. It is known to be vengeful to those who disrespect any form of life, descending from the clouds to deliver a wrathful, ruthless punishment. It is known to travel around oceans in this form in search of a region to reside in. In this form, it is known to inhabit the [[Interdream Zone]].

===Form data===
Enamorus has two interchangeable forms: Incarnate Forme and Therian Forme. By default, Enamorus is in its Incarnate Forme. When exposed to the [[Reveal Glass]], it changes into its Therian Forme; if exposed to the Reveal Glass again, it reverts to its Incarnate Forme. The two forms have different [[base stats]], {{Abilities}}, and [[cry|cries]]. Its Therian Forme only has one possible Ability, despite its Incarnate Forme also having a Hidden Ability.

==Trivia==
* Enamorus is the only member of the [[forces of nature]] to be female.
* Despite being a {{type|Flying}} Pokémon, Enamorus cannot learn any Flying-type moves by leveling up. This is also true with Thundurus and Landorus.
* Enamorus is the only Pokémon introduced in [[Pokémon Legends: Arceus]] to not evolve from a previously introduced Pokémon. However, it is a member of a previously introduced group of [[Legendary Pokémon]], the Forces of Nature.
* Enamorus is the only Legendary Pokémon to close out a [[generation]]'s [[National Pokédex]] listing, since every prior generation's listing closes with a [[Mythical Pokémon]] instead.
* In {{g|Legends: Arceus}}'s internal code, Incarnate Forme Enamorus's Ability is {{a|Healer}} instead of {{a|Cute Charm}}.
* Enamorus is the only Pokémon who can have Cute Charm naturally as an Ability that cannot learn {{m|Attract}}.
* Incarnate Forme Enamorus is the only Legendary Pokémon introduced during [[Generation VIII]] to have a [[Hidden Ability]].
* Enamorus is the only Pokémon that can only be caught in [[Hisui]]an [[Poké Ball]]s in the main series. However, it can be obtained in various balls in {{g|GO}}, and can be obtained in a [[Cherish Ball]] in [[Pokémon HOME]].
** As this Cherish Ball Enamorus's [[game of origin]] is Pokémon Legends: Arceus, it is the only Pokémon that can originate from said game without being in a Hisuian Poké Ball, and the only one that can originate from said game without being in a [[Strange Ball]] in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
*** This also means that this Enamorus is the only Pokémon that can originate from Pokémon Legends: Arceus and be contained in a Strange Ball within said game.
* Enamorus is the first {{t|Fairy}}/{{t|Flying}} type to debut with this type combination, as {{p|Togetic}} and {{p|Togekiss}} were Normal/Flying in their debut.

===Origin===
In Incarnate Forme, Enamorus may be based on {{wp|Ugajin}}, a harvest and fertility ''{{wp|kami}}'' represented with the body of a snake and the head of a man or woman. Enamorus appears to be based on the female deity, which was {{wp|Shinbutsu-shūgō|syncretized}} with {{wp|Benzaiten}}, a Japanese Buddhist deity who originated from the Hindu goddess {{wp|Saraswati}}. In addition, it may be inspired by other snake-bearing goddesses, especially {{wp|Manasa}} in Hinduism and {{wp|Bodhisattva}} Janguli in {{wp|Chinese Esoteric Buddhism}}, who symbolized the triumph over evil {{wp|Nāga|snakes or dragons}}, and were worshipped for the cure of snake venom and patronage of fertility. Its association with spring may also draw inspiration from the ancient {{wp|Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian}} goddess {{wp|Inanna}} or Ishtar, who represented the planet {{wp|Venus}} and the transition into spring in {{wp|Babylonian astrology}}.

Like the other members of the [[forces of nature]], it may also have drawn some inspiration from {{wp|djinn}} or an {{wp|Anemoi}}. For the latter it may be specifically inspired by the west wind {{wp|Zephyrus}}, who is associated with flowers, the springtime, and procreation, which is shown in the Pokémon's ability to bring life and its signature move, {{m|Springtide Storm}}. It also shares similarities with the {{wp|Maya civilization|Mayan}} depiction of {{wp|Kukulkan}} at {{wp|Yaxchilan}}. The way Enamorus's snake-like tail is wrapped around its neck may be a reference to {{wp|constriction}}, a hunting method used by snakes, or to the {{wp|feather boa}}, an accessory worn around the neck.

In Therian Forme, Enamorus may be based on reptiles, namely a {{wp|softshell turtle}} and a snake. It may also draw inspiration from the {{wp|Black Tortoise}} (Chinese: 玄武 ''Xuánwǔ'') of the {{wp|Four Symbols|Chinese Four Symbols}}; like Enamorus, the Black Tortoise is usually depicted with a snake wrapped around it. However, despite Enamorus being associated with spring, the Black Tortoise represents winter. Therian Forme Enamorus's Pokédex entry, which mentions it punishing those who disrespect life, may be inspired by stories of turtle eaters being revenged by demonized softshell turtles in {{wp|Edo period|Edo}}-era literary sketches, such as ''{{wp|ja:北越奇談|Hokuetsu Kidan}}'' and ''Kaidan Tabi no Akebono''. Its form difference could also draw inspiration from the Edo-era superstition that softshell turtles are capable of shapeshifting.

In both formes, though especially Incarnate Forme, Enamorus' serpent-esque tail may also allude to [[wp:Minos|King Minos]] in the story of Dante's ''[[wp:Inferno_(Dante)|Inferno]]''. Dante depicted Minos as a serpentine man who resided in the [[wp:Second_circle_of_hell|circle of Lust]] and judged sinners by making them confess all of their sins to him, after which he would wrap his snake tail around himself a certain number of times, with said number corresponding to which ring of Hell he saw them best fit for. In both formes of Enamorus, we can see its tail wrapped around two times over, which would correspond to the circle of Lust, all befitting of its connections to love.

====Name origin====
Enamorus may be a combination of ''enamor'', ''amorous'', and ''{{wp|Aeolus}}'' (ruler of the winds in {{wp|Greek mythology}}).

Lovetolos may be a combination of ''love'' and Αἴολος ''Aiolos'' (Greek name for Aeolus). It can also be taken to mean ラブとロス ''rabu to rosu'' (love and loss).
