Bulbasaur,0001,Seed,"==Biology==
[NAME] is a small, quadrupedal amphibian Pokémon that has blue-green skin with darker patches. It has red eyes with white pupils, pointed, ear-like structures on top of its head, and a short, blunt snout with a wide mouth. Small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw when the mouth is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three sharp claws. On [NAME]'s back is a green plant bulb that conceals two slender, tentacle-like vines, which grow from a seed planted there at birth. The bulb also provides it with energy through photosynthesis and from the nutrient-rich seeds contained within.

First partner Pokémon are raised by Breeders to be distributed to new Trainers. Having been raised by humans from birth, [NAME] is regarded as both a rare and well-behaved Pokémon. It is known to be extremely loyal, even after long-term abandonment. [NAME] have demonstrated a nurturing instinct towards younger, weaker Pokémon, one individual even using its vines to pick up a crying Pokémon, gently rocking it back and forth through the air while singing a ""Bulba-by"". Its vines are long and strong enough to allow [NAME] to grab the branches of trees and pull itself up to reach berries. [NAME] can survive for days without eating. As mentioned in Sleep Style Dex, [NAME] is known to sleep in sunny spots. [NAME] has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: ''Sunbathing Sleep'', ''Sturdy Sleep'', ''Vines-Out Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''.

It is found in grasslands and forests throughout the Kanto region. However, due to [NAME]'s status as a first partner Pokémon, it is hard to come by in the wild and is generally found under the ownership of a Trainer. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy. A [NAME]'s bulb will flash blue when it is ready to evolve. If it does not want to evolve, it struggles to resist the transformation. Many [NAME] gather every year in a hidden garden in Kanto to evolve into Ivysaur in a ceremony led by a Venusaur.",Grass,Poison,Grass,,0.5,"

[NAME] has a short, rounded snout with a wide mouth and two pointed teeth in its upper jaw. Each of its feet has three claws on them. The bulb on its back has bloomed into a giant pink bud. A short brown trunk surrounded by leafy green fronds supports the bud.

The weight of the plant prevents [NAME] from running fast and standing on its hind legs, forcing its legs to grow sturdy. When its flower is ready to bloom, it gives off a distinct, sweet-smelling aroma and starts swelling. [NAME] will also start spending more time in sunlight in preparation for its upcoming Evolution. Exposure to sunlight adds to the strength of both [NAME] and its plant. As shown in Pokémon Sleep, [NAME] is known to sleep in sunny spots while undergoing its photosynthesis process. Researchers cannot decide if [NAME] is awake or asleep during this process. [NAME] has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: ''Sunbathing Sleep'', ''Sturdy Sleep'', ''Vines-Out Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''.

A female [NAME] has a gynoecium in the center of its flower.

[NAME] uses its flower to catch the sun's rays to convert them into energy, which causes the flower to become more vibrant.
