[NAME] drifts on seasonal winds and can use its spores to masterfully maneuver itself around the globe. It will spread cotton spores as it floats around to create offspring; inhaling these spores may cause coughs and itchiness. It descends if it encounters cold air currents while it is floating.

Despite appearing very sluggish, [NAME] will not be reluctant to attack if angered and can be quite fast.

[NAME] attempts to make itself look larger and more intimidating by cinching its waist with its forked tail. It barges into the nests of other Pokemon and frightens them off so [NAME] can claim the nest as its own. It does this by glaring with its eyes ceaselessly. It can be found in both urban areas and heavily wooded forests. Despite its disrespectful and scary nature, [NAME] is rather popular. The reason is due to its beautiful fur, more comfortable than even velveteen.

It creates ice inside its body by drinking water and then expels it to hide itself or freeze opponents, whose lives it spares after freezing because it is kind-natured. Its icy breath can reach temperatures of −148&nbsp;°F (−100&nbsp;°C). It can shatter frozen opponents with powerful headbutts. [NAME] are smaller in hotter regions and elusive on warm, sunny days, and although it is possible to refreeze its body despite melting, this process can leave its appearance warped.",Ice,,Ice,,1.0,0,"[""Ice""]",485,73,558

When its mouth is open, two pointed teeth can be seen on its upper jaw. Its tail is fluffy and slightly curled.

[NAME]'s ears are quite large in proportion to its body and folded. Beneath its ears are two ring-shaped yellow organs. These organs emit [NAME]'s intense psychic powers. It has no control over its power, and it would leak out if the ears were not sheltering the organs. It has enough psychic energy to create a blast radius of 300 feet (90 meters). This psychic energy can send even a wrestler flying. While its blank expression barely changes, beneath it is an intense struggle, trying so hard to control its psychic powers.

Its eyes are round with golden irises and a mark that appears to be an eyelash extending up and back toward the rest of the body. [NAME]'s entire body is enveloped in a special membrane that can heal wounds.

[NAME] lives in the open seas. If it finds an injured Pokemon floating at sea, it will heal the Pokemon's wounds using its membrane and carry it back to shore. [NAME] does this because any predators coming for the injured Pokemon could also come for [NAME]. [NAME] swims alongside smaller Pokemon to accompany them; thus, many water Pokemon gather around it.

There is a ridge down its back with three flat spines on either side and it has a flat, pointed tail. Instead of hands, its forearms have large, sharp, gray scythes. Its thin legs are brown lead to small feet with two large gray claws.

Before it went extinct, [NAME] was in the process of evolving into a land dweller as evident by changes in its gills and legs. This change is thought to be due to its prey moving onto land as well. In its ocean home [NAME] could tuck up its limbs to help it swim extremely fast, up to roughly 29 knots. It used its sharp scythes to slice enemies and drink their internal fluids. Any leftovers left behind by [NAME] are consumed by other Pokemon. It is unknown what led to [NAME]'s extinction.",Rock,Water,Rock,Water,1.0,1,"[""Rock"", ""Water""]",495,12,507

It has large, flat ears on the sides of its head and oval, orange eyes with no pupils. On top of its head is a yellow bloom with a white center. [NAME] spreads its petals to absorb as much sunlight as possible. The bloom on top of its head opens and closes as the temperature fluctuates and its flower blossoms when the temperature rises above 64&nbsp;°F (18&nbsp;°C). Because of this, it is sometimes used as a thermometer. It floats in the air to try to get closer to the sun, but closes its flower and immediately hides under the shade of a tree when it rains. If the weather gets too cold, [NAME] will fly away and migrate to warmer regions so that it can photosynthesize. Some people claim to be able to determine a [NAME]'s birth location by the scent coming off of its flower. [NAME] lives in temperate grasslands.

These antennae are used to seek food.

[NAME] is nocturnal and is instinctively drawn to light. Swarms are attracted by the bright light of cities, where they wreak havoc by devouring the leaves off roadside trees. When attacked, [NAME] unleashes toxic scales from its wings; these toxins are powerful enough to make even a pro wrestler sick.

Carkol,838,Coal,"[NAME] is a Pokemon which resembles a minecart. It has a head with two triangular eyes and a mouth that has a warm, orange glow. Behind its head is a small heap of coal which can glow orange-red, atop a body of black stone. It has four wheel-like legs which it moves on.

[NAME] forms coal and coal tar inside of its body. Although it frequently drops its coal, the heap on [NAME]'s back never falls apart completely even when it travels at high speeds, due to the tar binding it together. People in the Galar region once used [NAME]'s coal to fuel their lives. [NAME] can move faster than 18 mph (30 km/h) and can breathe flames hotter than 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit (1,000 degrees Celsius).

It uses magnetism to move, communicate, and control its attacks. [NAME] sometimes gathers in swarms, communicating with each other telepathically and magnetically and moving in sync. When enraged, it can cause nearby machines to break from its strong magnetism. [NAME] can also use its magnetic force to rapidly pull in enemies and then use its sharp claws to harm them.

[NAME] is a mischievous Pokemon that likes to steal from people. [NAME] feels amusement from the frustration of those it steals from. It will put on a cute act in order to get its victims to let their guard down. Should this facade succeed, the victim is left with stinging scratches and broken pride from [NAME]'s laughter. However, it is often forgiven even if it is caught stealing due to its charm. When angered, it fights back with its claws.

Tropius,357,Fruit,"[NAME] is a large, sauropod-like Pokemon with a brown body wrapped in green leaves on its chest and head. It possesses large, broad green leaves on its back, which it uses for flight and for sugar production via photosynthesis. Despite being very big and bulky, it is surprisingly maneuverable in the air. It has a long neck with a thin black line around it. It uses its neck for reaching treetops to gorge on its most favored fruit. Since it ate only this kind of fruit continuously, the fruit began to grow around its neck. These yellow, banana-like fruits can be picked and consumed by other Pokemon or humans, and grow twice a year because of the rapid production of sugar in [NAME]'s leaves. Its feet have toenails the same color as its fruit.

In warm areas, there are ranches that raise [NAME]. In Alola, its fruit is especially sweet compared to those of other regions. It lives in tropical jungles.

[NAME] can launch itself at opponents. [NAME] and its evolved forms are the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Gear Grind. Prior to Generation VII, Shift Gear was also one of its signature moves. Once two bodies have joined, they cannot combine with any others or they will become separated. [NAME] generates its life energy by spinning, and is generally found in caves. According to Professor Juniper, the first recorded evidence of this Pokemon dates to around 100 years ago, in the Chargestone Cave; she believes that it suddenly appeared in the cave at that time.

A white mane of wool covers its head and upper body. This mane forms sideways curls on the top of its head. It has stubby arms and one nail on each foot. [NAME]'s long tail has black stripes and is tipped with a blue orb.

Storing too much electricity caused [NAME] to lose the wool over most of its body, but the bare, rubbery skin protects it from the electricity stored in its fleece. The quality of [NAME]'s fleece can change to generate more electricity with less wool. The orb will light up when [NAME]'s mane is fully charged, and it can attack by firing electrified hairs at opponents. [NAME] typically inhabits grassy meadows and fields, though it can also be found in farms, where its wool is used to create high-quality clothing.

Scientists believe [NAME] used to be reflective and have unsuccessfully tried performing X-rays on its body. The pattern of [NAME] in Galar cannot be found in any of its cultures, and the reason is unknown. There is lore on how polishing [NAME] will make its surface reflect the truth. However, it hates being polished. [NAME] uses an unknown energy to help it float around. It typically lives in mountainous paths.

A soothing aroma wafts from the leaf, which can calm battling Pokemon. The leaf is also used to sense temperature and humidity. [NAME] actively seeks out and enjoys the sun's warmth. As mentioned in Sleep, [NAME] uses the leaf to search for the coziest place to sleep in. On occasion, [NAME] can be seen relaxing as it sleeps due to finding a great spot. [NAME] can be found in grasslands. However, due to its status as a first partner Pokemon, a wild [NAME] is hard to come by and it is generally found under the ownership of Trainers. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy. [NAME] has a docile and gentle nature.",Grass,,Grass,Poison,0.5,0,"[""Grass"", ""Poison""]",498,77,575
Piloswine,221,Swine,"[NAME] is a big, brown, furry porcine Pokemon with an impressive hump on its back. It also has two tusks made of ice, which seem small but can be lethal. These tusks thicken when it snows, and they are smaller on a female [NAME] than on a male. It has floppy ears that are sensitive to sound. [NAME] has two beady eyes in its head; however, these are usually covered up by tufts of fur. As it is usually unable to see, it checks surroundings with its sensitive pig-like nose instead. As a result, [NAME] is constantly charging at foes when it moves. The hairs on its back stands up straight as a warning sign for this.

[NAME]'s thick fur allows it to survive in harshly cold environments that it inhabits, such as icy caves, mountainous regions and frozen tundra. Its fur is so long that it usually covers its small, hooved legs. Despite the small size of its legs, its hooves ensure even footing on icy ground. [NAME] often digs for food buried beneath snow and ice using its tusks.",Ice,Ground,Ice,Ground,1.0,1,"[""Ice"", ""Ground""]",498,76,574

Paired with its crooked downward mouth, its face is similar to a frown. It also has two big nostrils.

[NAME] has a dark yellow pouch around its neck, which it uses to store more than 17 pounds (8 kg) of sand. The pouch gets more elastic with every time [NAME] sheds its skin. [NAME] collects sand by swallowing it and shoots the sand from its nostrils, an ability it uses to blind predators so it can escape by burrowing into the ground. It also burrows into the sand in order to ambush its prey. Because [NAME]'s nostrils are specialized for shooting out sand, it has a poor sense of smell.

[NAME] and its Evolution, Sandaconda, are the only known Pokemon that can have Sand Spit as an Ability.",Ground,,Ground,,1.0,0,"[""Ground""]",500,73,573
Torkoal,324,Coal,"[NAME] is a tortoise-like, quadrupedal Pokemon. It has a large, black, rock-like shell with holes that glow with a red warmth. Its skin is reddish-brown with gray-black bands on its legs and neck. It has a long neck and its eyes seem permanently closed.

[NAME] lives in mountains and volcanic areas, where it looks for large deposits of coal. It uses the coal to fill the hollow spaces in its shell and then burns it for energy. Because coal is [NAME]'s source of energy, it becomes weak and immobile once it runs out of coal to burn. If the fire inside of [NAME]'s shell goes out, it will die. A [NAME] is healthy if the smoke spouting from its shell has tremendous velocity. When it blows out smoke from its nostrils and the top of its back, it sounds like a locomotive horn. If it is attacked, it blows black smoke out of its nostrils before fleeing. [NAME]'s shell also serves to shield it from critical blows. Prior to Generation V and in Generation IX, White Smoke is its signature Ability.",Fire,,Fire,,1.0,0,"[""Fire""]",498,73,571

It also has a small yellow nose.

[NAME] tends to be drawn to fast-moving things and will chase after people, other Pokemon, or even vehicles. [NAME] has an organ that generates electricity from the base of its tail when it runs. It cannot store the electricity it generates, so sparks of electricity can often be seen when it is running. In the Galar region, it is a popular choice for herding Pokemon such as Wooloo. Due to its gluttonous nature, it will only assist people in exchange for treats. Joltik are often seen on its hindquarters, feeding on its static electricity.

The dark blue feathers on its head extend down its back and around its neck, which causes it to appear to be wearing a cape. There are two white ovals on its chest and a small, light-blue marking resembles a crown above its beak. It has flipper-like arms and yellow feet with three toes each.

[NAME] has a strong sense of self-pride. Because of its pride, it has a hard time accepting food from humans and bonding with its caretakers. It will even puff out its chest after it falls down, which it often does due to its poor walking abilities. However, it is a skilled swimmer that can dive for over ten minutes in order to hunt. It has also been shown to fly short distances in the animated series. It lives along the seashore in colder climates. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy.

There is a small horn on its forehead, which it uses in combination with its tusks to bore through ice floes. It has two flippers on its chest, and two more on the end of its tail. When the tail is raised, it resembles a waterspout.

[NAME] lives on icebergs in frigid ocean waters. Its warm fur and thick hide allow it to swim in waters as cold as -40° Fahrenheit (-40° Celsius). It thrives in these cold environments, becoming more active as the temperature drops and tires easily in warm waters. Preferring to sleep during the day, it hunts for prey under sheets of ice in the late day and evening hours. While it is a graceful swimmer, it is awkward and struggles to move on dry land.",Water,,Ice,Water,0.5,0,"[""Ice"", ""Water""]",498,76,574
Whimsicott,547,Windveiled,"[NAME] is a small, brown, bipedal Pokemon. A mane of cotton-like fluff covers its back, neck, and forehead. Behind it is a green, star-shaped section similar to where a stem or vine meets a fruit or flower on a plant. [NAME]'s face features orange, oval-shaped eyes, and its face is flanked by a pair of green-colored lobes shaped like curled horns or ears.

[NAME] can manipulate its body to pass through cracks, no matter how narrow. It takes advantage of this ability as a notorious prankster, moving things and leaving cotton balls behind. However, should it get wet, it will be too heavy to move and answer for its pranks.

The only time that [NAME]'s eyes have been seen open was in Pokemon Adventures, during the battle between Pryce and Erika in ''Bringing up Bellossom'', when Pryce ordered his [NAME] to dodge Erika's Skiploom's attack.

[NAME] uses its pink, pig-like nose to dig through mud and snow, looking for anything edible. In Hisui, ancient people relied on [NAME] a lot because of this skill. Occasionally, it will come across hot springs while scouring the ground. Its favorite food is a type of mushroom that grows beneath dead grass, though it also eats Berries.

Inside [NAME]'s antennae are electricity-generating cells that create so much electrical power that they even make [NAME] tingle slightly. The orbs on its antennae can glow and light up from the electric current, which [NAME] uses to lure prey. It also flashes its light to communicate with others of its kind and claim territory. By discharging positive and negative electricity from the antennae, it can both defend itself and stun its prey. [NAME] lives on dark ocean floors, rarely ever coming up to the surface.

If its Trainer is in a cheerful mood, [NAME] also becomes cheerful and joyous. It is known to inhabit urban areas, but it does not normally show itself to humans. However, when it senses happy feelings, it will approach people. [NAME] prefers to hang out with people of cheerful nature more than those with gloomy natures. Regardless, [NAME] will show no discrimination to anyone based on age or gender. As mentioned in Sleep, when you see a [NAME] smiling in its sleep, that means something good has happened during that day.",Psychic,Fairy,Psychic,Fairy,1.0,1,"[""Psychic"", ""Fairy""]",517,142,659
Runerigus,867,Grudge,"[NAME] is a Pokemon composed of an oblong, irregularly-shaped clay slab, with an outline of a stylized serpent with sharp teeth painted onto it in red. Two sections of the slab at the upper left and upper right side, along with a piece bearing the serpent's head and a small piece bearing the tip of the image's tail, have broken off and are held in place by shadowy black tendrils that form its arms, neck, and tail respectively; the ""tail"" fragment also resembles the piece carried by Galarian Yamask. It has five black fingers on each hand, which extend from the ends of the fragments forming its arms. It has a single purple eye located in the same spot as the painting's eye. [NAME] seems to be distantly related to Cofagrigus.

[NAME] was formed from a painting imbued with an ancient curse, which was activated by absorbing the spirit of a Yamask and brought the painting to life. Anyone that touches its shadowy body will have the memories behind its painting's creation forced onto them.

[NAME] and its pre-Evolution, Galarian Yamask, are the only known Pokemon that can have Wandering Spirit as an Ability.",Ground,Ghost,Ground,Ghost,1.0,1,"[""Ground"", ""Ghost""]",515,76,591
Electrode,101,{{tt|Ball|Electrode}},"[NAME] is a round Pokemon resembling an upside-down Poke Ball with a smile mouth, black slit eyes, prominent black eyebrows that are usually depicted with an angry expression and eyes. Its top half is white, while its lower half is red. The Bandai Pokemon Carddass Cards depict [NAME] as hollow.

[NAME] tends to live in power plants where fresh electricity is being generated, which it consumes. As a result, it often causes blackouts. The more electric energy [NAME] consumes, the faster it moves. When full of stored electricity, it has been known to drift with the wind.

[NAME] explodes in response to even the smallest stimulation, simply to entertain itself, or because it has taken in too much electricity. However, unlike Voltorb, [NAME] can control its explosive ability at will. This unpredictable and explosive nature has earned it the nickname of ""Bomb Ball"". Because of its appearance, many Trainers try to pick [NAME] up, mistaking it for an item. As seen in the anime, if [NAME] explode to defend themselves, this also results in them using up their energy and becoming extremely worn out.",Electric,,Electric,,1.0,0,"[""Electric""]",504,9,513

Its feet are white and fairly small and its black tail is in a jagged shape.

[NAME] lives in treetops, sometimes in holes gouged by Pikipek, and uses its flaps to glide from tree to tree. It generates electricity in the electric sacs on its cheeks, stores it in its membrane, and discharges it while gliding. [NAME] does this in order to be able to scare off bird Pokemon, giving it the capability to gather lots of food. It then grills its food, being berries or bug Pokemon, with electric shocks before eating. Due to its tendency to stuff its cheeks with food, [NAME] sometimes has difficulties flying.

Each of its feet has two blunt claws, and it has a small tail.

[NAME] spends its time bathing in sand and avoids water at all costs. It covers itself in sand as a protective measure against germs and expels sand instead of sweat. When it walks through the sand, it shuts its nostrils but keeps its mouth open, swallowing any sand and prey along the way. It removes excess sand in its body from its nostrils, which it also does when angered or excited. [NAME] is more active during the day, and burrows into sand during the night to avoid the cold. It prefers to travel in groups of ten. Despite its large and heavy appearance, it may remain undetected, due to how well it hides in the sand.",Ground,,Ground,,1.0,0,"[""Ground""]",525,73,598

However, [NAME] is born with only a white tail that splits as [NAME] grows. The tails grow hot as [NAME] approaches Evolution.

[NAME] can manipulate fire to such precision as to create floating wisps of flame. These wisps are sometimes mistaken for ghosts by humans, but [NAME] uses them to assist in catching prey. Inside its body is a flame that never goes out. When the temperature outside increases, it will expel flames from its mouth to prevent its body from overheating. [NAME] performs this even when sleeping, as mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex. [NAME] is known to feign injury to escape from opponents too powerful for it to defeat.

It has a long neck, a short, stubby tail, and a single white claw on each hind foot. Above each of its large, deep blue eyes is an iridescent, sail-like structure. Typically, the sails are yellow at the bottom and fade into pink toward the tips. On each side of its body is a dark blue crystal. Pokemon-Amie has demonstrated that its sails can change color with its mood and the crystals on its sides permanently remain at freezing temperatures.

This ancient Pokemon was restored from a Sail Fossil that had been frozen in ice for over 100,000,000 years. However, although [NAME] was restored successfully, it is not expected to live long in the heat of the current environment. It calmly lived in cold lands where there were no violent predators like Tyrantrum around. As seen in the XY episode ''Coming Back into the Cold!'', when [NAME] whinnies, auroras appear in the night sky.

From Generation VIII onward, [NAME] and its evolved form, Aurorus, are the only known Pokemon that can have Refrigerate as an Ability.",Rock,Ice,Rock,Ice,1.0,1,"[""Rock"", ""Ice""]",523,76,599
Eldegoss,830,Cotton Bloom,"[NAME] is a plant-like Pokemon. It has a light green head, with amber-brownish eyes and light green pupils, as well as green triangular stripes above its eyes. [NAME]'s lower body consists of a yellow upper part that resembles a cloak, and a darker green lower part that resembles a dress. Above its head is a green crest that fills a notch in its head. This crest is filled with a cotton fluff that is larger than [NAME]'s body. There are tiny brown seeds that can be found scattered on the top of the cotton.

[NAME]'s cotton fluff acts like a cushion to protect its head from attacks. The cotton can also be spun into a glossy, gorgeous yarn that is a specialty in Galar. When [NAME]'s cotton is weaved together with Cottonee's cotton, it makes a cloth that is popular with many luxury brands. It is said that the seeds inside [NAME]'s cotton fluff is highly nutritious and beneficial for people and Pokemon. [NAME] spreads the seeds by wind, enriching the soil with nutrients wherever these seeds land.

Sinistea,854,Black Tea,"[NAME] is a Pokemon said to be created when a lonely spirit possesses a cold, leftover cup of tea. It is one of the shortest Pokemon in existence. The teacup that [NAME] lives in is a famous piece of antique tableware; seafoam green in color with gold rims and a lacy pattern that resembles a face (and functioning as one, being able to change to express emotions). However, there are many forgeries in circulation.

The swirl pattern on [NAME]'s purple body serves as a weakness. Should a [NAME] get stirred, the swirl will disappear and cause it to get dizzy. [NAME] can absorb the life force of anyone who drinks it. While it can wait patiently, most of [NAME]'s opportunities end up being short, as it tastes so bad that it is spat out immediately. [NAME] inhabits hotels and homes. The Antique Form of [NAME] is highly sought after by certain enthusiasts. These collectors dedicate considerable time and effort to prepare the perfect tea and teacup, hoping that a [NAME] will come and possess their selections. Poltchageist bears a resemblance to [NAME], although the two species are biologically unrelated. ",Ghost,,Ghost,,1.0,0,"[""Ghost""]",513,9,522
Copperajah,879,Copperderm,"[NAME] is a large, cuboid, elephantine Pokemon with a dark green body and a light teal underbelly. Pokedex entries for its pre-Evolution Cufant suggest that this coloration probably results from the tarnishing of copper in its skin over time. Untarnished copper accents cover most of [NAME]'s face, and pattern its ears, feet, trunk, and back. It has short, blunt tusks and a long, broad, muscular trunk that ends in three claw-like protrusions. It has three raised, white ridges on the dorsal end of its trunk, and several rocky protrusions on the dome of its skull.

Despite being found in the Galar and Paldea regions, [NAME] and its pre-evolved form Cufant are not native to either of them, having been imported from another region to work with humans. It also works with other Pokemon, such as Gigalith, in construction sites and mines. [NAME]'s tarnished skin is resistant to water. It has enough physical strength to pull an airplane, and its trunk is strong enough to reduce boulders to a fine powder. It lives in social herds and has a boastful disposition; the more vibrant its skin is, the prouder it will be.",Steel,,Steel,,1.0,0,"[""Steel""]",526,137,663

It has a conical point on top of its hair that is pink at the bottom and white at the top, with the tip being crooked and tapering off at the end. This gives the hair the appearance of a witch's hat. On the sides of its hair are two large, blue bulbous growths that appears to be held by pink rings. These growths resembles ponytails and [NAME] uses them to stand on. [NAME] has two, thin arms lacking any digits, and a white ovular spot on its chest. Its waist extends out into two lumps, with very small, light blue joint-less and digit-less legs. Its eyes have black sclerae and white pupils, with two pink dots for highlights that make its pupils vaguely resemble cartoon hearts. 

[NAME] makes use of its ponytails as hands, pummeling its foes with them. One blow from these ponytails would knock out a professional boxer. [NAME] perceives strong emotions, including positive ones, as if they're really loud noises. Thus, [NAME] will violently silence anything nearby expressing or feeling strong emotions.",Psychic,,Psychic,,1.0,0,"[""Psychic""]",520,458,978

Its arms are white and rounded, while its feet are dark blue with three toes each. It also possesses a rudder-like dark blue tail. It carries a pale yellow seashell called a ""scalchop"" on its belly.

This shell is made of the same material as its claws and is used for both battles and cracking hard berries. [NAME] wields the shell like a knife. It uses the scalchop to block the moves of its enemies before slashing back at them in swift retaliation. [NAME] learned to how maintain its scalchop with riverbed stones by copying the humans it observes using whetstones.

Two-pronged fins extend slightly past its cheeks. On its back is a white fin supported by thin, blue spines similar to the ones on its head.

The yawn of a sleeping [NAME] is powerful enough to create undercurrents capable of destroying small ships. Should it decide to emerge from the depths of the ocean, [NAME]'s strength can create large whirlpools and waterspouts on the surface. Because of its immense power, [NAME] often hibernates deep in uninhabited areas of the sea to build up its energy, usually at the bottom of the seas.

[NAME] smashes its steely body against others when battling over territory, and shows off its strength with the size of sparks it creates by ramming into rocks. Close inspection of [NAME] has revealed scratches and dents left on the armor from its conflicts. It drinks nutritious mineral spring water and feeds on iron contained in rocks. However it has gotten into conflict with humans over these territories in the past. It builds its nest on mountains where iron ore is buried, which results in it clashing with humans that are iron mining or other [NAME]. As mentioned in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] sometimes falls asleep while eating iron ore. The reason is due to [NAME] having strong desire to win in future territorial disputes.",Steel,Rock,Steel,Rock,1.0,1,"[""Steel"", ""Rock""]",506,204,710
Yanma,193,Clear Wing,"[NAME] is a large, red insectoid Pokemon that resembles a dragonfly. Compared to its long, thin abdomen, its thorax is short and wide.

A bright green mask marking covers most of its face, and it has two spikes on top of its head. Its blue eyes can see all around its body at 360 degrees without even moving its head. This allows Yamma to have a high evasiveness. The end of [NAME]'s tail has two flat extensions from the sides and two gray spikes in the center.

[NAME] is a skillful flier. It can make sudden stops, turn in midair and hover in place by flapping its wings at a high speed.

[NAME]'s aroma brings serenity, but the thorns on its head contain a vicious poison. The more healthy it is, the more pleasant its flowers' aroma. It shoots sharp thorns at anything that tries to steal its flowers and uses different poisons in each hand when it attacks. It lives in grassy areas where it drinks nutrient-rich spring water. [NAME]'s thorns are used as part of an old tradition, challenging an opponent to a duel by sending these thorns.

In Generation III, Grass Whistle was its signature move, but other Pokemon could still inherit it via breeding.",Grass,Poison,Grass,Poison,1.0,1,"[""Grass"",""Poison""]",516,12,528

There are three small toes and a yellow paw pad on each foot. Fluffy yellow fur forms a small tuft on its head, as well as its bushy tail and a mane around its chest and neck.

Rather than walking, this small Pokemon bounces like a ball to move around, as its body is extremely soft and elastic — although it may not be able to stop if it does this. As [NAME] moves, it secretes sweat with a sweet fragrance, which calms the emotions of its foes.

Although it has singing abilities, [NAME] is not able to sing for long periods due to its underdeveloped vocal cords. It often gets a sore throat from singing too frequently.

Its ears are large and pointed with black interiors, and its eyes and small nose are black. It has slender legs and small paws, each with three toes and a pink paw-pad.

[NAME] creates electricity using an organ in its lungs, which causes crackling noises as it exhales. It can also generate low-level electricity in its cells, which is amplified by the negative ions it gathers and generates in its fur, allowing it to discharge 10,000-volt lightning bolts.

Shelgon,372,Endurance,"[NAME] is a quadrupedal Pokemon that resembles a pupal stage. Most of its body is covered in a shell of six white plates, made from the same substance as bone. The three top plates each feature a ridge running along their lengths. The shell leaves two hexagonal openings that show small parts of its gray body: one at the back of its body, and the other at its front, where its yellow eyes can be seen. Protruding from between the bottom plates are four stubby gray legs with short red stripes on the inner surfaces.

This Pokemon's shell is hard enough to repel most forms of attack, but its sheer weight makes [NAME]'s movements extremely sluggish. Once it's ready to evolve, the shell immediately peels off. Barely able to move, [NAME] usually hides away in a cavern, awaiting Evolution. Underneath the shell, this Pokemon's cells are in the midst of rapid change, preparing a new body for it. During this time, [NAME] is never seen eating or drinking, ignoring its hunger entirely.

The direction of the belly spiral differs by area; the equator is thought to have an effect on it.

[NAME] has newly developed legs that are poor at walking and no arms. It has a long, thin tail surrounded by a light-blue, semitransparent fin. Its tail makes it a powerful swimmer. It loves to waddle on land despite the dangers. However, it will quickly return back into the water should it see danger. It cannot walk on land well unless trained everyday.

Because of its ineptitude on land, [NAME] is more likely to be found swimming in small freshwater ponds and lakes.

[NAME] has yellow underdeveloped electric sacs in its cheeks, as well as yellow pad-like organs on its forepaws that can discharge electricity. If it feels threatened, it will rub its cheeks to generate electricity, which it then delivers to its opponents by touching them with its forepaws.

Because of this behavior, its head has grown hard as steel, and its muscles are well-developed, especially in its neck, making it strong enough to destroy a boulder in one strike. It is a solitary Pokemon that prefers not to form groups. It is thought that [NAME]'s dream of flight stems from genetic information, and its behavior stimulates its cells in turn to prepare it for Evolution.",Dragon,,Rock,,0.0,0,"[""Rock""]",524,201,725

The stench of [NAME]'s fluid varies depending on its diet. [NAME] prefers to nest in large, prickly bushes in heavily wooded areas and digs holes in the ground to make its nest.

Pawmot,923,Hands-On,"[NAME] is a stout, bipedal, rodent-like Pokemon that has a body that is almost entirely orange, with tan colorations on its forepaws, snout, and long, fluffy tail, and green on the insides of its ears. Its face has beady brown eyes, a tiny nose, and yellow electric sacs on its cheeks. It has shaggy tufts of fur on its forehead and near its ears, as well as on its neck which forms a collar. [NAME] has five fingers on its considerably large forelimbs, which stretch down to its tiny feet. The colorations on its forelimbs create a zigzag pattern. It has yellow pads on its forepaws which turn teal-blue when it uses electric attacks.

Although [NAME]'s reaction speed is normally low, it is able to strike opponents with fast movements when battling. The fluffy fur on its body acts like a battery, allowing [NAME] to store as much electricity as in an electric car. As mentioned in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] has a peaceful personality. On occasion, [NAME] will heal injured Pokemon by discharging electricity from its forepaws. If [NAME] raises its paws while it sleeps, it is possibly dreaming of tending to other Pokemon.

Wo-Chien,1001,Ruinous,"[NAME] is a snail-like Pokemon comprising a dark-green mossy form covered in dead green and yellow leaves. Two pairs of long, curling vines form its eyestalks, which contain eyes with green eyelids, orange sclerae, and pale greenish pupils. A long row of wooden tablets curled around its backside forms its shell. Wooden tablets were once used as a writing medium in the East during ancient times, although the inscriptions written on the particular set forming [NAME]'s shell have become too faded to be read.

Like the other treasures of ruin, [NAME]'s true form is the row of wooden writing tablets forming its shell, having been given life by the grudges of the person punished for writing the evil deeds of a king on them long ago — while its body is a form it has constructed using its control over plant matter. [NAME] is able to drain the life force of vegetations in a wide area around it, causing entire forests and fields to instantly become barren. It is known as the Tablets of Ruin.

[NAME] and the other treasures of ruin are the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Ruination. [NAME] is also the only known Pokemon that can have Tablets of Ruin as an Ability.-",Dark,Grass,Grass,Ghost,0.0,0,"[""Grass"", ""Ghost""]",522,204,726
Ivysaur,2,Seed,"[NAME] is a quadrupedal amphibian Pokemon that has blue-green skin with darker patches. On top of its head are pointed ears with black insides, and it has narrow red eyes. [NAME] has a short, rounded snout with a wide mouth and two pointed teeth in its upper jaw. Each of its feet has three claws on them. The bulb on its back has bloomed into a giant pink bud. A short brown trunk surrounded by leafy green fronds supports the bud.

The weight of the plant prevents [NAME] from running fast and standing on its hind legs, forcing its legs to grow sturdy. When its flower is ready to bloom, it gives off a distinct, sweet-smelling aroma and starts swelling. [NAME] will also start spending more time in sunlight in preparation for its upcoming Evolution. Exposure to sunlight adds to the strength of both [NAME] and its plant. As shown in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] is known to sleep in sunny spots while undergoing its photosynthesis process. Researchers cannot decide if [NAME] is awake or asleep during this process. [NAME] has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: ''Sunbathing Sleep'', ''Sturdy Sleep'', ''Vines-Out Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''. [NAME] are typically found in plains.",Grass,Poison,Grass,Poison,1.0,1,"[""Grass"", ""Poison""]",533,13,546
Nosepass,299,Compass,"[NAME] is a blue, angular, bipedal Pokemon that closely resembles a Moai. Its bright red, triangular nose is highly magnetic and slightly resembles a 3D arrow. This nose functions as an electromagnet and always points north. [NAME]'s body is composed of a durable substance resembling volcanic rock. It has arms and legs without any visible joints and small, circular holes on the undersides. Its arms resemble compass needles. It has similar circular holes on the sides of its head. Its eyes, covered by dark, somewhat mask-like markings, have the appearance of being closed.

[NAME] cannot go near others, since it would repel them with its magnetic nose. Its magnetism becomes stronger in cold seasons. To protect itself when in danger, it raises its magnetism and draws iron objects to its body. This technique is also used to capture prey, though it can pull natural enemies close too. Because it always points north, [NAME] has historically been used as a compass for travelers. [NAME] only moves a little over 3/8 of an inch each year, but can quickly spin its body into the ground like a drill during emergency situations. It lives in caves. Metang are natural predators of [NAME].",Rock,,Rock,,1.0,0,"[""Rock""]",519,73,592

The upper half of its body is dark teal and the lower half is light greenish-yellow. Its tail is tall and thin with a dark teal outline, light greenish-yellow inside, and two dark teal dots in the center that resemble the Japanese character ハ ''Ha''. Its eyes are even with its body and are always seen slanted angrily. Below its eyes are its puffy pink lips. All around its body are sharp, conical spikes, which evolved from scales over time.

In order to attack, [NAME] drinks over 2.6 gallons (10 litres) of water to inflate its body. It then uses the water pressure to shoot poisonous quills at its foe, which can cause fainting. [NAME] is briefly left defenseless shortly after firing its quills; this is believed by some expert fishers to be the opportune moment to catch this Pokemon. Due to its round body, [NAME] is not a great swimmer, and when filled with water it is even harder for it to swim. When [NAME] faces a larger opponent, it will inflate its body to match its size as close as it can. If it is startled while inflated, it will spit out all its water, propelling itself away.",Water,Poison,Water,Poison,1.0,1,"[""Water"",""Poison""]",540,76,616

[NAME] has two small, pointed protrusions between its eyes and one on the back of its head. [NAME] also has protrusions on its jaws, two on the upper and three on the lower, with large, fang-like, white-colored features extending from its mouth. Its body is composed of many violet-to-lavender body segments which end with a tail with two stingers. [NAME] has four segmented legs with pointed toes.

The back half of its body has a large, spiky pattern of blue and it has a short tail. It has feet with three forward claws and one backward.

Its main attacking prowess involves charging head-first into its opponents. When it lived in dense forests and jungles 100 million years ago, it would use headbutts to snap obstructing trees, down its prey, and combat Pokemon like Aerodactyl and even other [NAME]. The resulting sound of two [NAME] headbutting echoes throughout the area like the sound of the pealing of a bell. It notably lacks any intelligence. [NAME] are considered to be a rare sight to encounter. The fossilized trunks of trees snapped in two are also often found near the fossilized rock layers of [NAME] fossils. It was brought back to life from a Skull Fossil. In modern times, [NAME] can be found at the Canyon Biome located at the Terarium.",Rock,,Rock,,1.0,0,"[""Rock""]",541,137,678

[NAME]'s black wings have a thick gray stripe down the side. It has pink feet with black talons.

[NAME] is not particularly intelligent. While it always listens to its Trainer's commands, it does not always understand them. [NAME] are so forgetful that they will wait for new orders from their Trainers even if it received one right before. In Detective Pikachu, their forgetfulness extends to them not even remembering their own names. In the JN episode ''There's a New Kid in Town!'', it extends to forgetting whatever scared them. Many Trainers love [NAME] due to its friendliness and sincere nature. [NAME] loves to follow people. Having no fear of people, flocks of [NAME] are often found in city parks and plazas, though they can also be seen in grasslands and rural areas. The cooing of these flocks can be very noisy.

Its tail is shaped similar to that of a palm tree's branch. Both of its long arms have two sharp, elongated leaves and three claws. In Generation III, Leaf Blade was its signature move.

[NAME] is a jungle-dwelling Pokemon. It has no equals in jungle combat. The seeds on its back contain nutrients, which are said to be able to revitalize trees. As mentioned in Sleep Style Dex, it is believed that the unique seed ability of [NAME] helps nearby tree saplings grow and thrive when it is asleep. [NAME] has four different sleep styles: ''Robust Sleep'', ''Dream-Stance Sleep'', ''Tree-Tending Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''. It is capable of leaping freely from branch to branch. While it has the ability to slice down thick trees, it is known to care lovingly for the plants in the forest.

There are black tear markings directly below its eyes. It has a large hump on its back. Each of its beige legs has a single, gray hoof and its tail ends in a stubby tuft of fur. 

A territorial Pokemon, it will headbutt anyone that attempts to invade its territory. However, in the BW episode ''Baffling the [NAME]!'', it is shown not to attack those with an afro hairstyle. Protected by its afro, which absorbs damage, its headbutts are strong enough to derail a train and send it flying. It can also destroy a car with just a Headbutt. The more hair a [NAME] has on its head, the higher positions it has in the herd. A herd of [NAME] consists of 20 individuals. For unclear reasons, a [NAME] loses its hair from its head should it ever betray its herd.

It has sharp, elongated claws and small pointed teeth. It has small, tuft-like ears, long cheek fur, and blue eyes.

[NAME] can run up to 100 kilometers per hour, but it can only run in a straight line, and has to stop before it can make a turn. Because of this behavior, it often fails to catch prey, and struggles on roads that are curving or winding. When it sees prey underwater in ponds, it leaps in and uses its razor-sharp claws to catch and take it down. [NAME]'s fur is strong and supple, and the shed hairs are used to make high-quality shaving brushes. As shown in the AG episode ''Showdown at [NAME]'', [NAME] has an attraction to anything round and will grab any orb-shaped object it sees if given the chance. It often carries a snatched object in its expandable cheek pouches and deposits it in any of a number of secret stashes it keeps on its territory.

Oddish,43,Weed,"[NAME] is a Pokemon that resembles a blue plant bulb or a root vegetable. It has a round body, beady red eyes, a small mouth, and ovoid feet. Five large, green leaves sprout from its head. As demonstrated in the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''Foul Weather Friends'', these leaves are prehensile and can be used to scale vertical surfaces and catch light objects. When defeated in the Pokemon Stadium series, [NAME]'s leaves fall off its head. Known by the scientific name ''Oddium Wanderus'', [NAME] lives in grasslands.

A nocturnal Pokemon, [NAME] buries its sensitive body in the ground during the day to avoid the sun and fool predators. If its leaves are pulled in this state, it will respond by shrieking horribly. It starts to move when its leaves begin absorbing moonlight, which it uses to grow. [NAME] will wander up to 1,000 feet (300 meters) during the night to scatter its seeds and find a nutrient-rich patch of soil in which to plant itself. The more fertile the earth, the glossier its leaves will be. It is thought that its feet become like tree roots while planted.

Cofagrigus,563,Coffin,"[NAME] is a blue and yellow sarcophagus-like Pokemon with red, menacing eyes and four ebony hands that appear to be shadows. A simply designed face, which is the mask Yamask carries, is prominent on the ""forehead"" of the Pokemon. Its real face is covered up by parts that slide open when it is active. White, sharp fangs create a taunting smile, and flamboyant patterns veil the coffin. The coffin is said to be made of solid gold. [NAME] is seemingly a distant relative of Runerigus.

Ancient legends once told [NAME] could seal nearby humans in their bodies and turn them into mummies; grave robbers who mistake them for normal coffins are known to be swallowed into their bodies. [NAME] is said to have once been human but having forgotten its memories from when it was alive. Their diet typically consists of gold nuggets. It lives in tombs and ruins waiting for victims. [NAME] has been used as a symbol for the wealth of kings from a bygone era.

It has beady dark blue eyes and a large, round, pink nose. Although [NAME] has a stated Pokedex height, it is unknown how long it really is underneath the sand, or what the rest of its body looks like.

[NAME] lives in beaches and seas, where it burrows into beach sand. It pokes part of its body out of the ground to feed. [NAME] has an exceptional sense of smell, which has a range of over 60 feet (20 meters). [NAME] is a timid and cautious Pokemon; it hides in the sand when it picks up the scents of other Pokemon, such as Veluza, nearby.

Some researchers initially mistook [NAME] for a Paldean form of Diglett due to their physical resemblance, but they are separate species and differ in habitat and diet. It is theorized that the two species ended up having similar body plans as an adaptation to suit their environments and burrowing behavior.",Water,,,,0.0,0,,493,512,1005
Pancham,674,Playful,"[NAME] is a bipedal, mammalian Pokemon that resembles a young panda. Its head and short, puffy tail are white. It has a triangular black nose, rounded black ears, black circles around its eyes, and tufts of fur on top of its head and on each cheek. Its upper body and hind feet are black, while the lower body is a dark gray. Where the two colors meet the dark gray forms a three-pointed pattern on its chest. There are three digits on each paw and small, dark brown circular pads on the soles of its black hind paws. [NAME] carries a small, green leaf in its mouth. There is no actual purpose behind this leaf, aside from an attempt to look cool.

[NAME] looks up to Pangoro as a leader and tries to emulate its behavior in an effort to learn how to battle and hunt for its prey. If [NAME] makes a big mistake, Pangoro will take away its leaf. It tries to make itself look serious to its foes, but its glare is not intimidating enough, and if it is distracted, it ends up grinning. Despite its attempts to look frightening, it cannot help grinning if patted on the head.

On the left side below its lip is what appears to be a singular, square-shaped ice crystal. It has a light blue underbelly and a short tail. Its short, stubby limbs have three digits each, and it has a long, thin, yellow quill on the backs of each of its hands. As revealed in ''Roy and Fuecoco's First Snow!'' in HZ, [NAME] compare the sizes of their yellow quills to settle fights in the wild, with the one with the longest and more colorful quills winning.

[NAME] has a triangular dorsal fin located atop a large, whitish circular pattern on its back. This fin absorbs heat, which [NAME] converts into ice energy. [NAME] stores the ice energy inside its body and uses it to cool its dwelling. It stores more ice energy the greater its surrounding temperatures are.

Its split tail fin has been mistaken for a mermaid's in the past and is believed to be the origin of mermaid folklore. It can detect moisture with its fins, which vibrate when sensing incoming rain.

[NAME] is mostly found in urban settings under the ownership of a Trainer. It is rarely seen in the wild, but it prefers clean freshwater lakes and shores. It has developed gills to become better suited to an aquatic lifestyle, and its cell composition's similarity to water allows it to melt into the water.

It has two pairs of pointed teeth, one in the upper jaw and one in the lower. Each of its short legs has three claws, capable of slicing through nearly any material. [NAME] is considered an unusual Pokemon due to the circumstances of its Evolution; its fervent desire to fly triggered a cellular mutation that allowed it to suddenly grow large, red wings.

Its long-held dream fulfilled at last, [NAME] constantly flies around and releases intense blasts of fire as an expression of its joy. It only stops flying when it gets exhausted and needs to sleep. If enraged, it loses all sense of self and flies into an uncontrollable rampage, destroying everything around it until it tires itself out.

Its feet are dark green and stubby.

This Pokemon was created when a mixture of domestic and industrial waste underwent a chemical reaction of some sort. [NAME] emits noxious, burp-like gases which, when inhaled, will render the victim bedridden for a week. This gas can also prove fatal when inhaled by young Pokemon and children. As evidenced in the BW episode ''Here Comes the [NAME] Squad!'', [NAME]'s ear-like tufts stand straight up when startled, are lifted if happy, and lowered if it is feeling down. Furthermore, in the same episode, it is also explained that once [NAME] befriends a person, it will cease expelling foul odors. It prefers unsanitary places, such as garbage dumps, where it finds trash and other rotten stuff such as moldy apples for food. Alolan Grimer is a common enemy of [NAME], and Alolan Muk preys on it.

[NAME] preys on Bunnelby, and has violent territorial clashes with Skarmory. In Paldea, [NAME] is constantly attacked by Tinkatuff and its Evolution Tinkaton, who pelts it with rocks as it flies; thus, Flying Taxis in Paldea use Squawkabilly instead of [NAME] to avoid potential dangers.

It has a tan ruff at the base of its neck, and shaggy darker brown wings with gray tips. [NAME] also has shaggy brown tail feathers. Its pink feet have black talons. It has decorated itself with bones — a jaw with sharp teeth — to form a skirt. When [NAME] sits on its Vullaby chick within its nest, [NAME]'s bony skirt combines with the bones around Vullaby's lower body to form an upside-down skull with sharp teeth. Different types of bones fall in and out of use as if there were fashion trends among [NAME].

[NAME] lives in nests made from the bones it finds, though they have also been seen using more traditional nests, such as in the Terarium. Weakened prey such as Cubone is dragged back to this nest after [NAME] swoops down on it from the sky.

It has a large hump on its back with several overlapping stripes that resemble an apple pie's crust on top, along with a pair of red and green leaves. It has four short, bulky legs with paws, and a stout tail.

[NAME]'s body is caked in sweet nectar, whose smell attracts Bug Pokemon which [NAME] preys on. However, [NAME]'s primary diet is sweet apples.

It has teal webbed feet and a large teal coif-like crest that covers its head, with a feathery tuft in the front and a white curvy line shaped like a wave. [NAME]'s coif has a smooth feel thanks to the rich, moist cream that holds it. The cream it secretes can repel grime. The coif can become unkempt should it get dry.

[NAME] is an earnest and tidy Pokemon, and tends to overthink things. [NAME]'s feathers secrete a glossy gel which protects its body against water and grime. It hates getting itself dirty, especially on its head. [NAME]'s strong legs allow it to swim without issues, even in strong currents.

[NAME] was first discovered around 400 years ago in coal mines. It races around on grassy plains and the rough, rocky terrain in coal mines and caves, burning through the coal that sustains it. [NAME]'s diet also includes grass that gets tangled in its leg. Until about 100 years ago, every household in Galar had a [NAME], using the coal that it drops for cooking and heating up homes.

Brambleghast,947,Tumbleweed,"[NAME] is a tumbleweed-like Pokemon that is similar to its pre-Evolution Bramblin, only larger and with more thorns. Most of the branches that compose its loose, spherical body are brownish yellow with light purple tips on top, while the base of its body and its center front branch are entirely dark brown.

The center front branch has two smaller branches near its base, which together with [NAME]'s eyes form a face. The two smaller branches act as [NAME]'s ""lips"", which can move to form expressions such as grinning or frowning. [NAME] has small, diamond-shaped, leaf-like eyes; the right eye is black with a thin red pupil, and vice versa for the left eye. Each eye is surrounded by what appears to be a much smaller tumbleweed made of three stalks. The eyes don't blink and instead flip and rotate to express [NAME]'s emotions.

Its body is covered with shaggy yellow fur and has several zigzagging brown stripes. The female has thinner stripes than the male. [NAME] has large green hands with two black lines on its palms, and thick green legs with a black circle on the underside of its feet.

[NAME] becomes more powerful when it hears festive music and will appear near laughing children on hikes. The reason is due to structures in [NAME]'s body that can produce energy when hit by sound waves with a cheerful rhythm. As it becomes more energetic and active, it will break into a dance. This allows [NAME] to face enemies without fear. Being the result of Evolution via Evolution stone, [NAME] is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found near the water's edge.

This electricity can be used to stimulate its muscles, which boosts the strength in its legs. This allows it to sprint a hundred yards in five seconds, even being capable of running on water without breaking surface tension, as shown in New Pokemon Snap and in the TCG. In Galar, there was an old desert culture that highly treasured the [NAME] due to treasure having arrived with them.

These hooves are said to be ten times harder than diamonds and act as shock absorbers.

[NAME] are relatively lightweight for their size, as they have extraordinary jumping abilities and are capable of leaping tall buildings in a single bound. However, a newborn [NAME] is a weak runner and is actually barely able to stand. It gradually strengthens its legs and becomes faster by chasing after its parents and jumping over grass that grows taller by the day. In the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''The Flame Pokemon-athon!'', it is shown that [NAME] can control its flames so that its rider is not burned by them, and [NAME] only does this for those that it has accepted.

Its gelatinous body forms a spiral shell-like structure on its back. Contained within the shell are its brain, heart, and other organs.

[NAME] excretes and coats its body with sticky mucus that can dissolve anything. Because it lacks teeth, it sprays this liquid onto prey and slurps them up once they are dissolved. Since its slime can melt through anything, predators stay far away from it. Its eyes have devolved, causing it to go blind. This makes it difficult for it to tell allies from prey and it will sometimes attempt to melt its companions. Its four horns act as a radar system and are used to detect sounds and smells.

The pack can also howl in unison to send information to allies from far away. [NAME] living in a pack follows a strict hierarchy, and will always follow the orders of their leader. This instinct also compels [NAME] to obey only the most experienced of Trainers. As depicted in the movie ''Zoroark: Master of Illusions'', [NAME] is prone to licking the faces of the people it's fond of. This species lives in grasslands and savannas.

However, [NAME]'s pupils are red instead of black, and its nose is longer. [NAME] has long, black hair with a bang that covers its right eye; the end of the hair is shaped like a pole arm. 

[NAME] lacks confidence in its physical strength, so it makes up for it with cunning and dirty tactics. It feigns surrender by going down on all fours to lure its opponents, before it stabs them with its hair. It tends to lure people into the woods where it lives. Like Impidimp, [NAME] feeds on negative emotions. Some people believe that [NAME] has the ability to make crops grow. [NAME] is very popular with people who have gloomy thoughts.

[NAME] typically lives underground. It uses its jaw as a weapon, a tool for burrowing, and for extracting sap from trees. Additionally, it can create sticky threads, which it shoots from its mouth and uses to swing around as though on suspension wires. It also uses these threads to stop opponents from moving, so it can then grab them in its mandibles, which are strong enough to snap thick tree branches. Even its natural enemies, such as Rookidee and Hoothoot, would rather run away than risk getting caught in its mandibles. It loves electricity and can be found near power plants. They can also be found near Electric Pokemon, as a means of avoiding attacks from bird-like Pokemon. As mentioned in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] uses its mandibles to makes nests underground.

[NAME] lives in abundance in dark caves, although it has also been known to dwell in forests and under the eaves of old buildings. Due to its habitat, [NAME] has evolved to have neither eyes nor nostrils. It instead navigates through dark environments and tight caves with echolocation, emitting ultrasonic cries to detect targets and obstacles. The frequency of these cries can vary slightly between [NAME] colonies. As demonstrated in the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''Clefairy and the Moon Stone'', it will leave its abode at night with a mass of other [NAME] to seek prey. [NAME] is nocturnal and sleeps hanging upside down during the daytime, avoiding sunlight at all costs. Daylight causes [NAME] to become unhealthy; prolonged exposure can even burn its skin.

Both pairs have green-blue membranes, but the lower pair's membranes are only visible from the back. The upper wings have two claw-like fingers near the middle. On the bottom of its body are what appear to be a pair of stubby feet or tufts of fur.

[NAME] is capable of flying long distances by alternating between its two sets of wings. The extra set of wings has also improved its flight speed without sacrificing its ability to fly silently. It can also travel through cramped caves without ever slowing. The combination of silent flight and sharp fangs allows it to bite down on prey without being noticed and drain their blood. If unable to consume blood, it becomes lethargic and unable to fly. Due to its lack of legs, it is clumsy on the ground and only able to crawl around with its wings. [NAME] is rarely found in the wild, though it is typically found in caves or on tree branches, where it hangs upside-down by its rear wings.

[NAME]'s two sheathes are attached to a plaque. The sheathes are varying shades of brown with lines forming a triquetra pattern across the front. Near the top of each sheath are a rhombus-shaped opening and three rings. When the swords are sheathed, the lines visible through the former give it the appearance of a toothy mouth, and the lines visible through two of the rings create the impression of closed eyes. The third ring extends onto the hilt and encircles the actual eye. 

[NAME] excels in both defensive and offensive strategies and can effortlessly slice through opponents.

Its feet have three small toes, and it has two black fins for tails. 

This Pokemon has a thin, sticky film enveloping its body that enables it to live on land. This development came from living on muddy ground where there is poor footing. Despite this, [NAME] is at its best when in this environment. Its body weakens if its skin dries out, so it plays in the mud on beaches when the tide is low to replenish fluids. As mentioned in Sleep Style Dex, [NAME] will burrow into the mud to sleep, seemingly feeling safe as it slumbers.

[NAME] can use their tails to communicate with other [NAME]. [NAME] works in large colonies in heavily wooded areas and makes rings by linking tails with another [NAME], apparently in friendship. [NAME] has been seen giving rings even to humans sometimes. It also shows affection by using both of its tails to wrap and squeeze people. It lives along with its young, Aipom. It lives high in the treetops of tropical, temperate, and even boreal forests, using its tails for balance as it swings from branch to branch. In the Alola region, while searching for comfortable trees, [NAME] tends to get into territorial disputes with Passimian, in which they win half the time.",Normal,,Normal,,1.0,0,"[""Normal""]",561,9,570
Sudowoodo,185,Imitation,"[NAME] is a Pokemon that has a brown, log-shaped body with yellow spots. It has short legs with toeless feet, and thin forelegs with three green spheres at the ends of its fingers. It has a forked ""branch"" on top of its head, which is shorter on the female than on the male. Despite its appearance, [NAME]'s composition is closer to a rock than a plant. This stony composition grants it a durable physique.

[NAME] disguises itself as a tree and stands along paths to avoid being attacked. [NAME]'s camouflage fails in the winter, as its forelegs remain green, unlike real trees. [NAME] is very weak to water and hates it, so whenever it starts to rain, it will break their disguise and flee to the nearest source of shelter. Because it holds its position for so long, its arms have become supple yet strong. It is popular with the elderly, with available magazines and fans devoted to its arm angle and length. [NAME] can be found living in forests, sometimes sharing a habitat with Trevenant. As mentioned in Sleep, [NAME] is known to keep its tree mimicry even when sleeping. However, it will occasionally retire this stance and instead sleep on the ground.

In Generation II, Mimic was its signature move, but other Pokemon could still inherit it via breeding.

It has long, flowing lilac-tipped ""hair"". [NAME]'s large, red eyes have yellow sclerae.

[NAME] lives in caves. As a nocturnal Pokemon, it spends its days sleeping in darkness and its nights startling people with mischievous tricks. Since it loves watching frightened people, it is known to yank and bite at people's hair or sneak up on them and cry and shriek in a way a child would. In the animated series, [NAME] is shown to be able to use its ""hair"" to grasp objects and other Pokemon, as if it were hands. Flutter Mane shares a resemblance to [NAME]. It was theorized to be a giant [NAME] reborn as a pterosaur ghost.

If attacked, [NAME] stands up on its hind legs, bares its fangs and shrieks in an intimidating manner at its enemy. It is willing to take on larger foes if provoked enough. Its teeth are strong enough to gnaw through steel and their constant growth means it often needs to gnaw on something, like rocks and logs. It may even chew on the walls of houses, and is capable of chewing through cinderblocks and toppling concrete buildings. As shown in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] is known to sleep with a log in its teeth, gnawing at it in the process. This Pokemon typically lives in plains and savannas.

[NAME] is proud of its sturdy body and will bash against others of its kind in a contest of sorts to prove whose body is harder. It will even go as far as to compare itself with other species such as Roggenrola and Carbink. The longer it lives, the more chipped and worn its body becomes. Long-lived [NAME] are completely smooth and round and they have a calm demeanor. However, [NAME]'s heart remains rugged and tough, no matter what.

Once [NAME] has bitten down onto something, it will not let go until it loses its teeth; any missing teeth will quickly grow back. [NAME] can rarely be found near water. As shown in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] and its evolutionary relatives are known to sleep with one eye open and rest only half of its brain at a time — a practice known as unihemispheric sleep.

Caterpie,10,Worm,"[NAME] is an insect Pokemon that resembles a green caterpillar with a yellow underside and teardrop-shaped tail. Yellow ring-shaped markings down the sides of its segmented body resemble its eyes and are meant to scare off predators. Its most notable characteristic is the bright red antenna (osmeterium) on its head, which releases a stench to repel predators. Despite these features and its camouflage in green foliage, [NAME] is often preyed upon by Flying Pokemon. Its four tiny feet are tipped with suction cups, permitting this Pokemon to scale most surfaces with minimal effort.

[NAME] is easy to capture and grows quickly, making it ideal for new Trainers.

Because of this, as well as its own star-shaped silhouette, [NAME] is commonly believed to have arrived on a shooting star. The ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''Clefairy Tales'' showed that its evolved forms (and therefore [NAME] itself) are actually extraterrestrial Pokemon. As mentioned in Sleep, [NAME] is known to sway its body similar to a rocking craddle while sleeping. The way it moves while sleeping resembles a twinking star in the night.

Each head is incredibly tough with a smooth surface, and has brown skin, black eyes, and a large, round, pink nose. [NAME]'s three heads think the same thoughts and act cooperatively, though on rare occasions may fight over which head gets to eat first. In order to make burrowing easier, each head will bob up and down to loosen the soil. [NAME] can tunnel under the earth at 60&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) to a depth of 60 miles (100 kilometers), triggering tremors and earthquakes. It is capable of burrowing endlessly. [NAME] lives in tunnels and caves under the earth. [NAME] is considered important for agriculture as its digging aerates the soil and makes it suitable for farming. As shown in the Pikachu short ''Pikachu's Rescue Adventure'', [NAME] sometimes lives in hollow trees in forests. It maintains the soil and plants trees to revitalize wooded areas. As mentioned in Pokemon Sleep, the three triplets of [NAME] is known to sleep together, never separating from each other. The trio's teamwork remains strong even when sleeping.

In Generation II, [NAME] and its pre-evolved form, Diglett, were the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Fissure.",Ground,,Ground,,1.0,0,"[""Ground""]",560,9,569
Fletchling,661,Tiny Robin,"[NAME] is a small, avian Pokemon similar in appearance to a robin. It has a reddish-orange head with a triangular yellow mark on the back of each eye.

It communicates by using chirps and moving its tailfeathers to signal others of its kind. In spite of its typically peaceful disposition, it is relentless in battle and very territorial, attacking perceived threats mercilessly. Its body is warm and doubles in temperature when startled or excited. This increase in temperature spikes hormone production in its body. It can burn someone if they touch it with their bare hands.

It has four yellow legs with two purple bands each; on its back are yellow structures similar to its legs with a single purple stripe each. Its feet are tipped with tiny hooks that allow it to climb ceilings and vertical walls.

[NAME] makes its nest in the depths of temperate and tropical forests and leaves after dark to hunt prey. [NAME] never rest in a specific place while hunting. While [NAME] wanders in search of prey, it spins a single thread from its rear that leads back to its nest. When prey is captured, it is wrapped in thread and then attacked by fangs. [NAME] then drinks the victim's bodily fluids at leisure. Sometimes, it will instead release prey with only a single thread attached. The thread is then followed to both the caught prey and its friends.

[NAME] and its pre-evolved form, Spinarak, are the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Toxic Thread. Before Generation V, Spider Web was its signature move.",Bug,Poison,Bug,Poison,1.0,1,"[""Bug"", ""Poison""]",554,13,567
Applin,840,Apple Core,"[NAME] is a small, worm-like Pokemon with a light green body and a dark green underside. Its head is round with two pink nostrils. Above its head are two large leaf-like eyestalks which house its two small black eyes. These eyestalks give the apple it lives in the appearance of having a stem with leaves. [NAME] also has two thin hairs on the tip of its tail, as well as two stubby forelimbs which are usually hidden inside its apple.

[NAME] is both the lightest and shortest Dragon Pokemon, and also one of the shortest Grass Pokemon. As soon as it is born, it burrows into an apple that looks like a Leppa Berry, which serves as a home, food source, and protection against preying bird Pokemon. The apple is prevented from rotting thanks to [NAME]'s body fluid, which also strengthens the fruit's rind. If [NAME] runs out of apples to eat or if it is separated from its apple, its body will lose moisture, and it will become dehydrated and weak. Since [NAME] hides inside an apple, it is sometimes mistaken by the frugivorous Noibat for food. In Galar, it is a custom to give an [NAME] as a romantic gesture. The flavor of the apple [NAME] lives in determines its Evolution, the apples can be exceptionally tart, sweet, or syrupy.

[NAME], Flapple, and Appletun are the only known Pokemon that can have Ripen as an Ability.

It has round black eyes and a pink beak-like mouth.

[NAME] can cause its luminescent spots to blink and flash; this behavior serves a variety of uses. If [NAME] is threatened, the blinking lights will cause its opponents to become dazed and lose their will to battle, allowing it to escape. The blinking also serves to attract [NAME]'s prey, which is then ensnared and held in place by its tentacles. [NAME] also uses various complex rhythms and patterns of lights to communicate to others of its kind. Because of this, [NAME] instinctively reacts to anything in its habitat that emits light or echoing sounds. By floating upside-down, [NAME] improves its blood flow along with clearing its head. This also drastically boosts the power of [NAME]'s Psychic moves and is what triggers its Evolution into Malamar.

Prior to Generation VIII and in Generation IX, [NAME] and its evolved form, Malamar, are the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Topsy-Turvy.",Dark,Psychic,Dark,Psychic,1.0,1,"[""Dark"", ""Psychic""]",560,141,701

Covering [NAME]'s mouth is a leaf with a long, brown, yellow-tipped vine growing out of it.

[NAME] is said to live in huge colonies deep in jungles, although no one has ever returned from there. Being the result of exposure to an Evolution stone, [NAME] is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in temperate forests and jungles. The vine on its leaf is flicked to mimic an animal in order to attract prey. It also produces a sweet scent of nectar or honey to further aid in luring its victims. Acid that has dissolved numerous prey becomes sweeter and even more effective at attracting prey. In the Pokemon Adventures chapter ''A Hollow [NAME]'', [NAME] hoards food, usually small birds and rodents, and collects Leaf Stones to perform Evolution rituals at night to help Weepinbell become [NAME] as well. As mentioned in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] is known to sleep with its mouth open to draw in prey.

They contain ten sharp, metallic teeth—six on the top row and four on the bottom. While the jaws are actually transformed steel horns, [NAME] can articulate them at will, using them to bite enemies with enough force to break an iron beam. These jaws are incapable of tasting, leading [NAME] to use them to eat food it does not like.

[NAME] is typically found in caves. It uses its non-threatening facial appearance to make foes underestimate it, then attacks with its giant jaws, sometimes swallowing its prey whole. When engaged in battle, [NAME] usually has its back turned to the enemy to make better use of its jaws. As mentioned in Sleep Style Dex, [NAME] tends to sleep while hugging its jaws occasionally. It is unknown whether it's a trap or not, unless one takes a closer look. [NAME] has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: ''Flattened Sleep'', ''Jaw-Swinging Sleep'', ''Jaw-Hugging Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''.",Steel,Fairy,Steel,Fairy,1.0,1,"[""Steel"", ""Fairy""]",570,77,647
Victini,494,Victory,"[NAME] is a small, rabbit-like Pokemon with large, pointed ears which form the letter V. It has large, blue eyes and a round, cream-colored head, which is comparatively large compared to its small, cream body, while the tops of its ears, crest, and extremities are all orange.

The foremost pair are simple claws with two spikes, while the rear pair are large and thick with two white claws. A yellow triangle marks the base of its lobster-like tail.

[NAME] is a very violent Pokemon that lives in ponds. Because of its constant challenges to battle, no other Pokemon wants to inhabit its territory. Not even a swarm of Basculin will drive [NAME] away. Any that do venture too close are tossed out of its pond with its pincers. An experienced [NAME] will be covered in scars from countless battles. However, it must molt regularly and its shell is soft immediately after. Once its pincers fall off, [NAME] turns timid until they grow back. In order to protect itself, it burrows under stream beds until its new shell hardens. Unlike the meat found in the claws of Crabrawler and Clauncher, [NAME]'s have foul smell and taste.

It has a small, triangular pink nose, pink paw pads on the undersides of its feet, and small tan spots above its eyes. It has a small brown puff of a tail.

[NAME] almost always keeps one of its ears rolled up. Although Professor Laventon had hypothesized that this is done to protect its hearing, in actuality, [NAME] rolls its ears so it can quickly unroll them and launch them as an attack. The attack is strong enough to hurt grown-ups and crush boulders, and increases in power as [NAME] trains to use it. [NAME] can also use this technique to jump really high, by slamming its ears towards the ground. [NAME]'s arms and legs are weaker by comparison. If [NAME] senses danger, it perks up both ears; conversely, if [NAME] rolls both of its ears in, it is a sign that it is unhealthy. On cold nights, [NAME] sleeps with its head tucked into its fur. It lives in forests, though it can also be found on icy mountains.

There are two long, ivory tusks in its upper jaw. It has a round snout and yellow eyes, and large tufts of white fur about its face and neck. Its four short legs have long flippers instead of feet.

[NAME] lives in and around icy seas, where it is insulated against the cold by its thick layer of blubber. This layer of fat also protects it from enemy attacks by causing them to bounce off. While its long tusks are capable of crushing ice up to 10 tons in one blow, they may break during battle. [NAME]'s tusks grow continuously throughout its life, and any broken ones will grow back by the following year. The Hisui region is famous for the many broken tusks of [NAME] that can be found there. This Pokemon can be found in herds of 20 to 30 individuals, which are fiercely protected by the leader. The leader is willing to give up its life in order to protect the herd.

However, a sufficiently long soak in water will cause its body to soften to some degree. Inside of [NAME] lies an energy core, making its body somewhat warm to the touch. Its ear leads straight to its energy core, causing it to become angry if someone sticks their hand in there. As stated by Cilan in ''Where Did You Go, Audino?'', [NAME] has sensitive hearing and can hear sounds that are inaudible to humans. It tends to follow the sounds it picks up with its lone ear, panicking if these sounds cease. Dwebble is a natural enemy of [NAME], as the former tends to think that [NAME] is an inanimate rock to turn into a home.

The Bandai Pokemon Carddass Cards depicts [NAME] as having a hollow body.

[NAME] creates gases within its body by mixing toxins with garbage, and produces more gas in higher temperatures. These gases are malodorous and cause sniffles, coughs, and teary eyes to those around them. The gases are also lighter than air, allowing [NAME] to hover. When agitated, it creates a more toxic gas and expels it through the holes in its body. As shown in the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''Pokemon Emergency!'', [NAME]'s gas can be ignited by fire or electricity. It feeds on the fumes of raw, rotting trash found in gas dumps and polluted air. [NAME] at one point was plentiful in Galar due to factories. [NAME] is most often found in urban areas.

[NAME] is considered the weakest Dragon Pokemon. Its body is mostly water and is covered by a germ-laden mucous membrane. This slimy layer causes physical attacks to slide off harmlessly. However, it becomes unable to breathe and will die if its body dries out. Because of this, it stays in damp, shady areas. [NAME]'s horns have powerful sensors that allow it to locate any sign of the enemy, allowing it to survive any kind of danger. As seen in the XY episode ''A Slippery Encounter!'', its diet consists of leaves.

In Hisui, when [NAME] evolves into Sliggoo, it gains an additional Steel along with a metallic spiral shell due to its mucus having a reaction to the iron-rich waters of the region.

[NAME] and its Hisuian evolved forms are the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Shelter. Additionally, prior to Generation IX, [NAME] and its evolved forms were the only known Pokemon that could have Gooey as an Ability.",Dragon,,Dragon,,1.0,0,"[""Dragon""]",572,73,645
Cosmoem,790,Protostar,"[NAME] is a Pokemon in the shape of a translucent, dark-blue orb with a starscape pattern set in a golden shell-like structure. The main portion of the shell is a flat oval around the center of the orb. Eight more flat, half-oval projections surround the orb in an asterisk-shape. At the center of the main body is a much smaller black core. The upper half of the core has a thin blue line on the front, back, and each side, while the lower has pink lines. On the front are two orange semicircles, which appear to be closed eyes. The overall shape of this Pokemon also resembles an eye. When evolving, the Pokemon glows either an orange or a purple color, correlating to Solgaleo and Lunala, respectively, gaining traits of either a stylized sun or a stylized moon.

Encased in its sturdy, cocoon-like shell, [NAME] is unable to move. In Pokemon Refresh, it cannot even eat. It grows as it absorbs starlight and the dust in the air. Its body is warm to the touch. [NAME]'s shell is said to be harder than any known material. In ancient times, it was known as the ""cocoon of the stars"" by the people of Alola.

[NAME] is one of the shortest Pokemon in existence. Despite this, it is also the heaviest Pokemon in existence, being tied with Celesteela. [NAME]'s height in the Pokedex is actually measured by its width, rather than its height, as seen in its concept art.",Psychic,,Psychic,,1.0,0,"[""Psychic""]",591,10,601
Hariyama,297,Arm Thrust,"[NAME] is a large, bulky humanoid Pokemon that is modeled after a sumo wrestler. It has narrow eyes and rounded ears. On its head is a short, triangular crest. Dark blue hair grows across the tops of its eyes, around the head crest, and extends down its back to form a long ponytail. The upper half of its body is cream-colored, while the lower half is dark blue. Yellow extensions encircle its waist, resembling a skirt. There is a small, orange half-circle marking in the center of its torso just above the skirt. [NAME] has large hands with three fingers and small, two-toed feet. Both its hands and feet are orange.

[NAME]'s body consists mostly of muscle instead of fat. When its body tenses, its muscles become as hard as stone. It likes to match power with other big-bodied Pokemon and can stomp the ground to build its own power. Trucks can be sent flying, telephone poles broken in two, and trains can even be stopped by its powerful palm strikes. They are kindhearted and practice etiquette, praising its battle opponents. As it grows older, it focuses more on training Makuhita. It lives in mountainous areas. Iron Hands bear a resemblance to [NAME].

[NAME] and its pre-evolved form, Makuhita, are the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Smelling Salts by leveling up. Prior to Generation V, Arm Thrust was also one of its signature moves.",Fighting,,Fighting,,1.0,0,"[""Fighting""]",568,10,578
Ekans,23,Snake,"[NAME] is a purple, serpentine  Pokemon. Its eyes, underbelly, the thick stripe around its neck, and the rattle are yellow. [NAME] have three pairs of black lines encircling their body, and another line connects to each slit-pupil eye and curves toward its nose. Its large mouth has a round, pink tongue and no visible teeth. While painful, a newborn [NAME]'s bite is not venomous. This Pokemon grows longer with age.

[NAME] live in grassy savannas and plains, moving stealthily through the grass. It can also be found in forests and desolate wastelands, where it preys on Eggs from Pidgey and Spearow nests but will strike other prey from behind. By flicking its tongue out, it can detect danger and the scent of prey. Its jaw can detach to swallow large prey, but such a meal can make [NAME] too heavy to move or become stuck and cause them to faint. It wraps itself around tree branches at night to rest. If not in a tree, it will coil itself up—a position in which it can defend itself from all directions. In the second movie, it is revealed to possess some swimming abilities. As shown in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] are known to sleep with their bodies all coiled up. It is believed that [NAME] do this to terrify foes, no matter which direction the foe is.

It is red, with circular orange-yellow heat-generating organs on the underside of each section, while its dorsal side, along with its legs and mandible, are a darker shade of red. The head has an orange mark in the shape of an exclamation point (""!"") on the top, and two bright yellow eyes with triangular red pupils. It has orange-yellow flames coming out of its head and rear, simulating antennae and telson. [NAME] creates flammable gases by fermenting the food in its body, and then burns these gases through the heat-generating organs along its underside. This results in the overflowing flames on either end of its body, which can reach temperatures of almost 1,500&nbsp;°F (800&nbsp;°C). As shown in the manga, the flames on its head can turn off.

Due to its violent and belligerent nature, [NAME] will attack anything that comes near it. When in battle, [NAME] will rear up and use its long, hot body to attack, either by slamming its searing belly into opponents like a whip or constricting them with its body.

Heatran,485,Lava Dome,"[NAME] is a reddish-brown, quadrupedal Pokemon. It is dotted with orange and gray spots, and it has metal bangles locked on its legs. Its four claws on each of its feet are in a cross formation. [NAME] has a gray underside, and its face is covered by an iron mask, with red-orange eyes uncovered. Its eyes seem to remain open even when it is asleep. Whenever it is seen with its mouth open, an orange glow emanates from inside it. Boiling, magma-like blood circulates through its body. While its body is rugged steel, certain parts of it are partially melted, due to [NAME]'s own intense body heat.

[NAME] is believed to the embodiment of the planet's boiling core. According to legends, [NAME] is said to have been birthed from the boiling magma within volcanic mountains such as Mount Coronet and Reversal Mountain. A Magma Stone is capable of both controlling and sealing [NAME] within its lair. Without the power of the stone, it would rampage and cause the volcanic crater where it dwells to erupt. [NAME]'s claws allow it to dig deep into walls. Its feet allow it to stick to surfaces so it can hang and climb on walls and ceilings. The body of [NAME] is said to hold many unsolved mysteries. [NAME] has the ability to form a shield around itself in order to protect itself from harm.

Boltund,836,Dog,"[NAME] is a quadrupedal, canine Pokemon. Its two front paws are white with a yellow stripe on each leg above the white part, which leads to its desaturated green legs. Its two back paws are a darker yellow with a lighter yellow on top of it that also leads to desaturated green legs. It has a thin, yellow tail and hind legs with two spikes on the top of each of them. When it raises its tail, the tail takes the shape of a lightning bolt. The bottom half of its body is mainly desaturated green, while the upper part is mainly yellow. [NAME]'s head is yellow with white markings that extend over its muzzle, under its eyes, and in between its eyes, going up to its forehead. This white spot also goes down and ends in a triangle shape on the front of its chest. Its eyes are yellow, mint-green, white, and black with no distinct pupil. An outer ring of a light yellow is also around each eye. The inside of its ears is yellow with an outer ring of black. The desaturated green and yellow halves of its body connect on [NAME]'s shoulders, with the yellow part extending down in its front to cover [NAME]'s underbelly.

[NAME] can channel the electricity that it generates to its legs in order to keep them strong, boosting its strength and allowing it to run nonstop for three full days. It can easily run faster than 80 km/h at top speed. It serves as the enemy of Thievul.",Electric,,Electric,,1.0,0,"[""Electric""]",577,9,586
Vileplume,45,Flower,"[NAME] is an indigo, bipedal  ''Rafflesia''-like  Pokemon with rudimentary hands and feet. It has beady red eyes and a small mouth, and its head and torso are a single joined segment. On its head is a massive red flower with five bulky petals and an orange-brown center. [NAME]'s flower is said to have the largest petals in the world and is almost too heavy for the Pokemon itself to support. The rounded petals of the flower are red and covered with white spots. A female [NAME] has fewer, but larger, spots on its petals. When defeated in the side series games, [NAME]'s body appears to either deflate or withers while the flower remains.

[NAME] can shake, flap, or burst its petals into bloom with a bang in order to release clouds of pollen. This pollen is yellow and highly allergenic to humans, and toxic to other Pokemon; [NAME] uses it to paralyze its prey before devouring it. The larger the [NAME]'s petals are, the more potent the toxin on its pollen is. [NAME]'s behavior of flapping its petals also makes very loud noises. Being the result of an Evolution via Evolution stone, [NAME] is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in grassy plains. It is often mistaken for local flowers in the wild.

Prior to Generation II, [NAME] and its pre-evolved forms were the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Petal Dance.",Grass,Poison,Grass,Poison,1.0,1,"[""Grass"", ""Poison""]",579,13,592
Metang,375,Iron Claw,"[NAME] is a robotic Pokemon with teal, metallic skin. It has a disc-shaped body with a pair of flat, gray spikes on either side toward the rear. A jet cannot scratch [NAME] due to its strong body. There is a gray spike in the middle of its face, similar to a nose. A pair of red eyes reside in two holes in its metallic skin. While it appears to lack legs, it has a pair of thick arms with three claws on the ends. The arms are considerably thicker below the elbow and have a flat, blunt protrusion extending over the joint.

[NAME] is formed when two Beldum fuse together. A magnetic nervous system joins the brains of these two Pokemon. This linkage allows [NAME] to generate a strong, psychokinetic power that is doubled. However, this does not increase its intellect. This Pokemon's high intelligence and strong magnetic field are other sources of powerful psychic energy. In addition to generating psychic power, its magnetism allows [NAME] to hover in midair. It is able to rotate its arms backwards in order to travel at speeds over 60 mph (100 km/h) in search of prey. When [NAME] finds its prey, it uses its psychic power to stop it from escaping. Then it firmly grabs onto the prey with its claws, never letting go. [NAME]'s claws are able to rip through steel. This Pokemon lives on rough terrains and harsh mountains. It pursues Nosepass, loving its magnetic minerals.",Steel,Psychic,Steel,Psychic,1.0,1,"[""Steel"", ""Psychic""]",571,13,584
Aerodactyl,142,Fossil,"[NAME] is a reptilian, bipedal prehistoric Pokemon that resembles a pterosaur with several draconic features. It has small sharply pointed ears, narrow dark green eyes, a ridged snout, a gaping mouth, and a strong lower jaw full of serrated fangs. Its body is covered in light blue-gray skin and it has large, violet membranous wings. The clawed hands at the end of each wing allow it to grasp objects. There is a hump-like ridge with a spike on its back, and it has a strong tail with an arrow-shaped tip. Its talon-like feet have two toes in front and one in the back, and are capable of scooping up and tightly clutching its prey in flight.
 
[NAME]'s serrated saw-like fangs and ferocious attitude were very imposing in its time. Its fangs can rip out throats and tear through the skin of any Pokemon to pieces, even Steel Pokemon. By spreading its wings, [NAME] is believed to have flown by gliding through the skies, freely letting out its high-pitched cries. However, it is slow to walk on land. It liked to nest in the mountains, where it enjoyed both safety and seclusion. [NAME] lived in prehistoric times, and was theorized to become extinct thanks to a giant meteor impact. It was restored in modern times using genetic material extracted from amber; some casualties occurred during these attempts. Even still, this restoration is not considered perfect.",Rock,Flying,Rock,Flying,1.0,1,"[""Rock"", ""Flying""]",573,76,649
Kingler,99,Pincer,"[NAME] is a crustacean Pokemon resembling a crab. Its strong shell serves as a natural armor and covers the outside of its body, featuring a red upper half and a light tan lower half. Its upper half is topped with six tall, thin spikes that resemble a crown. Its light tan arms are also connected to its upper body. Its lower half doubles as its jaw with six fangs overlapping its upper body. Its two outer fangs are much larger than the inner four and are roughly half as tall as [NAME]'s entire body. Its hips visibly protrude from its lower body and connect to its four long, thin legs. Each leg has a single, claw-like foot. [NAME]'s main features are its orange pincers. Its left claw is roughly twice as large as the other and is as hard as steel.

[NAME] is often found on the edges of water, usually the ocean. Its powerful claws have 10,000 horsepower and are capable of prying open the shells of Shellder and Cloyster. While [NAME]'s large, left claw is its main tool for offensive maneuvers, it is so large and heavy that [NAME] can barely lift it. It causes balancing problems and [NAME] may quickly become fatigued from continuous use. However, it has been shown to communicate with other [NAME] by waving its pincers around.

Gigalith,526,Compressed,"[NAME] is a blue, quadrupedal Pokemon, with various spiny, reddish-orange, crystalline features jutting out from all over its body; two appear along its back, one on its chest, and one topping each of its four feet. Each foot also bears two claws of a similar appearance and is connected to the body by gray joints. The yellow, front-facing ears of its previous evolutionary relatives are now filled in with red and appear to have become full-fledged eyes. Several of the aforementioned reddish-orange crystals also appear on its face; three below its eyes, one in the middle resembling a crest, and two other crystals connected to the sides of its head. The stone comprising its body is extremely hard.

[NAME] compresses energy in the core inside its body, allowing it to fire attacks powerful enough to blow away mountains. When it fires these attacks at full power, the sheer force of the blast creates multiple cracks on its body. It can also store sunlight in its orange crystals, magnify it within its body, and shoot powerful energy balls that can destroy dump trucks from its mouth, though it loses this ability at night or during rain. It lives in caves and tunnels deep underground. [NAME] is a hardy Pokemon with impressive horsepower, and is a popular partner for construction workers and miners. In Galar, it works with Copperajah in construction sites and mines.",Rock,,Rock,,1.0,0,"[""Rock""]",545,393,938
Wigglytuff,40,Balloon,"[NAME] is a balloon-like Pokemon with leporine features, a bean-shaped body and stubby arms and legs. A fluffy, curled tuft of fur on its head is described as perfectly heavenly. It has long, rabbit-like ears with black insides and a slightly lighter color at the tips. Its large, blue eyes are covered in tears that quickly wash away debris. It is covered in pink fur with a white belly. This fine layer of fur is so soft that those who touch it, including other [NAME], will not want to stop. As a result, [NAME] is a highly sought-after Pokemon because of its bouncy body and fur. It sheds seasonally, and people gather the fur to spin into yarn. It is proud of its fine and delicate fur.

Its body is soft and rubbery, allowing it to inflate by inhaling. [NAME] can inflate itself up to 20 times larger, though it has no limits to how far it can inflate. While it is inflated, it can move by bouncing or floating. It competes with other [NAME] to see which can inflate itself the most. Should it be caught in a bad mood, [NAME] will inflate itself to an enormous size to scare away its opponent. Due to evolving via Evolution stone, [NAME] is rarely found in the wild. However, they can be found in vivid green plains and grassy fields. As mentioned in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] is known to stroke its belly while sleeping, possibly to feel its soft fur.",Normal,Fairy,Normal,Fairy,1.0,1,"[""Normal"", ""Fairy""]",577,333,910
Raboot,814,Rabbit,"[NAME] is a humanoid, rabbit-like Pokemon. It has thick, fluffy fur in multiple colors: the fur on its head, hands, and small tail are grayish-white, while the fur on its body is primarily black, with red colorations on its arms, shoulders, and front half of its feet. It also has a fur collar that covers its neck and mouth like a balaclava, while its belly has tufts that are similar in appearance and function to jacket pockets. [NAME] also has long ears, a few tufts of fur on top of its head, red irises, and a small yellow nose. 

[NAME]'s fur protects it from the cold, and allows it to use hotter fire moves, which it delivers through the yellow marks on its forehead and soles. [NAME] takes great pride in its kicking moves. [NAME] usually practices its footwork by kicking Berries from a tree's branches and then juggling them with its feet. While training its kicking attacks, [NAME] tries to avoid using its arms, tucking them under its fur. This effectively prevents [NAME] from losing body heat. [NAME] is also capable of delivering powerful headbutts once its flames within heat up its forehead.

[NAME] and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pokemon that can have Libero as an Ability.

Spheal,363,Clap,"[NAME] is a chubby, spherical, seal-like Pokemon with a short, flat tail. Its plushy fur is light blue with several white spots of various sizes on its back. This covering of fluffy fur, combined with the layer of blubber underneath, retains heat and protects [NAME] from the cold. It has black, circular eyes; small tusks protruding from its upper jaw; and small, rounded ears. Its stubby flippers and its underside are both beige.

When it is happy or cheerful, such as when eating in a group, this Pokemon will clap its fins. The mealtimes of [NAME] have been described as noisy as a result. Because its body is poorly shaped for swimming and can only walk slowly, it moves primarily by rolling across ice floes. This Pokemon lives in and around the sea. [NAME] also lives on any drift ice that comes near the shore in order to avoid predators. [NAME] are often juggled by its evolved form Sealeo, which does so to check the former's health. When a [NAME] finds prey while drifting at sea, it will inform the Walrein leader of its herd on where to find the prey. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, [NAME] has been seen clapping its fins merrily while asleep on its back. It has led to those being curious about what happy things [NAME] is dreaming about once it awakens.

Lechonk,915,Hog,"[NAME] is a stout Pokemon resembling a hog. Its body is almost entirely grayish black, except for the brown colorations on its face and ears, and the yellow growths under its eyes that resemble teardrops. Its ears are droopy with yellow insides, and they partially cover its eyes. It has a triangular pink snout with two huge oval nostrils as well as stubby feet ending in pink hooves. Its tail is short and curled.

[NAME] has an excellent sense of smell, which it uses to find fragrant wild grasses and rich Berries to eat. This diet causes it to emanate a herbal body odor that repels bug Pokemon. [NAME] is also known to feed on the sweet nectar on Appletun's back. [NAME] has a timid and faint-hearted temperament, and will panic and charge forward if attacked or startled by an opponent. Despite its apparent bulk, [NAME]'s body mainly consists not of fat but of muscle, built up by its habit of walking around to find food. Some Trainers use [NAME] to look for cooking ingredients, such as detached Crabominable pincers scattered on mountains. As seen in the HZ episode ''Welcome to Paldea!'', [NAME] will become hostile towards trainers carrying groceries or meals and attack them for their food.",Normal,,,,0.0,0,,536,512,1048
Mienshao,620,Martial Arts,"[NAME] is a white, long-bodied mustelid Pokemon with a small head and small, triangular ears. Its forehead has a purple spot adorning it as well as a yellow one on its snout. It has purple eyebrows that resemble eyelashes above its narrow maroon eyes, and it possesses a pair of long, yellow-tipped whiskers which have split ends. Its arms are almost completely covered by a large amount of fur that is tipped in purple and split at the end, resembling long sleeves. Its torso has one purple ring of fur around its midsection. It also has purple fur on the bottom section of the torso, which resembles pants, and its bottom paws are clawed. It has a long, skinny tail that, like its paw fur, is tipped purple and split at its end. [NAME] is respectful and is usually seen training with its Trainer.

When facing a truly challenging opponent, [NAME] will bite off the fur from its arms to make itself lighter. Its arm fur is used as a weapon in battle and acts like a battle whip. Before it attacks, it lets out a bizarre wail. It then creates combination attacks that are difficult to see and overwhelmingly unstoppable, and slowly stores up power for a finishing blow. When using its blinding speed, [NAME] can crush massive boulders into tiny pieces. ''A New Perspective'' demonstrates that [NAME] can extend the fur on its arms at will and stretch it far enough to tie its opponents.",Fighting,,Fighting,,1.0,0,"[""Fighting""]",568,394,962

There is a yellow spot on its palms and the soles of its feet. It has beady eyes and a long, prehensile tongue, with nerves that extend its entire length. The tongue is likely connected to its tail, which twitches and retracts when the tongue is pulled.

At over 6 feet 6 inches (2 meters), [NAME]'s tongue is twice as long as its body. Sticky, smelly saliva coats its tongue, which causes a tingling sensation when touched and can cause rashes if not cleaned off. It is used for capturing prey (mainly Bug Pokemon), reaching for berries, exploring its environment, attacking, and cleaning; although the effectiveness of its cleaning is questionable as its saliva leaves behind its smell. [NAME]'s saliva can also be used as a strong adhesive after cooking it. [NAME] remembers things by their texture and taste, although it apparently dislikes sour things. The tongue is both dexterous and powerful enough to lift people, as seen in the AG episode ''Deceit and Assist''. When capturing prey, [NAME] prefers swallowing them whole after paralyzing them with its tongue. [NAME] can be found in grassy plains and meadows.",Normal,,Normal,,1.0,0,"[""Normal""]",574,73,647

There are five blunt protrusions on top of its head, and it has structures resembling pads over its shoulders. It appears to be wearing a light purple tunic and kilt, as well as red boxing gloves and light purple boxing shoes. The gloves are actually masses of muscle. In between the tunic and kilt is a small, black area.

As its appearance suggests, [NAME] specializes in punching. It can throw punches that are too quick to be seen with the naked eye. These punches are said to be as fast as a bullet train. It starts attacking foes with combo punches from both sides before finishing with a single straight punch. A single straight punch by [NAME] can launch foes over 300 mph. By punching with a corkscrew motion, it is even capable of drilling through concrete. Even a light graze from its punches will result in a burn. However, [NAME] requires a break every three minutes while fighting. Despite the need for frequent breaks, it has an unwavering spirit and will never give up in a difficult situation. Usually found in urban areas, it is rarely seen in the wild. It often competes with Hitmonlee and Hitmontop.

In Generation II, Mach Punch was its signature move, but Tyrogue could still inherit it via breeding. Prior to Generation V, Iron Fist was [NAME]'s signature Ability.",Fighting,,Fighting,,1.0,0,"[""Fighting""]",565,10,575

[NAME] has shiny, oval, red eyes with two discernible upper eyelashes. Between its eyes is an oval spot in a darker shade of pink, from which [NAME] can expel Dream Mist. A pink or clear bubble comes out from the spot when [NAME] sleeps. Purple, five-petal flower markings with dark pink centers ornament much of its body, which glow faintly when it feeds on dreams. As mentioned in Sleep Style Dex, the reason for this is due to [NAME] feeling happiness from the dreams it consumes. It is able to constantly float in the air.

[NAME] is able to eat the dreams of people and Pokemon, as well as project these dreams by expelling Dream Mist. A person whose dream was eaten by a [NAME] will forget the dream's contents. It has been observed eating the dreams of Pokemon and humans even while it sleeps. The Dream Mist will be pink if the dream was pleasant. [NAME] can also seek out and cure people and Pokemon who are having nightmares by eating their dreams; the Dream Mist extracted from a nightmare will be black in color.

Sirfetch'd,865,Wild Duck,"[NAME] is an avian Pokemon that resembles a white duck, standing no taller than its pre-evolved form Farfetch'd and retaining its yellow beak, legs, webbed feet, brown eyes, black eyebrow-like marking, and its stubby tail. It has a crest on its head, consisting of three feathers standing upright. Its wings serve as humanoid hands, with the feathers at the end resembling fingers. It carries a massive leek in two parts, wielding the long, sharpened stalk as a lance and using the hard leaves as a shield.

It is said that [NAME]'s Evolution was attained by Farfetch'd who have experienced and survived many battles. [NAME] is known to be calm and collected, preferring to fight fairly. Due to its noble nature, [NAME] is often chosen as a motif for paintings; one famous painting in the Galar region shows a [NAME] dueling with an Escavalier. The leek it carries is its most prized possession; it is used as both weapon and food, and maintained for many years. Once the leek finally withers, [NAME] will retire from battle for good.

Grimer,88,Sludge,"[NAME] is a slimy, amorphous Pokemon, born from sludge in dirty streams or seabeds that are exposed to lunar radiation. It has two large eyes with beady pupils and a gaping mouth with a gray tongue. While it lacks any visible legs, it does have two arms with three digits on each hand. Its purple sludge body contains a variety of pungent bacteria, which are so potent that it renders soil barren and incapable of supporting plant life. It is constantly oozing a bacteria-rich fluid from all parts of its body. Should it run out of internal germs, [NAME] will die. Pieces of it often break off during travel and go on to become new [NAME]. When combined with another [NAME], it produces new poisonous compounds.

Due to its lack of a solid form, [NAME] is capable of squeezing into any space or crevices with relative ease. It uses this to penetrate sewage pipes and feed off of the filthy wastewater inside. Its population fluctuates based on the availability of waste, which is [NAME]'s main diet. It can be found in polluted lakes and streams, as well as within cities and factories where trash and industrial waste can be found. In recent years, thanks to efforts in environmental improvements and a decrease in their food source of waste, [NAME] is now facing extinction.

Unlike its pre-Evolution, it does not have discernable ears.

[NAME] live in packs. The one with its horns raked sharply towards the back serves a leadership role. Leadership is determined by fights within the pack. It is believed that [NAME] dreams about this leadership role while it sleeps. Its gut is full of toxins, which are used to create unique fire mixed with poison. This gives [NAME]'s fire a foul odor and the burns it inflicts will never heal. After finishing off its prey, [NAME] divides it evenly among its pack. [NAME] appears near rough terrain areas. Its howling induces shivering in other Pokemon, and often sends them scurrying back to their nests. In the past, people thought [NAME]'s howl came from the grim reaper.

It has four arms, each with a three-fingered hand. Its second pair of arms is typically kept tucked against its chest. It was shown in Pokemon Snap that, despite having legs, it can revert to a legless form. This grants it the ability to float.

[NAME]'s preferred locomotion is rolling, specifically, because it is a slow walker. It often rolls down mountain paths at high speeds exceeding 60 mph, crushing objects in the way and stopping by running into huge rocks should it build up too much speed. However, it will explode if it rolls into a river instead. [NAME] is known to be generally free and uncaring, not minding if pieces of itself break off, as it can restore itself over time.

If its tail or the Shellder attached to it is broken off, [NAME] will revert to its unevolved form, Slowpoke.

[NAME] has lost the capability to feel pain due to the Shellder's poison. While typically lazy and unintelligent, [NAME] apparently becomes inspired when the Shellder bites down on its tail. While it is capable of unleashing powerful psychic attacks, [NAME] is typically rather peaceful and usually prefers not to fight. Because it can no longer fish using its tail, it instead swims to catch its prey and allows the Shellder to feed on its leftover scraps. [NAME] tends to live near ponds, lakes, and seashores.

In the TCG, a resting [NAME] is shown to be able to detach and rotate its legs.

Occasionally, [NAME] will unleash a burst of speed to perform dynamic feats with its legs. Most of the time, it stands in a field watching the sun's progress, preferring a quiet life. Curiously, once every year on a certain day, groups of [NAME] gather from all over to form an evenly spaced ring or circle. No one knows the reason why they assemble in this formation, leading to many theories involving the position of the sun, the earth's energy, and other factors. Another curiosity is that the elemental composition of the rocks that form [NAME]'s body were found to match the bedrock of a land far away from its native habitat. [NAME] primarily makes its home in grasslands.

Steelix,208,Iron Snake,"[NAME] is a long, serpentine Pokemon with a silvery-gray body made of rock-like sections, which can possess chips and scrapes from fights and tunneling. Three of those sections have long rock spikes coming out of them on either side. It has a massive head mainly made up of its large, wide jaw with sets of large square teeth inside. Along its bottom jaw are ridges: there are two pairs of ridges on a male [NAME], while there is only one pair on a female. Several small, square lumps cover the underside of its lower jaw. Its eye sockets are slightly deep-set, and the eyes themselves are red. Its head has two long ridges going from the eyes up to the top of its head. The tip of its tail is conical with a blunt tip.

[NAME] burrows up to six-tenths of a mile underground, even further than its pre-evolved form Onix, and it can be found in mountains or caves. [NAME] can dig even towards the world's core. It easily chews through boulders with its powerful jaws, and its eyes are capable of seeing in the dark. Exposure to underground heat and pressures alongside its iron-rich soil diet has made its body harder than diamonds. [NAME]'s Evolution is said to have been the result of an Onix's composition becoming more diamond-like after living for about 100 years. As mentioned in Sleep, [NAME] is known to sleep in an upright postion. As noted by researchers, it can maintain this superb balance without even toppling over.",Steel,Ground,Steel,Ground,1.0,1,"[""Steel"",""Ground""]",587,11,598
Starmie,121,Mysterious,"[NAME] is an echinoderm Pokemon that resembles two violet starfish with faceted skin and five appendages each. The front starfish has a golden formation in the center. In the center of the golden casing is its red jewel core, an exterior organ which can glow in seven colors and has developed to resemble a cut precious stone. The second starfish is semi-attached to the back of the first and can spin 360 degrees. This rotational action is how [NAME] swims through the ocean. It can also launch itself out of the water and fly through the air for short periods, as seen in Pokemon Snap. 

From its core, [NAME] can emit electrical waves that are powerful enough to reach the furthest parts of the universe. The multi-color glowing of its core is also believed to be a method of communication with other members of its species. As seen in the OS episode ''The Water Flowers of Cerulean City'', the core will go dark if [NAME] is knocked unconscious and will sometimes flicker if [NAME] is low on health. Because of its body shape and habit of sending transmissions skyward, some people believe this Pokemon to be extraterrestrial. It has been known to cause headaches on people when approached. It is rarely seen in the wild since it requires a rare Evolution stone to evolve, but it can be found in the deepest parts of the ocean. It feeds by absorbing tiny plankton into its body while swimming, and it is preyed on by Lumineon.",Water,Psychic,Water,Psychic,1.0,1,"[""Water"", ""Psychic""]",574,77,651
Iron Thorns,995,Paradox,"[NAME] is a large, bipedal, robotic dinosaur-like Pokemon with green metallic armor plating covering its body and limbs. Its claws, lower jaw, parts of its abdomen, and tail tip are black. Part of its torso and legs seem to be transparent, revealing a glowing green substance of some sort. On its back are retractable spikes made of the same substance.

According to an article from a June issue of Occulture magazine, [NAME] has been sighted in a certain cave in Paldea. It bears a strong resemblance to Tyranitar, although it is said to be coolheaded and prefers to avoid unnecessary fights. It appears to be highly intelligent and is speculated to be a Tyranitar as it would appear 1,000,000,000 years in the future. Its name is said to come from a similarly described entity appearing in the Violet Book. When it falls asleep, it turns itself off, causing the green energy on its torso, legs, tail, and spikes to turn black.

According to AI Turo, [NAME] is an future Pokemon related to Tyranitar. However, according to a version of Professor Turo that appeared at the Crystal Pool, [NAME] is a counterpart of Tyranitar from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. [NAME] was brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Turo ten years ago. 200 years ago, Heath also encountered [NAME], as seen in the Violet Book, though it is unclear how it arrived there at the time.-",Rock,Electric,Steel,Rock,0.0,0,"[""Steel"", ""Rock""]",584,140,724

There are three yellow spots on its face, two of which surround its eyes, which are small black dots. It has short legs and toeless feet. [NAME] also has a hole on its rear similar to the draining hole of a flowerpot. It is often mistaken for a Grass, but its body is biologically closer to stone.

[NAME] is a good mimic, making it often mistaken for a real bonsai tree, though it can easily stand out in a dry environment that lacks greenery. As its green spheres dry out, their dull luster increases. It can remain in the same spot for a long time. It also has a habit of crying, not because it is sad or needing attention, but rather it is due to excess moisture in its body. As it cries, it expels both sweat and tears from its eyes; [NAME]'s sweat tastes a little salty, while the tears are slightly bitter. It dies if it gets too damp with this moisture. This habit also gets enemies to let their guards down. It prefers dry, rock-strewn areas, but it is not uncommon to see one in a garden. As suggested by Brock's [NAME], a very young [NAME] needs to be bottle-fed but can eat solid food when it matures. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, people tend to think [NAME] is crying in its sleep, and that something is wrong. However, it is merely expelling water from its body to adjust its body's fluid levels.",Rock,,Rock,,1.0,0,"[""Rock""]",604,73,677

Its eyes are red with three eyelashes, and four fangs protrude from its upper jaw. [NAME] is distantly related to Sneasler from the Hisui region.

[NAME] live in snow-covered areas and are notorious predators. [NAME] is famed for its speed and agility. [NAME] is also known for its intelligence and cunning nature, thanks to its brain having developed as it evolves from Sneasel. A scratch from [NAME]'s sharp, sword-like claws can cause frostbite. [NAME] travel in packs of four or five, with one of them acting as the pack leader. They hunt for prey such as Alolan Sandshrew, Alolan Vulpix, and species as large as Mamoswine, then divide up the prey amongst themselves. [NAME] can communicate with each other by carving patterns into trees, ice, and boulders, with over 500 distinct signs recorded. As mentioned in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] has been observed gesturing in its sleep, possibly trying to challenge someone in its dreams. It is speculated that [NAME] does this as a cunning tactic to prevent those around it from figuring out that it's asleep.",Dark,Ice,Dark,Ice,1.0,1,"[""Dark"", ""Ice""]",597,140,737

On its knees, halfway down its arm, and just behind where its forehead meets its face, are small red spots.

Due to its Evolution, [NAME]'s drill has turned into steel. [NAME] can straighten its entire body, allowing it to spin like a drill. It can cut through iron and steel plating and it can dig at speeds of over 90 mph (150 km/h). Known as the ""Drill King"", it uses its excellent digging abilities to build a complex network of tunnels for its nest at more than 300 feet (100 meters) below the surface. Its tunneling can be both beneficial and harmful to humans, as it can help workers with its swift digging prowess for tunnel construction, but it can be detrimental to underground structures, such as subway tunnels.",Ground,Steel,Ground,,0.5,0,"[""Ground""]",585,137,722
Rufflet,627,Eaglet,"[NAME] is a small avian Pokemon with a blue body. A large white plume of feathers covers its head and three tail feathers extend from its lower back. The feathery ruff extends down past its neck, covering the upper third of its body. Its face is blue with five pointed tips, resembling a mask and crown in contrast to the white feathers surrounding it. Extending from its forehead is a large feather, which is red on the lower half and white on the upper half. The split between the two colors on the feather resembles a zigzag pattern. [NAME]'s beak is short and wide, with large eyes on either side. Each eye has a thick black iris with a small white pupil. Its yellow legs and feet are large in comparison to the body. Each foot has four digits: one backwards, and three forwards.

The thick, black talons on its feet are strong enough to break even the hardest of berries, and crack Shellder to consume their insides. [NAME] also preys on Spewpa. [NAME] is extremely aggressive from birth and knowingly provokes opponents larger and more powerful than itself, including its own parent to gain acceptance. It sees this as a means of quickly getting stronger. The more times [NAME] faints or gets injured, the stronger it becomes. [NAME] will start crying whenever it loses a battle. As a result of the harsh environment of Hisui, [NAME] gains an additional Psychic when it evolves into Hisuian Braviary. [NAME] is a male-only species.",Normal,Flying,Fighting,Flying,0.5,0,"[""Fighting"", ""Flying""]",585,397,982
Golbat,42,Bat,"[NAME] is a large, blue, chiropteran Pokemon with purple wing membranes. It has small eyes with slit-like pupils, along with tiny triangular ears with purple insides, and a massive mouth with two fangs in each jaw. The fangs are smaller on a female [NAME]. While its mouth seems to be otherwise empty, [NAME] occasionally displays a long, purple tongue. It has short legs with long, tiny feet. Despite this, [NAME] can walk skillfully on the ground.

[NAME]'s fangs have hollow tubes (similar to straws) specialized for sucking blood. While they are strong enough to pierce thick hide, they are also unexpectedly fragile. There are some [NAME] that have missing fangs as a result of their hunger-fueled attempt to try drinking blood from Steel Pokemon. [NAME] feeds on the blood of both Pokemon and humans and is capable of drinking over 10 ounces (300 milliliters) of blood in one sitting. It is gluttonous, and drinks so much blood that its blood type will change to that of its victim following a feed. It occasionally gorges itself to the extent that it becomes too heavy to fly, leaving itself vulnerable in turn. However, it is also willing to share gathered blood with other members of its kind that are hungry. One particular [NAME] could utilize Supersonic to produce a magic mirror in its mouth for scrying to see things from a distance, even if walls or land are in the way. [NAME] is nocturnal and can be found quite easily in caves.

On each side of its head is a small, stylized wing, which is white and curves into a swirl at the base. Three blue, crystal orbs adorn its body: one on its neck and two on its tail.

[NAME] emits a gentle aura that gives it a mystical appearance. As seen in ''Pikachu's Rescue Adventure'', it can make its wings grow larger in order to fly, but otherwise moves through the air unaided. [NAME] hosts a large amount of energy within its body, which it can discharge through the crystals on its neck and tail. This causes its body to brighten and give off a different aura that changes the weather in its vicinity. As a result, [NAME] has been referred as a ""divine Pokemon"" since ancient times by agricultural peoples. [NAME] is a rare Pokemon that inhabits pristine seas and lakes. The lakes [NAME] lives in are usually filled with offerings from people in gratitude. It is said that a person who sees a [NAME] at the start of a year will be healthy for the whole year. As mentioned in Sleep, [NAME] is known to channel power and change the weather even while it sleeps.

Dewpider,751,Water Bubble,"[NAME] is a Pokemon resembling a spider with a water bubble over its head. Its head and most of its abdomen are dark gray, while its thorax and six legs are light green. All of its legs are thin with a knobby joint in the middle, and three of its legs are typically used to anchor the bubble on its head. Sometimes [NAME] will secretly swap which legs will hold up the bubble. The green on its thorax extends onto its abdomen in three triangular markings.

The head itself has large light blue eyes with darker pupils and sclerae, two blue bumps on top, and a light green mouth similar to a spinneret. There is an actual spinneret on the tip of its abdomen, which is shown as capable of producing both silk and water bubbles in the SM episode ''[NAME] Ascending!''.

[NAME] can only breathe oxygen dissolved in water, so the bubble over their head allows them to breathe on land. [NAME] uses the sticky silk it creates to form a sturdy water bubble that will rarely burst. Additionally, the bubble protects its soft head and can be slammed into both prey and enemies. If two [NAME] meet, they compare bubbles, and the one with the smaller bubble will move out of the way. It supports the water bubble that envelops its head with three of its legs.

The white markings are slightly higher up on the female [NAME] than the male. It has three fingers and toes, most of which are black. The only digits that are not black are its center fingers, which are orange instead.

[NAME]'s cheek pouches and fingers contain a poisonous fluid. However, the fluid squeezed from its finger is also a significant ingredient in remedies for lower back pain once diluted. The cheek pouches can be used to create an unnerving sound. When its opponents are distracted, it tries to stab them with its fingers. Despite this, it fights others only to ensure its own survival. [NAME] is a popular Pokemon due to being chosen as a mascot for a pharmaceutical company. It is also popular thanks to its strange cry and comical look. [NAME] and its evolved form, Toxicroak, are related to Seismitoad. [NAME] is said to have a dastardly nature, due to wielding poison. It usually lives in swamps and forested areas.

It has a bristly, down-like covering of brown feathers on its body and both heads. A male has black flexible necks, whereas a female has brown necks; both genders have brown legs. Each foot has four digits ending in a sharp claw. Both heads have an identical brain. However, it is believed that on occasion they may possess different brains. It is also theorized that the two heads communicate with some form of telepathy for coordination. Even when sleeping or nourishing itself with food and water, one head is usually awake and alert and keeps a keen eye out for enemies. The two heads switch turns every hour or so, with both only sleeping at the same time when they feel completely safe. Both heads have the same genes and battle together in perfect sync.

Due to its almost non-existent wings, it cannot fly very well. However, it has developed legs that make it a powerful runner. Reaching speeds of 60 mph (100 km/h), it energetically strides across the plains leaving large 4-inch (10-centimeter) deep footprints behind it. It can better maintain balance while running by raising and lowering its two heads. It is thought that the second head is a recent mutation.

The female [NAME] has a red marking on its mouth that resembles lipstick, while the male does not. It has flat arms that are wider towards the tip and four stubby legs at the base of its body. There are two eyespots on its black tail. Its eyespots are revealed to be capable of blinking and looking around using its tail in the Pokemon Stadium series. [NAME] is very protective of its tail, supposedly due to the belief that said tail hides a secret about [NAME], to the point where it will suddenly turn uncharacteristically aggressive if the tail is attacked.

[NAME] is usually a docile Pokemon that will never attack first. However, when it is attacked, it will inflate its body and initiate a counter-strike. When two or more of this Pokemon meet, they will attempt to outlast each other in a battle of endurance. However, since neither is able to attack, they may compete to see which can last without food. Because of its overprotective nature regarding its tail and hatred of light, [NAME] lives in dark caves. As mentioned in Sleep, [NAME] is known to keep its tail hidden even while it sleeps. However, it will drop its guard when deeply asleep, exposing its tail completely.

It has large, black eyes with pale green half-circle markings on the outer sides. Small bumps ring the top of its head, similar to hair. Its head is much larger than its thin, stem-like body. At the base, the stem splits into three green roots that act as feet. Three large mushrooms sprout from the center of its head. Each mushroom has a thin white stem and a darker ring of color around the base of the cap. The center and largest mushroom is light pink, while the other two mushrooms are smaller and a light purplish-blue. At night, [NAME] can make the spores filling its mushroom caps glow.

[NAME] likes dark, damp areas such as dense jungles, but changes locations every night to avoid depriving the plants in any one area of too many nutrients. In addition to locomotion, its roots are also used to communicate with other [NAME]. When in danger, it scatters spores that burst into bright, glittering sparks. The pulsing light of the spores can induce drowsiness. It is rumored that once when a group of [NAME] were disturbed and all threw out their spores at once, a plane passing overhead suffered a near brush with disaster..

It has a cream-colored abdomen divided into strips by thin divots. A rocky plate on its chest slightly overlaps its abdomen. There is a row of spikes down its back and they have a long tail with thin, black stripes.

[NAME] is a physically powerful Pokemon. It is recorded as being able to topple buildings with a sweeping blow of its tail, and its horn can bore through solid rock and shatter diamonds.

It is stated to be capable of passing unscathed through streams of magma (3,600 degrees Fahrenheit) and withstanding a direct blow from a cannonball without being harmed. However, because of this tough hide, it is insensitive. Despite its well-developed brain, it can be forgetful. [NAME] lives in rough terrain like in caves or on top of mountains.

Despite its small size, [NAME] has extraordinary strength and can knock out even well-trained Pokemon if they are unprepared. The combination of its cute appearance, mannerisms, and fluffy fur make it very popular. However, [NAME] actually dislikes being touched and will flail its powerful arms if it is embraced. [NAME]'s flailing is powerful enough to break thick tree trunks. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, [NAME] is filled with power despite sleeping. It is often seen flailing about and moving constantly while sleeping. As in the Poke Problem segment of ''Living on the Cutting Edge!'', [NAME] is powerful enough to break through walls of steel.

It is capable of teaching itself swordsmanship at an impressive rate. As shown in Pokemon Adventures, [NAME] can extend its blades at will to attack opponents from behind. This Pokemon inhabits mountainous areas. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, [NAME] has been observed sleeping in a formal position with one knee up.

Floatzel,419,Sea Weasel,"[NAME] is an orange Pokemon resembling an anthropomorphic otter or weasel with longer arms than legs. It has four fingers on each hand and three toes on each foot. Its feet are small in comparison to the rest of the body. It has two pointed blue fins on its arms; two aligned, backward-swept, pointed fins on its head; and two tails, which can spin like a propeller in a similar way to its pre-Evolution's. It has cream colorations on its forehead, eyelids, muzzle, belly, and the tips of its forelimbs and tails. It also has one cream, slightly protruding, oval-shaped spot on its back if it is female, and two of these spots if it is male. There is an orange teardrop shape near the bottom of its belly, and a pattern of two black triangles on the edges of its muzzle. It has small, sharp canine teeth, the top two of which can be seen when its mouth is closed.

[NAME] has a yellow flotation sac, which seems to behave similar to rubber. The flotation sac goes in a kind of ring behind its head, down in front of its arms, then back behind its rear above the tails. [NAME]'s sac developed as a result of chasing prey in the water. To help it dive, [NAME] can deflate its flotation sac, and then inflate it once again when it wishes to surface. [NAME]'s sac allows it to not drown, even in stormy seas. Along with hunting for food, [NAME] can use its swimming capabilities to assist in the rescues of drowning people, by carrying them like a raft. It is often seen near fishing hamlets.",Water,,Water,,1.0,0,"[""Water""]",616,9,625
Mareanie,747,Brutal Star,"[NAME] is an echinoderm Pokemon with a purple, stalk-like body and head. It has blue eyes with yellow pupils and sclerae, and three pointed teeth. The body consists of two sections; the top section is slightly smaller and overlaps the lower. On top of its head is a starfish-like collection of ten tentacles. All of the tentacles reach the ground, except for the one directly in front, which is shorter and leaves its face exposed. The tentacles are light blue and covered in purple spines. On top of its head is a purple area with a collection of spikes with a larger, yellow spine in the center.

[NAME] is able to regenerate any body part overnight, except its head. The lost limbs have a very bitter, astringent flavor, and thus they cannot be eaten as food. Bruxish feeds on [NAME], which in turn eats the branches of Corsola — except in Galar, where it has not yet learned to prey on them. [NAME] also eats broken-off Pincurchin spines, despite the risk of getting electrocuted. It uses the spike on top of its head to poison its prey and uses its tentacles to either trap its prey or deal the final blow. In the SM episode, ''The Sun, the Scare, the Secret Lair!'', it is seen attaching itself with all of its tentacles and releasing poison through its spines. The poison causes numbness and intense itching. [NAME] live in groups and are found in beaches and the bottom of oceans.

[NAME] and its Evolution, Toxapex, are the only known Pokemon that can have Merciless as an Ability.",Poison,Water,Poison,Water,1.0,1,"[""Poison"",""Water""]",613,12,625
Porygon2,233,Virtual,"[NAME] is a rounded, magenta, artificial Pokemon that shows similarities to a drinking bird. It has a relatively flat bill and large, round eyes. Its legs are simple ovoid growths along its sides, and its tail widens towards the middle. Its bill, legs, tail, and underside are blue.

[NAME]'s Evolution from Porygon was the result of it being upgraded from the most cutting-edge technology available. It was upgraded to work in space for planetary development reasons, although its inability to fly limits this ability. It is artificially intelligent and capable of learning new behaviors on its own, including information it does not need to know. It can also speak a strange language only other [NAME] can understand. As a result, it will sometimes perform motions or abilities that are not in its programming. It is generally found in computers or in labs and other buildings working with people. It can survive in a space vacuum, though cannot move very well in zero gravity. In ancient Hisui, people were confused about [NAME] and its evolutionary relatives due to them arriving through space-time distortions and being the product of far more advanced technology than what was available at the time.

[NAME] and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pokemon capable of learning the moves Conversion and Conversion 2. Additionally, prior to Generation V and in Generation IX, [NAME] and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pokemon that can have Download as an Ability.",Normal,,Normal,,1.0,0,"[""Normal""]",561,9,570
Mankey,56,Pig Monkey,"[NAME] is a small, simian Pokemon, similar to a New World monkey. It is bipedal and has a round body covered in whitish, shaggy fur. Its nose is similar to a pig's snout, and it has narrow, red eyes and triangular ears with brown insides. [NAME]'s three-fingered hands, two-toed feet, and the tip of its curved, prehensile tail are brown.

[NAME] specializes in physical fighting and is very aggressive and short-tempered. When angry, it begins shaking and its breathing turns rough. Its rage peaks quickly, preventing its victim from being able to flee. It will rampage until it falls asleep, but its anger remains in its dreams. This causes it to wake up and become furious all over again. However, this constant release of stress grants it a long life. [NAME] can be found in the mountains, where it lives in treetop colonies. If one becomes enraged, the whole colony rampages for no reason. If it loses sight of its colony or if it is left alone to rage, its loneliness causes it to become infuriated.

According to the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team games, [NAME]'s preferred food is chestnuts. However, [NAME] usually lacks the dexterity to peel them. It becomes agitated and rage after attempting to peel a chestnut's spiky shell. Additionally, it also appears to be fond of bananas, as seen in the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''Showdown at the Po-ke Corral''. As mentioned in Pokemon Sleep, it is rare to find a [NAME] sleeping without an angry look on its face.",Fighting,,Fighting,,1.0,0,"[""Fighting""]",615,10,625
Slither Wing,988,Paradox,"[NAME] is a large, moth-like Pokemon with four legs. It appears to have compound eyes that are two shades of red, and there is a red spiny horn-like structure on each side of its face. The fuzz on its body and legs is smoky white and messy. Its thorax is navy blue in the center, and its tail-like abdomen is teal with black dots. It has six leaf-like wings that are orange in color with yellow-orange tips and small green diamond-shaped marks, but they do not seem to be strong enough to allow it to fly. Even though it is mostly quadrupedal, it can stand on two legs, mostly during battles.

In an article from an August issue of Occulture magazine, it is stated that there have been few sightings reported of [NAME], whose name is taken from that of a similar creature described in the Scarlet Book. It shares traits with Volcarona, and some theorize that it may have been revived from fossils of a prehistoric era. However, no Volcarona fossils of that era are known to have been found.

According to AI Sada, [NAME] is an ancient Pokemon related to Volcarona. However, according to a version of Professor Sada that appeared at the Crystal Pool, [NAME] is a counterpart of Volcarona from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. [NAME] was brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Sada ten years ago. 200 years ago, Heath also encountered [NAME], as seen in the Scarlet Book, though it is unclear how it arrived there at the time.",Bug,Fighting,Bug,Fire,0.5,0,"[""Bug"", ""Fire""]",595,268,863
Frillish,592,Floating,"[NAME] is a jellyfish-like Pokemon resembling young royalty. Regardless of gender, it has a round head with a crown-like tuft, and five tentacle-like appendages—two function as arms and three serve as the lower half of its body. It has oval eyes with white pupils, and a collar around its neck, which is significantly larger on a male [NAME]. It has invisible poison spikes on its appendages. As a male, it is blue, with smooth appendages and a triangular crown.

[NAME] is a hadopelagic Pokemon which lives in dens about 5 miles (8 kilometers) under the sea surface. Because of this, it can cope with extremely dark and highly pressurized sea conditions. It is carnivorous; it gently floats around in waves until it can strike its prey. It makes its victim numb with the use of its poison spikes and takes it to its deep den. Its arms are filled with tens of thousands of poisonous stingers. There is a legend where [NAME] are said to have been created from transformed residents of a sunken ancient city. [NAME] preys on Magikarp and Lanturn. Female [NAME] are stated to have slightly longer stingers on their arms.",Water,Ghost,Water,Ghost,1.0,1,"[""Water"", ""Ghost""]",613,204,817
Charmander,4,Lizard,"[NAME] is a bipedal, reptilian Pokemon with a primarily orange body and blue eyes. Its underside from the chest down and the soles of its feet are cream-colored. It has two small fangs visible in its upper jaw and two smaller fangs in its lower jaw. A fire burns at the tip of this Pokemon's slender tail, which has blazed there since [NAME]'s birth.

The flame can indicate [NAME]'s health and mood, burning brightly when the Pokemon is strong, weakly when it is exhausted, wavering when it is happy, and blazing when it is enraged. It is said that [NAME] would die if its flame were to go out. However, if the Pokemon is healthy, the flame will continue to burn even if it gets a bit wet and is said to steam in the rain. As shown in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] is known to sleep while curled up. Supposedly, [NAME] is drawing warmth from the flame on its tail. During quiet nights, the sounds of its flame can be heard by listening carefully while [NAME] sleeps. [NAME] has four different sleep styles: ''Crackling Sleep'', ''Tummy-Rub Sleep'', ''Tummy-Up Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''.

[NAME] can be found in hot, mountainous areas. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy. However, it is found far more often in the ownership of Trainers. As shown in Pokemon Snap and New Pokemon Snap, [NAME] exhibits pack behavior, calling others of its species if it finds food and watching the flames on each other's tails to ensure they don't go out.",Fire,,Fire,,1.0,0,"[""Fire""]",612,9,621
Stantler,234,Big Horn,"[NAME] is a quadrupedal, cervid Pokemon. It has a tan pelt with a cream-colored belly and a few spots on its back. Its tail is large, short, and round, and each of its legs ends in a black hoof. It has a large, brown nose and a pair of pale cream-colored antlers, each with a black orb in the center. The shape of the antlers and the black orbs causes them to resemble eyes. [NAME] can distort reality and create illusions with its antlers by subtly changing the flow of air around them. Staring into them creates an odd sensation, as if one is being sucked through them, and one may become so dizzy that it is impossible to stand. The orbs on the antlers have a pleasant scent, which can induce a bewildering effect on people. The orbs can also be ground into a powder that aids in sleeping.

[NAME]'s strange antlers were very valuable as works of art, and as such, the species was nearly hunted to extinction. [NAME] live in herds in temperate, mountainous forests; these herds are sometimes led by a Wyrdeer. As shown in the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''The Little Big Horn'', a baby [NAME] that is separated from its herd and frightened will instinctively produce an illusion of a big, stampeding herd to scare away perceived threats. In the past, [NAME] lived in tougher environments with more enemies, which strengthened its psychic powers and allowed it to evolve into Wyrdeer.

[NAME] and its evolved form, Wyrdeer, are the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Psyshield Bash.",Normal,,Normal,Psychic,0.5,0,"[""Normal"", ""Psychic""]",613,333,946
Rhyperior,464,Drill,"[NAME] is a large, brownish-gray Pokemon with two horns: a larger one on its nose, and smaller one above it. The upper horn is even smaller on a female [NAME]. The larger horn is divided into three sections by two thin slanted rings, making the horn resemble a drill. Its hide is partially covered by orange, rocky plates on its head, shoulders, arms, waist, and knees, similar to that of the protector used to evolve it from Rhydon. The hide of [NAME]'s armor has a mysterious substance. It has blade-like protrusions on its elbows and has holes in the palms of its hands which work as cannons or guns. It has three blunt, gray fingers on each hand, two gray toes on each foot, and a club-like tail. Its eyes have red irises with what appears be two thick, rectangular rocks above each one, resembling heavy eyebrows.

[NAME] is even stronger than Rhydon, although its brain structure is smaller. It can insert rocks and boulders into its arms through the holes in its hands and fire them as projectiles. Occasionally, it will insert and fire Geodude or Roggenrola by accident. [NAME] has a very hard carapace; it can survive volcanic eruptions, cannot be scratched even by a masterwork sword, and deflect most incoming attacks. By parrying certain attacks, [NAME] can throw its opponent off balance before it drills into the foe. [NAME] lives far up in the mountains.

It has dark purple eyes with purple, triangular markings over them similar to stylized eyelashes. On top of its head is a large, light green calyx. The calyx has short leaves on the front and back, two large leaves out to the sides similar to pigtails, and a short stem on the top. The right leaf has two yellowish-green spots on it. The upper part of its torso has short ruffles at the top similar to a dress. Its wide hips are made up of six segments and resemble the flesh of a mangosteen. Its slender arms have slightly rounded hands with no visible digits, and its legs have pointed tips.

While it has a delectable fragrance, this Pokemon also has a tomboyish personality that can make it hard to get along with. [NAME]'s scent is a popular antiperspirants used by humans and helps others feel invigorated. [NAME]'s peeled rind can be used for stomach pains. Its calyx has hardened, allowing it to play with other Pokemon without worrying about being damaged. However, the leaves spin as [NAME] moves and often strike nearby objects. It apparently does not care what it hits, and even uses the calyx as a form of attack. Foes are struck with the leaves first, then kicked by one of [NAME]'s equally hard legs.. It also uses those legs to protect itself from its natural predator Corvisquire. [NAME] has are known to bounce around the forests it lives in.",Grass,,Grass,Fighting,0.5,0,"[""Grass"", ""Fighting""]",607,205,812

It has yellow rectangular scales covering its back and tail, and a pattern of black and yellow stripes on its chest. Its face has a long snout, red square cheeks, a pattern of two red triangles resembling nostrils, and a hook-like upper jaw. When [NAME] opens its mouth, three pairs of sharp teeth can be seen lining its lower jaw.

Atop [NAME]'s head is an orange mass of fire energy shaped like a nest, with yellow squares patterning it. This ""nest"" contains a yellow, glowing, egg-shaped fireball on top, borne out of [NAME]'s fire energy and overflowing vitality. [NAME] can control the fireball, sending it out and using it for its moves. As shown in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] and its evolutionary relatives are known to sometimes sleep with one eye open. The fireball on [NAME]'s head never falls off even as the Pokemon sways rhythmically in its sleep.

[NAME]'s internal flame sac has a valve that connects to its vocal cords. As a result, [NAME] lets out guttural cries as it releases fire from its mouth. Its voice can hardly be described as beautiful; moreover, its voice becomes more destructive as it breathes more powerful fire.

Zacian,888,Warrior,"In its Hero of Many Battles form, [NAME] is a large cyan lupine Pokemon with yellow eyes, a tan underside, a lean frame, a pink tail, and pink braids going down the side of its body. Two pink fringes of fur are present on its back. There are battle scars on its shoulders, hips, back, and forehead, which reveal a tan coloration under the blue fur. Half of its left ear is also missing.

It is believed to be either the elder sister or rival of Zamazenta. In the past, [NAME] was feared and respected by the people of Galar. 3000 years ago, it worked together with Zamazenta and two young humans to save the region from Eternatus and the Darkest Day it created, defeating the Gigantic Pokemon and forcing it back into slumber, which also caused pieces of its body imbued with its power to rain down throughout Galar in the form of Wishing Pieces and Wishing Stars. It can also turn itself into a statue and slumber for eons alongside Zamazenta in the Slumbering Weald. [NAME] can also cast illusions, including a projection of itself, even while it slumbers. Additionally, it is capable of flying. Even though it is not capable of Dynamaxing, [NAME] may still go berserk when bombarded by Galar particles. As years passed, both [NAME] and Zamazenta were forgotten by history, however, Professor Sonia proved their existence by writing her first book: ""Galar: A History"", which details the discovery she and the player had in Stow-on-Side.

Cursola,864,Coral,"[NAME] is a coral-like Pokemon. The lower body of [NAME] resembles that of Galarian Corsola, albeit broken apart to reveal an ectoplasmic ""body"" which has taken the shape of a ghost. This ectoplasm surrounds [NAME]'s core, which is a white sphere with a face like that of Galarian Corsola, and has an oval-shaped opening with three inward-facing notches where the core is. Two half-circle openings similar to eyes are located above [NAME]'s core. Together, the three openings resemble a screaming face with a sad or pained expression. On its ectoplasmic body, two small branches below the core serve as its arms and one small branch on its forehead serves as a horn. It has three long branches each on both sides of the head, and three more on its lower back. All of its branches can split apart when it attacks.

[NAME]'s overflow of ectoplasm is the result of a long and continuous process of absorbing spirit energy from other creatures. The ectoplasm causes anyone who touches it to become stiff like stone. [NAME] can be seen wobbling while wandering, possibly because it enjoys being so light-weight. [NAME] are known to gather together under a full moon, and send their branches into the sky. The reason for this behavior is unknown — one hypothesis suggests that it is a ritual of release, shedding the energy they've gathered from others; while another hypothesis posits that this is a form of communication between the [NAME].

It is a female-only species with no male counterpart.

[NAME] also holds a flower with five rounded petals that can be red, yellow, orange, blue, or white. The flower has three yellow stamens and a long green stem with a single leaf. The color of the flower it uses remains the same, even after evolving. The more gorgeous the flower, the more power that it contains for [NAME] to use. [NAME] is unable to use moves by itself, but when it synchronizes with flowers, it becomes able to use Grass moves, with White Flower [NAME] being capable of easily synchronizing with flowers of other colors. [NAME] can restore withered flowers to perfect health by drawing forth what power is left in them. It can also draw forth the latent capabilities of Grass types. It flutters around and cares for withered flowers by giving its own power to them. If the flowers of a well-tended flower bed bloom, [NAME] celebrates with an elegant dance. However, it will never forgive anyone who tramples a flowerbed and will attack them mercilessly.

These eyes lack eyelids and pupils, and stay open when [NAME] blinks or sleeps. [NAME]'s mandibles point downward and reside at the bottom of its face, where they closely resemble tufts of hair. It is capable of producing silk from these mandibles, enabling it to hang from trees.

At 4 inches (0.1 meters) tall, [NAME] is one of the shortest Pokemon in existence. In fact, it is too small to generate its own electricity, so it attaches itself to larger Pokemon and feeds off their static electricity. More than often it prefers sticking on Yamper's hindquarters. It will also make its way into houses and feed off electricity in electrical sockets. All of the energy it absorbs it stores in an electric pouch on its body. As seen in the BW episode ''Oshawott's Lost Scalchop!'', [NAME] is not especially aggressive, but will defend itself if bothered. In the episode ''Crisis at Chargestone Cave!'', it's shown that if [NAME] is unable to find a source of energy, it will be unable to move and be put in serious danger.

[NAME] can be found in heavily polluted bodies of water, factories and cities, where groups can gather to consume trash that people throw away into the streets. However, [NAME]'s population has declined due to recent environmental improvements and extermination efforts. This has led some to believe that it will go extinct at some point; sludge ponds are being built to prevent its extinction.

When it removes the sticks, the leaves resemble a mohawk, with a dark green color on the ends. It has several sharp teeth.

[NAME] can use its two sticks to create a rhythmic beat. The faster a rhythm [NAME] creates, the more respect it earns from its peers. Often, when it drums out rapid beats in battle, [NAME] will get so caught up in the rhythm that it does not realize its opponent has been knocked out. This action will also cause [NAME] to even ignore its own Trainer’s commands. To further develop its sense of rhythm, it constantly uses it in daily life. It can always feel a beat, and it walks while swaying back and forth to this beat, along with drumming with its sticks. As seen in the JN episode ''A One-Stick Wonder!'', [NAME] can groom its friends to cheer them up; this is its way to show friendship and trust.

These powers are used to move its body, as opposed to its weak muscles. It also uses its psychic powers to hold up its head, which is too heavy to be supported by its neck. Due to its continually growing brain, its head becomes larger with age. It is said to have an excellent memory and can remember everything that it has experienced since hatching as an Abra, to the time of its death, and has an IQ that exceeds 5,000. It is found in urban areas.

It has a triangular, wing-shaped head; a relatively short body; and a long, laterally flattened tail similar to a newt's. The dorsal side of [NAME]'s flattened head and the anterior half of its body are a dark navy color, which fades to a teal on its posterior end and tail.

The area surrounding their dance is enveloped in a magnetic field. Once the sun rises, it returns home, where it sleeps nestled with other [NAME]. There have been many sightings of [NAME] during the morning aftermath of the full moon. In the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''[NAME] Tales'', [NAME] is depicted as an extraterrestrial Pokemon. [NAME] is known to be popular thanks to both its adorable look and behavior. As mentioned in Pokemon Sleep, anyone who sees a [NAME] using Metronome while sleeping will receive happiness.

It has wide, flat white wings with a brown loop marking toward the bottom. In between its wings is a white tuft of fuzz. It has four spindly legs with round feet.

[NAME] is capable of detecting the aura of living things, such as plants, people, and Pokemon. It uses this ability to predict the movements of its opponents. [NAME]'s diet consists of pollen and nectar, drinking it through its long proboscis. Any pollen it does not finish is stored in its fur. It collects nectar and pollen from flowers, which are found by the color and brightness of their auras. However, when a living creature is excited, its aura resembles a flower in full bloom. As a result, [NAME] tends to gather around beings feeling strong emotions. When [NAME] draws close, it will painfully poke them with its long proboscis. This Pokemon can be found in fields and meadows but is sometimes attracted to towns or buildings by the emotions of living beings. Loving nectar and pollen, it often gets into skirmishes with Butterfree over food. It is known to be drawn in by Fomantis's sweet scent and Gossifleur's pollen. Spinarak and Pineco are natural predators of [NAME].

[NAME] is one of the shortest Pokemon in existence. Additionally, it is the lightest Bug Pokemon in existence.",Bug,Fairy,Bug,Fairy,1.0,1,"[""Bug"",""Fairy""]",605,76,681
Diggersby,660,Digging,"[NAME] is a bipedal Pokemon that resembles a large, portly gray rabbit. Its most notable feature is its two ears, which resemble muscular forearms, complete with three-fingered paws. The ears are mostly gray with pink interiors, whereas the paws at the tips are brown. There are three brown spots above each ear-paw. A pointed protrusion in the middle resembles an elbow. These ears are as powerful as an excavator, being strong enough to lift objects weighing over a ton and reduce dense bedrock to rubble, and prove to be an invaluable asset in [NAME]'s digging.

[NAME]'s remaining limbs are small in comparison to the ears. The fur of the upper paws is white, while the feet are brown; each paw has three digits. A sash or belt-like band composed of thicker, woolly fur surrounds its waist; it tends to tuck its paws into this fur. This fur is known to retain heat exceptionally well and was used by people for heavy winter clothing. This sash is divided into sections: brown on its sides and yellow on the front and back. Its short tail is also yellow and protrudes from the back section of the sash. [NAME]'s face has a large brown muzzle with prominent cheeks. The coloration around its muzzle extends down onto its neck and resembles beard stubble. It has two large upper incisors, three whiskers on each cheek, a tiny, pink nose, and eyes that appear to perpetually squint.

The middle spike of each line is about twice as long as the others are. A fluffy white puff forms its tail.

[NAME] tends to find a spot it likes and stay there, even returning to the same spot if moved. Once all the food in its favorite spot has been consumed, it will continue to stay there to the point of starvation. Its body is coated with a viscous fluid that allows it to stay on land for a week without drying out. This fluid is also beneficial to people as a moisturizer. If stepped on, it will expel its fist-like organs and smack the perpetrator. It particularly hates having its mouth or spikes touched. Tourists dislike [NAME] due to its appearance and lifestyle and often accidentally step on [NAME]. This creates a need for part-time jobs on beaches chucking this Pokemon back into the sea. However, people in Alola have already taken to throwing the Pokemon back to the sea where it can find food when thin. [NAME] is shown to have a symbiotic relationship with Pelipper, which carries it after scooping it from the water.

[NAME] keeps its true form hidden to ensure its safety and takes on the appearance of other Pokemon to frighten off enemies. It can let loose pitch-black shock waves against its targets. Sometimes it will take the form of a silent child in order to search for food. It has been known to occasionally replace normally talkative children. As seen in its movie debut, the tail of an unpracticed [NAME] may remain when it takes on a human form, and if the tail is touched, it will revert to its true form. [NAME] is mischievous and loves to surprise others.

Prior to Generation VII, [NAME] and its evolved form, Zoroark, were the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Night Daze.

Its arms have five clawed fingers each, and its feet three clawed toes.

[NAME] opens its powerful jaws to intimidate its foes and viciously shakes its head once it clamps down on foes or prey. Because it has difficulty supporting its weight out of the water, it has been known to move on all fours. However, when hunting or fighting, it is agile and fast, due to its powerful hind legs. [NAME] can rarely be found living near the water's edge. As shown in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] and its pre-Evolutions are known to sleep with one eye open and rest only half of its brain at a time — a practice known as unihemispheric sleep.

Its main body is pale pink with a thick, dark pink stripe down the front and back. It has a stubby tail and two short legs.

In order to achieve Evolution, [NAME] stores up energy gathered by photosynthesis. It is nocturnal, so during the day, it spreads its leaves wide to catch the sunlight. During the night, it spends its time searching for a new spot to sleep for the next day. It will not stay in the same spot for more than a day due to the danger involved. If anything bothers it while it is gathering sunlight, [NAME] will fiercely attack it. The reason is that [NAME] hates its naps being disturbed. When regularly exposed to sunlight, it grows up with vivid coloration. Though it excels at long-range attacks, it will rarely use those that require it to use its stored photosynthetic energy. [NAME] can give off a sweet and refreshing scent. Bug  Pokemon like Cutiefly are known to gather near it due to its scent. Trainers who own [NAME] tend to give it a flowerpot, allowing it to sunbathe in peace.",Grass,,Grass,,1.0,0,"[""Grass""]",612,73,685

In Showdown Mode, [NAME] stands and jumps on its now-unfolded third set of legs, and swings them to attack. [NAME] utilizes its Showdown Mode to fight all-out, being capable of quickly subduing its foes in this mode. However, it cannot be in Showdown Mode for too long, as it places a huge strain on its body.

The mud that collects around its hooves enhances its grip and power. Notably, it allows [NAME] to travel rough terrains without slipping.

Despite this, [NAME] have been seen roaming in Galar and Paldea, suggesting that its population is slowly recovering from near extinction.

Dhelmise,781,Sea Creeper,"[NAME] is a Pokemon made up of an anchor and a ship's wheel, held together by a mass of green seaweed. The anchor is a rusty brown mottled with blackish spots. The seaweed, which is [NAME]'s true body, partially envelops the thick, curved bottom of the anchor in a zigzag fashion, leaving empty spaces that look like sharp teeth. The seaweed continues upward to cover the anchor's thin shank and the spindle of the wheel. Five individual strands of seaweed trail off this small hub in a star shape.

The ship's wheel is lavender on the outside with a yellow inner rim. It is affixed to the back of the spindle by its center and able to rotate freely. The noticeably damaged wheel features six spokes and four handles, all of which are yellow. There are two lavender stubs where the other handles should be. A simple compass, resembling an eye, is set into a yellow ring-shaped component on one side of the wheel; mirroring this is an identical ring on the opposite side, though nothing is set into it.

[NAME] prefers large prey, such as Wailmer and Wailord. The heavy anchor can be swung with enough force to knock out its prey in a single blow.

[NAME] is a relaxed Pokemon who loves fuss from its Trainer. Even though it is more docile when domesticated, it can be very stubborn at times in the wild. It instinctively sneaks into rocky holes or pots, and if it gets sleepy, it steals the nest of a fellow [NAME]. When threatened, it will spurt ink from its mouth to cover itself before escaping, allowing it to protect itself and its young from danger. [NAME]'s ink obscures vision and contains substances that dull predators' sense of smell. [NAME] also uses this ink on its prey, before its suction cups hold the prey tightly. Its ink can also be used as a cooking ingredient. Besides ink, [NAME] sometimes uses its rock-hard head on its foes. Prior to Generation VIII, Octazooka was its signature move, but other Pokemon could still inherit it via breeding.

[NAME] is normally found in oceans and caves. For a long time, people refused to believe [NAME] was an Evolution of Remoraid, because of the extreme physical differences between the two. It is thought to be a distant relative to Omastar. In New Pokemon Snap, an [NAME] can be seen about to be preyed on by a Seviper.",Water,,Water,,1.0,0,"[""Water""]",614,73,687
Archeops,567,First Bird,"[NAME] is a large, avian Pokemon that bears traits of both birds and reptiles. Its featherless, scaly snake-like head is red with a green stripe running along the top. Its mouth is filled with sharp teeth. Its eyes are white with black pupils and no irises. Its body is covered with frayed-looking yellow and blue feathers designed for flight on its arms and legs enabling all four of its limbs to act as wings. All of these ""wings"" bear sharp claws. It has a ring of smaller green feathers on the ankles. Its tail is completely red and featherless except for a fan of blue feathers at the end, and as with the ''Archaeopterygiformes'', it has fully-movable vertebrae in its tail instead of a pygostyle. Its plumage is very delicate.

It is capable of flying, but is more adept at running, taking a running start to take flight with its weak wing muscles. To achieve flight, [NAME] must run nearly 25 mph (40 km/h) as it builds up speed over a course that is 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) long. [NAME] can hunt more efficiently when on the ground. [NAME] is known to be intelligent, hunting for its prey in packs. One [NAME] first corners the prey before another swoops down on it. It can outrun even an automobile. It has the intelligence to work with its partners to catch prey. [NAME] are extinct but can be revived via fossils. [NAME] is omnivorous; along with hunting for prey, it was shown eating fruit in the BW episode ''[NAME] In The Modern World!''.

[NAME] and its pre-evolved form, Archen, are the only known Pokemon that can have Defeatist as an Ability.",Rock,Flying,Rock,Flying,1.0,1,"[""Rock"",""Flying""]",639,11,650
Corsola,222,Coral,"[NAME] is a small, pink, roundish Pokemon with branch-like growths on its back, which are similar to coral. There is a smaller, blunt horn on its forehead, and it has oval-shaped black eyes and a smiling mouth. It has a light blue underside, which speckles towards the sides. Its four legs and two arms are blunt and stubby.

Smaller Pokemon like Horsea and Luvdisc are sometimes sheltered by [NAME]'s branches and even offer it protection from foes. [NAME]'s horn is a prized material, commonly used for jewelry and carving, as seen in the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''A [NAME] Caper!''. Some people keep [NAME] branches as charms to promote safe childbirth. [NAME]'s branches glitter very beautifully in seven colors when they catch sunlight. If any branch breaks off, this Pokemon grows it back in just one night.

Found in the warm shallow waters of southern seas, [NAME] requires clean water to live. If its habitat is dirty, the growths on its back become discolored and degenerate. However, when it is healthy, its growths regularly shed and grow back; it is able to regrow them over the course of a single night. It forms large social groups. Occasionally, these groups get so large that people may live atop them, as is the case in Pacifidlog Town. 

In the Alola region, Mareanie and Toxapex are natural predators of [NAME], preying on its branches. If pursued by them, [NAME] will sometimes snap its own branches off as a diversion. Conversely, Mareanie and Toxapex do not prey on [NAME] in the Galar region, having not developed a taste for its branches.",Water,Rock,Rock,Water,0.5,0,"[""Rock"", ""Water""]",628,76,704
Sneasler,903,Free Climb,"[NAME] is a bipedal Pokemon that resembles both a cat and a weasel. Its body is dark gray with purple accents around its face and ankles. Its fur is longer on its shoulders. It has long arms that extend to just above its ankles. On each arm is a dark spot, and its hands have three long claws tipped with poison, which are black with three red lines streaking through. Like its pre-evolved form, it has sharp, narrow eyes with red pupils and black markings resembling eyelashes on the edges. It has yellow diamond-shaped gems on its chest and head, and three sharp toes on each foot. Its left ear has a long black and red feather that extends down to its back; it also has red and black feathers for a tail.

[NAME]'s Evolution was the result of Hisuian Sneasel adapting to life on cliffsides in the frozen highlands of Hisui. Despite [NAME]'s lanky build, it possesses great strength owing to its vicious claws. Due to its severe poison and deadly physical power, no other Pokemon species could defeat [NAME] in its habitat. Using its claws, [NAME] is capable of climbing up walls and cliffs with ease. Unlike its counterpart, Weavile, it prefers to be alone instead of living in packs.

A special [NAME] is worshiped in Hisui due to her being descended from one of the 10 ancient Pokemon who received a blessing from Arceus. In particular, she is one of the Ride Pokemon who resides in the Coronet Highlands, watched over by the warden Ingo. This special [NAME] is known to assist humans.

Quagsire,195,Water Fish,"[NAME] is a light blue, bipedal, amphibious Pokemon. Its head is broad and round, having little neck to distinguish it from the rest of its body. It has a wide mouth and tiny, black eyes. A wavy, purple stripe runs down its back. Along its spine is a dark blue fin, which is larger on the male than on the female. [NAME]'s hands and feet both have three digits. Its outer layer of skin is slimy and slippery. [NAME] shares many similarities with its Paldean relative, Clodsire.

[NAME] is carefree and sluggish by nature, although it is protective towards Wooper. An unintelligent Pokemon, it tends to bump its head inadvertently while swimming and seems not to care. It hunts for food by leaving its mouth wide open in water and waiting for its unaware prey to blunder in. Because [NAME] does not move, it does not get very hungry and can afford to wait for its food. As shown in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] leaves its mouth open even as it sleeps. It is said seeing a [NAME] asleep with its mouth wide open is a sign it’s possbily waiting for prey, while it dreams. [NAME] lives in clean bodies of freshwater, as well as muddy swamps. During the day, [NAME] avoids sunlight by submerging itself in the water.

In the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''Once in a Blue Moon'', wild [NAME] are shown to have an annual celebration at Blue Moon Falls when the moon is full. There they attempt to shoot round objects they have collected to the top of a waterfall with their attacks, to see who can launch their objects the highest, with the apparent target being the moon.",Water,Ground,Water,Ground,1.0,1,"[""Water"", ""Ground""]",625,76,701
Gible,443,Land Shark,"[NAME] is a small, bipedal dragon-like Pokemon that is primarily grayish-blue. It has a big mouth filled with sharp teeth, no neck, and arms that start at the outer edges of its jaws. Its stomach is relatively small compared to its mouth. A red underbelly stretches from its abdomen to the bottom of its jaw. [NAME] has two horns that resemble jet or plane engines, each with a light blue stripe in the middle. It has a single light blue stripe wrapping around its back, and a short tail. On top of its head is a dorsal fin, which has a notch on it for the male. Its dorsal fin is strong enough to carry a person.

In the past, [NAME] lived in the tropics. [NAME] appears to be a good digger, making deep holes for homes in caverns warmed by geothermal heat. This heated environment allows [NAME] to survive even during the winter. It has also been seen huddling with other members of its species to stave off the cold, although it enjoys play-fighting with them as well. [NAME] is typically sighted in rocky areas, such as mountains.

[NAME] has tremendously strong jaws that it uses to bite enemies and prey alike, dragging the latter back into its nest. However, even while biting, it often hurts itself because of clumsiness. This sometimes causes its teeth to chip and fall off in the process, but [NAME] is never bothered by this because the teeth will grow back after a few days. As shown in the animated series, [NAME] is capable of eating through most types of metal.

In Generation IX, [NAME] and its evolved forms are the only known Pokemon that can have Rough Skin as an Ability.",Dragon,Ground,Dragon,Ground,1.0,1,"[""Dragon"", ""Ground""]",625,332,957
Mismagius,429,Magical,"[NAME] is a purple, ghost-like Pokemon. It has a round head with elaborate tufts resembling a witch's hat atop it. The tips of the tufts are paler than most of the body. It has a thin, red mouth that resembles the letter ""W."" Below its head, [NAME] has a short, thorax-like lump from which its body connects. Three elliptical red spheres surround the upper portion of [NAME]'s body. There are extensions on the sides of its lower body with the foremost ones tattered compared to rear ones. This gives [NAME] the appearance of wearing some kind of cloak.

[NAME] usually shows up without warning to cause havoc on unsuspecting humans or Pokemon. If it is powerful, [NAME] can use advanced incantations for various purposes, such as causing misery or happiness. Due to this, people often seek to capture [NAME] as if their life depends on it, solely to make someone fall in love with them. There is a custom on inviting [NAME] to one's home, usually to ward off misfortune with its spells. However, this can also lead to disaster should [NAME] ever be provoked. People that hear its cries will usually receive headaches and hallucinations. As shown in the DP episode ''Malice In Wonderland!'', [NAME] can put its victims to sleep, and cause them to enter a strange dream world without their noticing. If [NAME] falls asleep or is knocked out, the victim will wake up. [NAME]'s magical powers can be manifested offensively in the form of telekinesis or controlled darkness. It can sometimes be found roaming around lakes and mountainsides at night.",Ghost,,Ghost,,1.0,0,"[""Ghost""]",609,73,682
Pinsir,127,{{tt|Stag Beetle|STAGBEETLE before Generation III}},"[NAME] is a bipedal, coleopteran insectoid Pokemon with a wide, dull-brown body divided into segments by thin lines. On top of its head is a large pair of gray, spiky pincers on top of its head. In its mouth are many long, flat teeth arranged horizontally, and it has triangular eyes. Capable of seeing color to some degree, [NAME] appears to be attracted to the color green. Its legs are short and thick, while its arms are long and thin. It has three claws on each hand and foot; two of its toes face forward and one backward.

[NAME] can use its pincers to crush, toss, bludgeon, or tear opponents; lift things twice its weight; and shatter logs. Captured prey is kept in place by the piercing thorns and sheer strength of [NAME]'s horns and will not be released until they are torn in half. [NAME]'s horns are quite flexible as depicted in the Bandai Pokemon Carddass Cards where they have a wide range of motion. In addition to hunting prey, it's shown in the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''A Sappy Ending'' that it enjoys tree sap. [NAME] lives deep in the temperate forests and jungles, where it burrows underground or hides in the treetops on nights cold enough to render it immobile. In Sleep, [NAME] burrows itself into the ground to sleep during cold nights but its pincers can be seen sticking out of the ground as it slumbers. In Alola, it has a rivalry with Vikavolt and gets along with Heracross. [NAME] are known to judge each other based on their pincers. The pincers determine its popularity with the opposite gender based on how more thick and impressive it looks.",Bug,,Bug,,1.0,0,"[""Bug""]",638,73,711
Greavard,971,Ghost Dog,"[NAME] is a quadrupedal canine Pokemon whose body is covered in long, shaggy pale grey hair that reaches down to its legs. Its large snout peeks under the hair covering most of its head, and contains a black triangular nose and a wide, jagged mouth powerful enough to shatter bones. Rather than having actual teeth, [NAME] instead has serrated lips. It has stubby limbs and large round feet, and it has a slight waddle to its walk. Its rear has a thin wispy tail. On the top of its head is a protrusion resembling a candle, which burns with a small purplish-yellow light.

[NAME] usually rests underground, with the candle-like part of its head left uncovered, as it waits for people to come nearby. If it is approached, it jumps out of the ground and lets a spooky cry that may unintentionally startle most people. [NAME] is friendly, affectionate and easily gets lonely. It is really easy to befriend, and will forever follow anyone who gives it the slightest of attention. However, it is advised not to play with [NAME] too often, as it is known to slowly and unwittingly drain the life-force of those near it. It is rumored that [NAME] is the reincarnation of a dog Pokemon that had never interacted with a human and died in the wild. [NAME] primarily lives in boreal mountains.

In Generation IX, [NAME] and its evolved form, Houndstone, are the only known Pokemon that can have Fluffy as an Ability.",Ghost,,Ghost,,1.0,0,"[""Ghost""]",587,393,980
Exeggutor,103,Coconut,"[NAME] is a tall, bipedal Pokemon that resembles a coconut tree or palm tree. Its body and legs are light brown with thin black rings and its legs are thick with two-toed feet. There is a light yellow paw pad on each foot's underside. It has thin, green leaves sprouting from the top of its body. [NAME] has three round, light yellow heads that resemble coconuts, each with different facial expressions.

[NAME]'s heads think independently and don't appear interested in one another, so it makes a lot of noise as each head speaks its mind. They still appear to get along, though, for they never squabble amongst themselves. If all the heads want to go in a different direction, its body is unable to move. They are able to communicate telepathically as well and sometimes use it to come to a joint decision. It uses psychic powers to fight, and since all three heads are capable its power is tripled. If one of these heads grows too large, it falls off and groups together with others to become an Exeggcute. In the OS episode ''The March of the [NAME] Squad'', [NAME] also has been seen in groups of its own kind, meaning that it is not a solitary Pokemon. [NAME] has been referred to as ""The Walking Tropical Rainforest"" or ""The Walking Jungle"". It can be sluggish during cloudy days due to the lack of sunlight. Being the result of an Evolution via Evolution stone, [NAME] is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in forests and jungles.

Butterfree,12,Butterfly,"[NAME] is a lepidopteran insect Pokemon which resembles a vaguely anthropomorphic butterfly with a purple body. Unlike true insects, it only has two body segments and four light blue legs. The upper pair of its legs resembles small, three-fingered hands, while the lower pair resembles long, digit-less feet. [NAME] has two black antennae, a light blue snout with two fangs underneath, and large, red compound eyes. Its two pairs of wings are white with black venation. Two oval scales on a female [NAME]'s lower wings are black, but they are white on a male.

The wings of [NAME] are coated with poisonous scales that easily fall off continuously as it flies. If inhaled, it results in several status conditions. Using this powder, it will defend Caterpie from bird Pokemon. This powder also repels water, enabling it to fly and gather honey even in the rain. [NAME] can use its sensitive antenna to detect the odors of blooming flowers six miles (ten kilometers) from its nest in search of nectar, which it carries with the hairs of its legs. Sometimes, it has territorial disputes with Cutiefly over fields of flowers. It also consumes sap from trees pierced by Heracross, as seen in the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''A Sappy Ending''. [NAME] is found in temperate forests and jungles, but it is also observed in the episode ''Bye Bye [NAME]'' flying near the ocean as part of its migratory breeding pattern. As shown in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] is known to sleep while flapping its wings. It tends to accidentally scatter highly toxic dust while sleeping.",Bug,Flying,Bug,Flying,1.0,1,"[""Bug"",""Flying""]",609,75,684
Delibird,225,Delivery,"[NAME] is a red, avian Pokemon with a white, hollow, and bag-like tail. Its face and chest are covered in white feathers with two, three-pointed crests above its eyes. Black markings surround its circular eyes, and it has a light yellow beak and feet. There is a single white spot on its stomach. Its feet have two digits each.

[NAME] is omnivorous and carries collected food bundled up in its tail, which it is frequently seen holding or tucking under its arm. It normally gives this stored food to its chicks, although it is generous enough to also share its food with other Pokemon and even humans, especially those lost or stranded in the mountains. Due to its omnivorous nature, however, it will sometimes offer bug Pokemon for these humans to eat. If attacked, it will also retaliate by throwing its food at the opponent. As mentioned in Sleep, [NAME] is known to sleep while occasionally reaching inside its tail to pull something out. Prior to Generation IX, [NAME] was the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Present by leveling up. Present allows it to carry special items in its tail that may cause damage or heal its opponent. In a flock, the [NAME] with the largest tail is its leader. [NAME] tends to live in mountainous regions, making its nests over sharp cliffs; notably around Mt. Everest. Iron Bundle shares a resemblance to [NAME] and is believed to be a [NAME]-based machine built by an ancient civilization.

Leafeon,470,Verdant,"[NAME] is a mammalian, quadrupedal Pokemon. Its body is tan with dark brown paws. It has a multitude of small green sprouts growing all over its legs, chest, and back, with the longest one on its head, in front of four tan tufts of fur. [NAME]'s green ears and tail resemble tattered leaves. It has brown eyes and a small, brown nose.

This Pokemon's cellular structure is similar to plants, which allows it to perform photosynthesis and purify the air around it by sleeping under the sunlight; it gets its energy in this way instead of eating. It is a pacifistic, quiet Pokemon, preferring not to fight, though it will sharpen its hard, leafy tail for the occasions it needs to. The tail's sharpness is said to exceed that of a human-crafted sword, being able to cut down a large tree with one hit. [NAME]'s aroma is similar to fresh grass in its youth; as it ages, this fragrance bears more of a resemblance to fallen leaves. The aroma is favored in Galar, where it is used to create a popular perfume. It lives in lush forests that have clean rivers. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, the air produced by a sleeping [NAME] can help any Pokemon sleep deeply.

During the development of Generation II, the earliest iteration of [NAME] was a quadrupedal Grass-type Pokemon with root-like feet, several markings across its body, and a short fringe above its eyes. Its eventual redesign for Generation IV is evidenced by [NAME]'s early Japanese name in the data of Pokemon Battle Revolution matching the same name as this early iteration from Generation II, known as Rīfi '''(リーフィ)'''.",Grass,,Grass,,1.0,0,"[""Grass""]",620,9,629
Rampardos,409,Head Butt,"[NAME] is a large, dark-gray, dinosaur-like Pokemon resembling a Pachycephalosaurus. It has a pearl-like dome crowning its head, which obstructs its red eyes. It has blue stripes, one on its tail, and one on each of its knees and wrists. It has various spikes: one on each knee, two on the blue-collar on its neck, two short ones on its nose, and four on its head. Two of these head spikes are bigger than the other two. [NAME] is well-known for its deadly physical strength which is often employed within its fierce head-butting attacks.

A charging [NAME] can knock down virtually anything with one hit. 100 million years ago, it lived in jungles, where it ruthlessly chased its prey while tearing down trees in its path. [NAME] has the personality of a brute. It enjoys barging into objects with its head to train its strength and reflexes. This resulted in its skull growing a foot thick and harder than steel, which prevents it from fainting if it crashes into anything, even another charging [NAME]. Long after its passing, ancient people would dig up its well-developed skull fossil and use it as a helmet. However, because its skull grew so thick, its brain became even smaller than that of Cranidos, leading to theories that its stupidity led to its extinction. Its fossils have been found near those of Bastiodon, suggesting that these two lived in the same habitat, likely as enemies. Very little was known about [NAME]'s biology in ancient times. There were records of a [NAME] that escaped after being revived and evolved, destroying a skyscraper in the process.",Rock,,Rock,,1.0,0,"[""Rock""]",611,9,620
Tinkaton,959,Hammer,"[NAME] is a pink humanoid Pokemon, with large, white arms and short, stumpy toeless feet with light pink circles underneath. Its arms have five fingers each, with the thumbs having the same color of pink as the body. It has steel plates on its hips that resemble outturned pockets. Its face has silver eyes with thin eyelashes, and a large mouth with two square teeth-like growths on the upper lips. On top of its head is a large, pinkish-white growth resembling a twin-tail hairstyle, which droops over [NAME]'s back and has darker pink zigzag patterns accenting it.

[NAME] wields a crude, gigantic metal hammer that weighs over 220 pounds (100&nbsp;kg) and is larger than its own body. The hammer appears to have been made using the old hammer [NAME] had as a Tinkatuff for the base, with several scraps of metal colored in varying shades of gray and purple welded onto it. The hammer also has a spiked beige axe-like structure on top. Although the hammer is heavy, [NAME] can swing it with ease by using its whole body. As depicted in HZ109, [NAME]'s Evolution occurs once Tinkatuff successfully forges the gigantic hammer.

[NAME] is intelligent and has a reckless personality. It swings its hammer at rocks to send them into the sky, aiming to hit flying Corviknight. Because of this, Flying Taxis in Paldea use Squawkabilly rather than Corviknight. This Pokemon will also steal anything that it wants and take it back to its dwelling. It has been observed using its hammer like a bed to sleep on.

Skarmory,227,Armor Bird,"[NAME] is a silver-gray, avian Pokemon with a long, metallic blue neck, legs, and tail. It has yellow eyes, a pointed beak with several pointed teeth, and a triangular crest on its head. [NAME]'s entire body is coated in an extremely sturdy steel armor. There are red feathers under the sheaths that cover its sharp wings, and each feather can be moved independently. Its wings are actually hollow, allowing it to travel up to 185&nbsp;mph (300&nbsp;km/h). Its feet have three toes on them, two in front and one in back, and its tail has hooked ends.

Its steel wings become tattered and bashed in from repeated battles, but once a year the battered wings grow back completely. This process restores the cutting edges of its feathers, which are sharper than any human-crafted sword. Its skin and feathers are solid due to being raised in very harsh conditions. Its nests are usually found in thorn bushes, where continual scratching of a young individual's skin will eventually harden it into the strong, armor-like state associated with its adult stage. However, water can cause [NAME]'s hard body to rust easily, so it stays in its nest on rainy days. In ancient regions where these Pokemon are common, warriors would use the sharp feathers that fell off [NAME] to craft swords. It is a popular Pokemon that is used for heraldic designs, and in Galar, it has violent territorial clashes with Corviknight. In Blueberry Academy, [NAME] is used for the school's Flying Taxi service.

In Generation V, Steel Wing was its signature move, but other Pokemon could still inherit it via breeding.",Steel,Flying,Steel,Flying,1.0,1,"[""Steel"", ""Flying""]",606,140,746

On top of its head is a very long curled tuft of fur that extends down its back and is a darker shade of pink on the end, resembling a tail. It also has an actual tail on its backside. 

[NAME] is capable of levitating itself, as opposed to walking. In an article from an October issue of Occulture magazine, [NAME] is described as a creature lurking somewhere in a Paldean forest, having the appearance of a Jigglypuff but with a ferocious aggression that leads it to attack anyone who comes near. Its primitive appearance and savage nature have prompted rumors that it could be a Jigglypuff from 1,000,000,000 years ago. [NAME] is named after a creature in the Scarlet Book that is described as having a distinctive tail and scream. As seen in ''HZ'', it is a poor singer compared to its contemporary relative, due to the fact that it ends up screaming loudly instead.

According to AI Sada, [NAME] is an ancient Pokemon related to Jigglypuff. However, according to a version of Professor Sada that appeared at the Crystal Pool, [NAME] is a counterpart of Jigglypuff from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. [NAME] was brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Sada ten years ago. 200 years ago, Heath also encountered [NAME], as seen in the Scarlet Book, though it is unclear how it arrived there at the time.",Fairy,Psychic,Ghost,Fairy,0.0,0,"[""Ghost"", ""Fairy""]",624,205,829
Clawitzer,693,Howitzer,"[NAME] is a crustacean Pokemon that resembles a bright blue shrimp. Its body is divided into several segments by black ridges and there are three small spikes behind its head. It has semicircular, yellow eyes, a black stripe across its face divided into parts, and four pointed mandibles. Its tail consists of three pointed fins: two black ones and one bright blue one. It lacks legs but has two clawed arms. The left claw is smaller and is dark blue with a black stripe along the back and a yellow tip. The right claw is a pincer larger than [NAME]'s body. The pincer is dark blue with a pair of thin, yellow antennae on top, three overlapping segments with a black stripe along the back edge, and four black spikes attached to the back of the last segment. The movable lower portion of the pincer is yellow, as is the inner portion of the pincer's last segment, which has three stripes patterning it.

[NAME] are a territorial species, known to fiercely battle against each other. [NAME]'s massive claw can suck up water and launch it as compressed cannonballs capable of piercing tanker hulls. By using the gases inside its body, water can also be expelled from the nozzle on the back, which allows it to travel at speeds of up to 60 knots. It is also a powerful user of aura-based attacks. The feelers on [NAME]'s claws can detect the location of its prey. The claw itself is packed with meat, which can be used as a cooking ingredient.

Stoutland,508,Big-Hearted,"[NAME] is a heavyset canine Pokemon with a talent for rescuing people lost at sea or in the mountains. On its face, it has cream-colored fur that forms voluminous, white-tipped plumes and a three-pointed crest. The plumes are so long that they run the length of its body and bunch close to it. It has tufty, pointed ears with dark blue insides, a black nose surrounded by short black whiskers, and small eyes that are nearly hidden behind its facial fur. Its plump body is covered with shaggy fur that is dark blue along the back and grayish-blue toward the legs. Its face and paws are light brown, and each paw has three toes with white claws. Blue paw pads can also be seen on each paw in Pokedex 3D Pro.

[NAME] has an intelligent, good-natured, valiant, and trustworthy disposition, being a partner of choice for many. Its fur is thick enough to protect itself and others against freezing temperatures. Due to this, every household in cold regions kept a [NAME] for warmth in the past. [NAME] is known to rescue humans that are either stranded in the mountains or at sea. [NAME] found in Alola look fairly uncomfortable, however. In Alola, [NAME] is used as a Ride Pokemon called [NAME] Search to locate hidden items. [NAME] can do this thanks to its strong nose. [NAME] enjoys spending time with humans and can warm up to them in just three days. [NAME] has been used by parents as babysitters to watch their children. It is known to be very proud of its impressive mustache, the reason being due to its length determining [NAME]'s social status among its species.",Normal,,Normal,,1.0,0,"[""Normal""]",626,137,763
Charjabug,737,Battery,"[NAME] is a small, cuboid Pokemon resembling an insect. Its body consists of three square segments. The last two sections have a thin, ring-like marking and a stubby brown leg on each side. Each eye is covered by a blue screen and is only visible when it glows. Two short, yellow spikes extend from the front square: one on each side of its rectangular mouth. The mouth itself is gray and has two jaws that close sideways, shaped like a lightning bolt when open.

[NAME] is often found half-buried in earth or leaves, munching on large quantities of humus. The sturdy shell covering [NAME]'s body protects it from attacks, allowing it to eat peacefully. This diet helps [NAME] evolve into Vikavolt. In its body is an electric sac, which it uses to store electricity generated by digesting food. The electricity it stores could run a household for a whole day and can be shared with other Pokemon. People on camping trips are grateful to have a [NAME] around. It can discharge electricity from the tips of its jaws to attack especially persistent opponents. [NAME] will zap anyone who accidentally steps on it. As shown in the SM episode ''Rise and Shine, Starship!'', it can send sound waves to communicate with nearby Grubbin. Vikavolt is known to clasp [NAME] in between its legs and use it as a battery to enhance its Electric moves, unless it is in an aerial battle. As mentioned in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] releases electricity while it sleeps. The reason is due it still digesting the meal it consumes.

Zygarde,718,Order,"[NAME] is a green and black Pokemon whose form depends on the percentage of [NAME] Cores and [NAME] Cells it has assembled. [NAME] is responsible for monitoring the ecosystem of the Pokemon world for abnormalities, It has been referred to as a ""guardian of the ecosystem"" and ""protector of the ecosystems"" due to this role. It also is capable of reversing the effects of Xerneas's Fairy Aura and Yveltal's Dark Aura, thus ensuring the equilibrium of the planet and the cycle of life and death are kept in check. It can also use its Cells in attacks, either shooting them as arrows at its targets, or sending them crawling along the ground towards its targets as waves.

In addition, it has two caudal fins, the bottom of which resembling the butt of a gun and the top resembling the hammer. All of its fins except for the dorsal fin are white. For a long period of time, due to their vast anatomical differences, no one believed that [NAME] evolved into Octillery.

[NAME] is well known for its ability to shoot jets of water out of its mouth with incredible accuracy and distance. It uses its abdominal muscles to do so, often to shoot down prey, such as Burmy, out of the air. The water attack can reach its prey from over 300 feet (100 meters) away, even when the prey is moving or flying. Because of this, [NAME] is referred to as the ""sniper of the seas."" When threatened, it can also shoot water to propel itself backward.

[NAME] tends to travel by attaching to Mantine's fins or in large groups of its own kind. It attaches itself by using its dorsal fin, which acts like a suction pad.

It will then take the victims of its attacks back to its nest for food. [NAME] nests in temperate forests and misty wooded areas.

Its shield-like face is as hard as diamond, and capable of repelling any attack. When multiple [NAME] line up side by side, their faces form a wall that nothing can break through; this was how they protected their young. In stark contrast to its impenetrable frontal defense, it is helpless when attacked from behind. Because its facial bones are so hard, they were initially mistaken for its spine by researchers who found its fossils. [NAME] has lived in the same habitats as Rampardos, as evidenced by their fossils frequently being found together, possibly from fighting each other to the death.",Rock,Steel,Rock,Steel,1.0,1,"[""Rock"", ""Steel""]",616,268,884
Gastly,92,Gas,"[NAME] has no true form, due to 95% of its body being poisonous gas, with the other 5% believed to be made up of the souls of those who died from the gas. However, it consistently appears as a black, spherical Pokemon surrounded by a purple haze. [NAME] has a wide, pink mouth with two visible fangs. Though its eyes seem to extend past its round body, visible eyelids surround them.

It produces a faint, sweet smell. The toxic gas surrounding the main body can induce fainting and suffocation, and it is capable of enshrouding an enemy of any size. [NAME]'s gaseous form makes it one of the lightest Pokemon in existence. The ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''The Tower of Terror'' suggests that [NAME] has a playful personality, often frightening and playing pranks on people for fun. However, in the episode ''A Shipful of Shivers'', it shows a willingness to preserve or pass on the memories of departed humans. It is also shown in ''The Ghost of Maiden's Peak'' changing form and creating illusions, and it is capable of phasing through solid objects and forming tangible hands out of its gasses. [NAME] can be found within caves and old, dilapidated buildings, but may also be seen outdoors during nighttime. Its gaseous body will dwindle away when exposed to strong winds, so they huddle together in decent-sized groups under house eaves to avoid the wind.

This Pokemon lives in tropical and temperate forests.

Although [NAME] typically appears as green with yellow stripes, it is known to possess various non-Shiny color variations. A purplish variant of [NAME] appeared in the PTS episode ''The [NAME] Caper'', as a TCG card, and in the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon series; the purplish [NAME] in the latter also has light-green outlines rather than yellow. Blue, red, and brown variants of [NAME] have made a singular appearance in the TCG. Whether these variants are an example of it changing color or if they are different kinds of [NAME] is unclear.

It has also been shown that [NAME] can awaken a dormant power from within itself that causes the spikes on its chest to become surrounded by a red aura.

It has large, blue eyes, a black nose, and a wide mouth, as well as long, black, floppy ears with yellow insides. [NAME] has a yellow udder with four pink teats. All four of its limbs end in black, cloven hooves, and its long tail is tipped with a black sphere. In ''The Young Flame Strikes Back!'', a smaller [NAME] was shown without any horns or teats, implying that this is what young [NAME] look like.

In every generation except for Generations VI and VII, Milk Drink is the signature move of [NAME]. Prior to Generation VI, [NAME] was the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Milk Drink. The milk that it produces is sweet and very nutritious, and can be used to heal Pokemon and ill or weary humans. Drinking a large amount of [NAME]'s milk will cause the Pokemon or person to gain weight and develop stomach pains. The taste and nutrition of its milk improves with the quality of the pastures it lives in, and the taste itself changes with the season. It can produce over five gallons of milk per day, which in turn can be turned into yogurt or enjoyed unchanged by children and adults alike. [NAME] can become ill if it is not milked every day. [NAME] lives in grasslands, and is also raised on farms. [NAME] has been supporting the lives of people and other Pokemon since ancient times with its ability to produce milk.",Normal,,Normal,,1.0,0,"[""Normal""]",637,9,646
Cetitan,975,Terra Whale,"[NAME] is a large cetacean Pokemon. It has a white piscine body with large forelimbs and legs, and pink accents around its eyes, forepaws, and tail. The tail has two pairs of fins protruding from either side. [NAME] also has a gray underside with circular white accents, as well as gray accents on its armpits, and two large gray claws on each foot. It has five horns: two on the top of its head, and three around its large, wavy mouth. The singular horn on its upper jaw allows it to gather ice energy and freeze its surroundings. When [NAME] opens its mouth, rows of long, teeth-like plates can be seen lining its jaws.

[NAME] has tough muscles, which allow it to support its weight and attack with immense physical power. It also has a thick layer of subcutaneous fat, which helps it migrate around snowy areas. It lives in pods and shares habitats with Avalugg. As mentioned in ''Breathe Out'', in Paldea, [NAME] mainly live on top of Glaseado Mountain, and their main diet consists of snow and ice. It's also mentioned that [NAME] can use echolocation to find and communicate with others of its kind through sound waves, and that the sounds it makes is said to be similar to that of a flute. In ''Ice Battle! Cold-Eyed Grusha'', [NAME] is shown to be able to slide around ice and snow on its belly to move faster across said terrain.

Clefable,36,Fairy,"[NAME] is a tall, pink Pokemon with a vaguely star-shaped body. It has long, pointed ears with dark brown tips and black, oval eyes with wrinkles on either side. A curled lock of fur hangs over its forehead, much like its long, tightly curled tail. On its back is a pair of dark pink wings; each wing has three points. Its hands have three fingers each, and its feet have two clawed toes and dark pink soles.

[NAME] is a timid, nocturnal creature that flees when it senses people approaching and is one of the world's rarest Pokemon. Its sensitive ears can distinctly hear a pin drop from one kilometer to 1,100 yards away. Because of its acute hearing, it prefers to live in quiet, mountainous areas of which it is protective. It has also been seen at deserted lakes during a full moon. Using a bouncy gait, it can walk on water and sometimes appears to be flying using its small wings. In the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''Clefairy Tales'', [NAME] is depicted as an extraterrestrial Pokemon. According to one tradition, seeing a pair of [NAME] ensures a happy marriage. Some scientists believe [NAME] stares intently at the moon because it is homesick. There is also a legend to this, which tells of how it listens for the voices of its kind on the moon during clear and quiet nights. As mentioned in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] is known to sleep in remote places during quiet, moonlit nights. It is theorized that [NAME] is dreaming about its friends and distant homeland during its peaceful slumber.

Ceruledge,937,Fire Blades,"[NAME] is a bipedal, humanoid Pokemon. Its body is primarily black, though some regions on its head, arms, and legs are dark blue. From each side of its head, a sharp pale blue protrusion extends outward, giving the impression of ears; from the back of its head, a blue and purple fire burns upward, resembling the plume on a knight's helmet. Its eyes have pink irises and wisps emanating from its white pupils. A plate with three pink indentations on its center covers its face. Instead of hands, [NAME] wields purple-cyan blades created from both fire and spectral energy—specifically, the lingering regrets of the fallen. These blades can grow into great swords in battle, increasing [NAME]'s power in the process. Almost all of [NAME]'s body is covered in an old set of purple and blue armor.

[NAME] is merciless and will do anything to win a battle. It prefers to do close-quarters combat, with a mix of sneak and surprise attacks. By using its quick speed to locate a foe's blind spots, it will then move closer before slashing them with its large swords. Any cuts from [NAME]'s swords will cause wounds that leak life energy, which the swords then absorb. It can focus its bitter feelings into a fiery slashing attack, or imbue its sword strikes with darkness or magical energy. As seen in the HZ episode ''Liko and Amethio'', the blades can emit heat even when retracted.

Ribombee,743,Bee Fly,"[NAME] is a tiny, insectoid Pokemon with a large head, slightly smaller body, and thin arms and legs. It is covered in fluffy, yellow hair and has a white face and lower body, and a tuft of hair on its back. It has big eyes with one white and one brown square speck in the center. Over its eyes are white hairs similar to eyelashes, and it has two black antennae. Around its neck is a brown scarf with a needle-like projection on the front. Two wings nearly as large as its body sprout from its back. The wings are white with three brown loop designs near the base. Its four thin limbs have bulbous hands or feet. It is one of the shortest Pokemon in existence.

[NAME] uses its fluffy hair to hold pollen it collects from flowers. Rain turns its hair dirty and its pollen damp, so it only visits fields if the weather remains clear. When storms are on the horizon, [NAME] hide in tree hollows and wait stock-still. The pollen and nectar it collects are used to form balls called ""Pollen Puffs"". These balls can be used as food or relieve tiredness with a soothing effect. The Alolan people sell Pollen Puffs as valuable nutritious supplements. When [NAME] senses a human or Pokemon feeling sad, it will cheer them up using handmade pollen puffs.

A special [NAME] in Alola acts as the Totem Pokemon for Mina's trial in Seafolk Village. This [NAME] possesses Z-Power, an energy that originates from Ultra Wormholes and takes the form of a golden, flaring aura. The reward for defeating Totem [NAME] and completing the trial is a Fairium Z.

Scyther,123,Mantis,"[NAME] is a bipedal, insectoid Pokemon. Its body is primarily green and has a thin, cream-colored section between its head, thorax, and abdomen. Female [NAME] have larger abdomens than male [NAME]. Its reptilian head has two narrow, triangular eyes and three blunt horns extending from its forehead. Its arms end in large, white scythes, which it uses for both hunting and fighting. Two pairs of cream-colored wings extend from its back. While these wings do allow [NAME] to fly, it rarely does so. [NAME]'s thighs have large, upward-pointing spikes. Its feet are tall, rounded, and conical, almost extending to its thighs; each foot ends in three small, white claws on its front side.

[NAME] is an adept hunter that tears at its prey with its scythes. Thanks to its green coloration, it can camouflage itself well in the grasslands and forests where it lives. Humans rarely encounter wild [NAME] in these areas, however. Said to be like a ninja, [NAME] can move so quickly that it cannot be followed, increasing the effectiveness of its scythes. It maintains the sharpness of its blades through battle as well as by cutting through hard objects, such as trees; it can cut down a massive tree with just a single slice, although it cannot penetrate Tarountula's elastic threads. The ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''Tracey Gets Bugged'' showed that wild [NAME] form swarms with a single leader chosen through combat. When a challenger successfully defeats a current leader and replaces it, the defeated leader is exiled from the swarm. In ''Showdown at Dark City'', it was shown that [NAME] becomes aggressive when faced with the color red.",Bug,Flying,Bug,Flying,1.0,1,"[""Bug"", ""Flying""]",631,12,643
Dratini,147,Dragon,"[NAME] is a reptilian Pokemon with a blue serpentine body and a white underside. It has white, three-pronged fins on the sides of its head and a white bump on its forehead, which is its horn growing. Above its round, white snout are oval, purple eyes.

[NAME]'s life energy is constantly building so it is always growing, and can reach lengths of over six feet (2 meters). As it grows, it sheds its skin regularly; it hides behind a rapid waterfall during the process to protect itself, since the new skin is soft in texture. The shed skin can be tanned and used to create luxury boots. [NAME] has been referred as the ""Mirage Pokemon"", because its existence was originally thought to be nothing more than a myth. [NAME] was first discovered by a fisherman who spent 10 hours attempting to capture it. A small colony has also been found underwater, further confirming its existence. [NAME] live near or in bodies of water with a rapid flow, such as the pools at the bottom of waterfalls. It lives a quiet life underwater, eating any food that sinks down to the bottom.

As mentioned in Sleep, [NAME]'s sleeping habits used to be a mystery due to how rare it was. However, in recent years, [NAME]'s sleep styles have been discovered and well documented. This is due to trainers who have obtained [NAME] and observed its sleeping habits. The four different sleep styles discovered are called ''Coiled Sleep'', ''Wriggly Sleep'', ''Uncoiled Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''.

In Generation II, [NAME] and its evolved forms were the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Outrage, but other Pokemon could still inherit it via breeding.",Dragon,,Dragon,,1.0,0,"[""Dragon""]",628,73,701

It has diamond-shaped ears with beige insides, black eyes, a round, black nose, and two pointed teeth protruding from its upper jaw. Its head, muzzle, and chest are covered in shaggy, beige fur, except for two oval sections around each eye and ear. Long tufts of fur grow behind its elbows and around its ankles. Its underside is black, and it has a billowing, beige tail that is bent in the middle. Each paw has three toes and a round, pink pad.

[NAME] is a fiercely brave and loyal Pokemon. It is capable of running 10,000 kilometers in 24 hours with a speed and grace reminiscent of flight. In Generation II, Extreme Speed was its signature move. [NAME] has long been admired for its beauty and speed, and anyone who hears its bark will grovel before it. The source of its power is a flame blazing wildly inside its body. Being the result of an Evolution via Evolution stone, [NAME] is rarely found in the wild, but when found, it is usually seen living in prairies, and Pokemon Snap has also shown it living in active volcanoes. In the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''On Cloud [NAME]'', it was shown that it stashes food in its mane and carries it to its nest for its young. As shown in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] is known to sleep at supremely comfortable sleeping spot. [NAME] when it sleeps is said to be similar to how an innocent child sleeps.

In some locations, such as China, [NAME] is seen as a Legendary Pokemon, where it's revered for its speed and power; it is also categorized as Legendary in An Illustrated Book of POCKET MONSTERS.",Fire,,Fire,,1.0,0,"[""Fire""]",642,9,651
Drizzile,817,Water Lizard,"[NAME] is a slim, lizard-like Pokemon. It is primarily blue with a white belly and a dark blue mark above it. It has lime green mitten-like hands and two-digit feet. On its face, it has small nostrils, half-lidded eyes with green eyelids, a thin line connecting its eyes, and a blue dot next to each eye. On its head are three hairlike structures, two dark blue and one purple. One of the structures sticks up like a cowlick. The other two droop over the face and cover one eye, resembling ""emo"" bangs. Inside its mouth, [NAME] has a long, mucus-coated tongue that can be used for catching prey or attacking opponents. Like its pre-evolved form, Sobble, it has a chameleon tail that swirls inward.

[NAME] uses special pores in its palms to secrete moisture, which it forms into water balloons that it uses to attack. [NAME] is highly intelligent, capable of devising strategies or using its surroundings to enact hit-and-run tactics. However, it is also exceptionally lazy and prefers to not do anything unless it has to. It makes its home inside tree hollows or rocks. It is very cautious, and lays out traps everywhere around its territory to keep enemies out. Like its evolutionary relatives, it also has the ability to camouflage itself when wet. [NAME] typically moves on all fours, although it can stand and walk on two legs. [NAME] will use its long, slimy tongue to first attack its prey with blinding speeds before finishing it off with great skill.

Komala,775,Drowsing,"[NAME] is a blue-gray Pokemon similar to a koala. It has large, rounded ears with light orange fur on the inside. Its large, ovoid black nose extends up between its fluffy white eyebrows, and there are additional white puffs of fur on each cheek. There is a small ruff of longer, gray fur around its neck. Each hand is black with five short fingers, and it has three black claws and a black paw pad on each foot. Its underbelly is white, as is its short, fluffy tail. [NAME] is usually seen holding a short wooden log, which it is given at birth. The log is typically a light brown with darker, oval markings all over it. The ends of the log are tan with the growth rings visible.

This Pokemon stays asleep from birth to death, staying this way because of its diet of certain leaves containing poison only [NAME] can break down, which induces sedative properties. While its expression sometimes changes as if it is aware of its surroundings, this appears to be a result of its dreams instead. It is able to eat, travel, and even battle without waking. If the log pillow it clings to is removed, it will be unable to sleep well and thrash wildly. However, it will sometimes cling to the arm of a Trainer it trusts. During a deep sleep, it stops moving altogether. According to ancient people, if a small amount of the saliva created when it eats leaves is watered down and ingested, one will be able to sleep well. This diluted saliva was also historically used as an anesthetic for surgeries. Hypno has been known to hunt this Pokemon in Alola, appearing to prefer them over humans.

The horn continuously grows through [NAME]'s lifetime. It has beady, black eyes and spherical hands with no digits. [NAME] is a male-only species with no female counterpart.

[NAME] is very adept at fighting with dance-like kicks. This technique has an amazing combination of both offense and defense at the same time.  [NAME] moves more quickly by spinning on the spike on its head than it does by walking normally. Capable of spinning at high speeds, it may bore into the ground similar to a drill. While spinning, [NAME] delivers smooth, graceful kicks. The centrifugal force of [NAME]'s spins boosts the destructive power of its attacks by a factor of 10. Anyone enchanted by its kicks will often get drilled hard by [NAME]'s kicks. [NAME] often competes with Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan. As an urban species, it is often found in towns and cities.

Prior to Generation VII and in Generation IX, [NAME] is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Triple Kick.

It has a jewel on its forehead and a black headpiece that seems to be shaped like a treble clef, which doubles as an attached microphone such as one often used by singers. Its ovular head seems to be a third of its body's height and about half its height in width. In its Aria Forme, [NAME] has light blue eyes and flowing, wavy hair with light-blue ovals that resemble whole notes. In its Pirouette Forme, it has auburn hair that seems to be stylized in a high bun and red eyes. In both forms, its midriff and eyes match its hair. It is a gender-unknown species.

According to artists in Unova, [NAME]'s beautiful music and dance inspired many works of art, music, and songs. This made the Pokemon popular among both musicians and dancers. [NAME]'s melody has a special vocalization method. [NAME]'s melody can control the feelings of those who hear it. It can make both humans and Pokemon feel happy or sad through this method. The song can also unseal ancient ruins such as the Abyssal Ruins. At one point, [NAME] can lose its signature melody and ability to dance should the world be filled with sorrow. Like many other Legendary and Mythical Pokemon, [NAME] is capable of flying and temporarily turning invisible. [NAME]'s song can be channeled to summon and control the original three forces of nature Pokemon in connection with the Reveal Glass. However, this process can cause [NAME] agonizing pain in the process.",Normal,Psychic,Normal,Psychic,1.0,1,"[""Normal"",""Psychic""]",640,332,972
Maushold,925,Family,"[NAME] is a group of three or four separate mouse-like rodent Pokemon which work together as one, similar to Exeggcute, Falinks, or its pre-evolved form Tandemaus. Each individual is small, white, and bipedal, and has a spherical head with large ears and stubby limbs that have large paws. Each one also has two black beady eyes, a tiny black nose with short whiskers, and a long tail which curls up and ends with a bulbous tip. When they open their mouths, which take up over half of their faces when fully open, a single upper incisor can be seen on the insides of each one.

Two of the individuals are larger, and their appearance is virtually unchanged from Tandemaus, where one has a light-gray patch of fur surrounding its chest which resembles a shirt, while the other has a light-gray patch of fur surrounding its legs, which resembles a pair of pants. The pair are accompanied by one or two smaller ones, which lack the light-gray patch of fur and have shorter tails and stubbier limbs. The smaller ones tend to hide behind the larger pair, and hold onto the tips of their tails when walking.

No one knows where the smaller individuals that form [NAME] come from. The larger and smaller individuals live together and act as a family; however, their actual relationship is unclear. The larger individuals protect the smaller ones in battle, although they will all work together when faced with strong opponents. [NAME] create and live in huge nests comprising many rooms with different purposes, such as eating and sleeping.

Lacking a distinct neck and head, its upper torso has almond-shaped eyes with black space around them and appears to lack a nose and mouth. Primarily brown, it has cream-colored, segmented arms and legs. Each hand has three fingers and each foot has three clawed toes. The soles of its feet and its ankles have circular, yellow pads. [NAME] is an exclusively male species with no female counterpart.

[NAME]'s legs freely contract and stretch similar to a coiled spring (and one particular [NAME] can do this with its arms as well). The source of its power comes from the ligaments in its legs that [NAME] can fully control. This flexibility allows [NAME] to run with lengthy strides, giving it greater reach for its kicks. Its excellent sense of balance enables it to kick in succession from any position. [NAME]'s kicking strength is incredibly powerful owing to its diamond-like soles. Right before kicking an opponent, [NAME] will harden the muscles on the sole of its foot, allowing it to maximize the full power of its kick. It has sometimes been nicknamed the ""Kick Master"". After battling, it rubs down its legs to relax the tight muscles. Rarely found in the wild, it is primarily found in urban areas. It has been seen competing with either Hitmonchan, or Hitmontop.

[NAME] has had several kicking moves as signature moves:
* High Jump Kick (Prior to Generation III)
* Jump Kick (Prior to Generation IV)
* Rolling Kick (Prior to Generation VII)
* Mega Kick (In Generation II, and from Generation IV to VI)

Garbodor,569,Trash Heap,"[NAME] is a Pokemon which has the appearance of a pile of trash spilling out of a large, torn garbage bag. It has a round, lumpy body that is mostly tan with blue and pink lumps. Its head has the appearance of the tied end of a garbage bag that has been ripped open and trails down like a cape. It has two appendages that look like clumps of garbage coming from its head. Its large, round eyes have small pupils, and when it opens its mouth, its large, triangular teeth can be seen. [NAME] has two long arms made of garbage; one held together with piping, with fingers also made up of piping material, and the other held together with rebar. It has one finger on its left hand and three on the other. It also has flat, dumpy feet.

[NAME] is able to spray poisonous gas and filth from its fingertips, but only from its right hand. The toxic liquid from its right arm is so virulent, it can kill a weakened foe instantly. If that filth is blocked, its arm can swell up, causing it considerable pain and discomfort. It can also finish off opponents by belting them with its left arm and spewing an awful-smelling toxic gas from its mouth. [NAME] prefers to live in unsanitary places such as garbage dumps, where it devours garbage in order to grow larger. Consuming garbage also allows [NAME] to create poisons in its body, the type of which depends on the kind of garbage eaten. Alola was once home to many [NAME], but the population shrank precipitously after Alolan Grimer and Muk, which prey on [NAME], were introduced to its habitat. This is said to have made the remaining [NAME] population stronger than its counterparts from other regions.",Poison,,Poison,,1.0,0,"[""Poison""]",636,74,710
Dondozo,977,Big Catfish,"[NAME] is a giant piscine Pokemon. Its body has three colors: light blue at the top; dark blue in the middle; and white on its belly, upper lip, and fins. It has a pair of pectoral fins and its rear half is flanked on either side by elongated anal fins, ending at a large, fan-like tail fin. On top of its head is a ring of six frills arranged in a circle: the two rightmost frills are much longer and end in flat tips, resembling a hachimaki, while the other four are shorter and rounded. It has three gills on either side of its body. Its face has a short protrusion resembling a nose, along with dark blue lips, a blue tongue, a pair of long barbels above its upper lip, and five barbels on its lower jaw, with one of them being longer and curled, located just below its lower lip. [NAME]'s tongue is long and rectangular with two blocky protrusions below it, altogether resembling a ''sushi geta'' (wooden serving tray for sushi).

[NAME] is one of the biggest Pokemon ever discovered, and is a heavy eater. Although powerful, [NAME] is dull and not very good at hunting, so it teams up with Tatsugiri to catch prey. The Tatsugiri baits their prey by playing dead and then commands [NAME] to attack. [NAME] is loyal to Tatsugiri and acts as its subordinate, protecting it inside its mouth from enemies. Basculin is among the species [NAME] preys upon.

A giant [NAME], alongside a giant Tatsugiri, are both known as the False Dragon Titan, two of the Titan Pokemon found in Paldea. It mainly resides in the Casseroya Lake where it feeds on Spicy Herba Mystica in a hidden cave.

The armor on its head has two pairs of holes with horns protruding from the foremost holes. Its forehead plating extends past its upper jaw in a small point. It has sky-blue eyes, and two nostril-like holes on the tip of its upper jaw. On the rim of its mouth are several pointed, fang-like protrusions and the nape of its neck and back have gray-silver armor sections. It has wide, blunt spikes on its shoulders and gray-silver bands on its arms and legs. Its hands and feet each have three claws. It has a thick, long, black tail that it can swing at enemies.

The gouges in [NAME]'s armor from previous battles are worn as mementos. The more wounds it has, the more it has battled. It claims a large mountain as its territory and fiercely defends it from trespassers. If its environment is damaged by a flood or a forest fire, it will restore the area by bringing in topsoil and planting trees. It burrows through the strongest of bedrock and digs tunnels, as it searches for iron to eat. Its horns, which it uses to dig through bedrock when seeking food, grow a little longer at a time and can be used to determine its age. [NAME]'s horn is sharp enough to cut through steel and used as a ramming weapon to bring foes down. Long ago, there was a king who wore a helmet resembling an [NAME] in an attempt to channel its strength. As mentioned in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] has been observed eating iron ore on rare occasions while it sleeps. It is believed that [NAME] engages in this behavior due to exhaustion after patrolling its territory.",Steel,Rock,Ground,Rock,0.5,0,"[""Ground"", ""Rock""]",643,140,783

Around its neck is a golden, half-circlet with a pink diamond in the center. Its head is gray with purple eyes that have red sclerae and pointed ears. On top of its head is a collection of pink crystals forming a headdress. There are four spike-like crystals along the top, a long crystal on either side hanging downward, and a large circular centerpiece on its forehead. There is a small golden piece hanging off the center crystal and a small pink diamond embedded in the back of its head.

[NAME] is born from a Carbink that undergoes a mysterious mutation. It can instantly create diamonds by compressing the carbon in the air. [NAME] uses these diamonds to attack and to defend itself, usually whipping up a storm of diamonds. [NAME] is also said to be one of the most beautiful Pokemon seen in the world, and its pink, glimmering body has been called one of the loveliest sights possible. [NAME] is found living in underground caves filled with diamonds such as the Diamond Domain, a crystal kingdom where it reigns as queen over many Carbink, as it has occasionally been seen traveling or living with others. While Carbink tend to gather around [NAME], it pays little attention to them. [NAME] can speak through telepathy, as depicted in the movie ''[NAME] and the Cocoon of Destruction''.

Black markings surround its circular eyes, and it has a light yellow beak and feet. There is a single blue spot on its stomach. Its feet have two digits each. A metallic ring is visible around its neck (which hides a wire that allows it to extend its head over long distances), and its ""bag"" is attached to its body by a black and blue cable. When running, it uses its feet as if it was skiing.
There are only two reported sightings of [NAME]. According to an article from an October issue of Occulture magazine, [NAME] was described in the Violet Book as a being that resembled Delibird possessing a spherical apparatus from which it would fire huge blasts of ice to propel itself through snowy lands. An unproven theory suggests it is the product of a long-gone civilization, as supported by ancient writings that describe the design and usage of machines resembling [NAME]. When it falls asleep, it turns itself off, causing the blue energy on the spot of its belly and in [NAME]'s ""bag"" to turn black.

According to AI Turo, [NAME] is a future Pokemon related to Delibird. However, according to a version of Professor Turo that appeared at the Crystal Pool, [NAME] is a counterpart of Delibird from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. [NAME] were brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Turo ten years ago. 200 years ago, Heath also encountered [NAME], as seen in the Violet Book, though it is unclear how it arrived there at the time.",Ice,Water,Ice,Steel,0.5,0,"[""Ice"", ""Steel""]",624,140,764
Persian,53,Classy Cat,"[NAME] is a large, quadrupedal, feline Pokemon. Its fur is pale tan with the exception of its black-rimmed ears. It has a short muzzle with a small, black nose, red eyes with slit pupils, rounded ears, a pair of pointed teeth in its upper jaw, and three whiskers on either side of its face. Its thick whiskers are very sensitive to changes in air movements, enabling it to detect its prey by movement alone. In the center of its forehead is a red jewel. Its long tail has a distinctive curl at the end. [NAME] communicates with body language and holds its tail upright to signal its intention to pounce. It has long legs and three-toed paws with retractable claws. [NAME]'s lithe muscles also enable it to walk without making a sound.

[NAME] normally lives in towns and cities. Although popular for its elegance, it is extremely difficult to raise as a pet due to its fickle and temperamental personality. It will scratch anyone, including its Trainer, with little or no provocation, and has been observed ripping its prey apart for no discernible reason. However, when [NAME] is yanked by its whiskers, it becomes temporarily docile for unknown reasons. It is popular among rich people and is targeted by hunters for its jewel. Its relationship with Perrserker is one of mutual disdain, as [NAME]'s refined and elegant personality clashes with Perrserker's barbaric nature. As mentioned in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] is known to clean and groom itself even when asleep. Even when asleep, [NAME] maintains its striking and haughty expression.

Gabite,444,Cave,"[NAME] is a medium-sized, bipedal, dragon-like Pokemon that is primarily blue. Its underside is light blue, with red covering it from the middle of its abdomen to the bottoms of its jaw. [NAME] has two appendages that resemble jets or plane engines extending out the side of its skull. Each appendage has a blue stripe. It has four fins: one on each arm, one on its back, and another on its tail. The back fin has a notch on it for the male. It has spikes on its hind limbs, and sharp claws on its feet and wrists. Its eyes have black sclerae and gold colored irises.

[NAME] is a fierce and predatory Pokemon known for its scales, which are believed to have medicinal properties and the ability to heal most illnesses, even those thought to be incurable. [NAME] has short, extremely sharp teeth, like its pre-evolved form Gible, and is known to actively dig in order to expand its nest. The protrusions on [NAME]'s head allows it to emit ultrasound waves, which can be used for navigating through pitch-dark caves. [NAME] is also a very territorial creature and will fight back against enemies to protect its home. [NAME] is passionate about shiny objects, such as gems, treasures, and even Carbink, and it hoards a collection of them in its nest. When it sees Sableye trying to take Carbink as food, [NAME] jealously attacks the Sableye. Despite its aggressive demeanor, giving [NAME] a sparkly item such as a glass bead can turn it docile. It predominantly lives in mountainous regions, and can survive in both snowy and arid temperatures.

Togedemaru,777,Roly-Poly,"[NAME] is a spherical, rodent-like Pokemon. Most of its front is white, while its back is primarily gray. It has black eyes, a short pointed snout with a black nose, rounded ears, and a circular, yellow marking on each cheek. Scattered across its back are 14 fur spikes that appear as yellow and brown triangular markings. When attacking, surprised, or agitated, these spikes will stand straight up. There is a tail-like needle on the back of its head. The needle is gray with a yellow tip and is shaped like a lightning bolt. Additionally, it has stubby arms and legs. When [NAME]'s spines are out, its cheek marks sometimes look like electrical outlets.

[NAME] uses the needle on top of its head to attract and gather electricity. Groups can be seen gathered with their needles standing upright, waiting to be struck by lightning on stormy days to make up for its somewhat limited electric capacity. Some Trainers use its ability to absorb electricity as a strategy in battle. The opponent is coaxed into unleashing an Electric attack, and then has that power turned against it. When it is pleased, this Pokemon will curl into a ball and roll around uncontrollably. [NAME] clashes with Elekid whenever it tries to steal the latter's electricity, usually ending with even matches. 

A special [NAME] in Alola acts as the Totem Pokemon for Sophocles's trial in Hokulani Observatory. This [NAME] possesses Z-Power, an energy that originates from Ultra Wormholes and takes the form of a golden, flaring aura. The reward for defeating Totem [NAME] and completing the trial is an Electrium Z.

Greninja,658,Ninja,"[NAME] is a bipedal, frog-like Pokemon. It is mostly dark blue with a yellow chest and abdomen, a white triangular marking over each eye, a light blue four-pointed star on each thigh, and yellow on the lower half of its face. It has red eyes with white pupils and its mouth is hidden behind a large, pink tongue that wraps around its neck and extends outward behind its head. Running down the middle of its head is a fin-like extension, and there is a similar fin on each side of its head. Light blue webbing connects its head fins. There is a large, white bubble-like bump on each elbow and knee. Its back feet have two toes, while its front feet have three toes. Each digit has a bulbous tip and yellow webbing.

[NAME]'s movements are swift, rapid, and graceful, akin to those of ninja. It uses this speed to confound enemies while slicing them up. It can compress water into various weapons to slice up enemies, most commonly in the form of water shurikens, though it has been shown creating water katana and water kunai in both the animated series and the Super Smash Bros. video game series. It can also create shuriken from the mucus it excretes from its thighs for sharp projectiles that can split through metal. As seen in the animated series, [NAME]'s tongue is extremely long and many times its own height, and strong enough to catch and hold an average human. However, it usually keeps its tongue wrapped around its neck like a scarf. Doing so exposes its tongue to air movements, allowing [NAME] to detect enemies it otherwise could not see.

In Generation VI, Mat Block was its signature move. In Generation IX, Water Shuriken is its signature move.

Krokorok,552,Desert Croc,"[NAME] is a reptilian Pokemon with a mostly tan body, pink stomach, black back, and long tail. It is classified as a quadruped, though it is more often seen on two legs. It has six thick, black stripes on its body: one at shoulder level, one around its midsection, one around its hips, and three on its tail. Each stripe is topped with a triangular spike on its back.

Two of its front and rear teeth are visible overlapping its lower jaw. A black stripe sits on the bridge of the snout just behind its large nostrils.

[NAME] prefers to live in the desert, usually in small groups. The black membrane surrounding its eyes protects them from sandstorms and acts as a thermal detector. This allows [NAME] to see the temperature of different objects, which also gives it exceptional night vision. This enables it to hunt in the dead of night without getting lost. However, it never moves much during the night. A group of [NAME] usually consists of a few individuals. The group is led by a female [NAME] while the males gather food. [NAME] dislikes feeling cold, so it burrows into the desert sand at night. It tends to bury its prey in the sand to preserve them in the event of an unsuccessful hunt.",Ground,Dark,Ground,Dark,1.0,1,"[""Ground"", ""Dark""]",636,76,712
Onix,95,Rock Snake,"[NAME] is a Pokemon composed of a giant chain of gray boulders that become smaller towards the tail. Its length makes it the tallest Rock Pokemon. It has black eyes and a rounded snout. On top of its head is a rocky spine. As it grows older, it becomes more rounded and smoother, eventually becoming similar to black diamonds. Inside its brain is a magnet that serves as an internal compass, guiding [NAME] wherever they need to go and prevents them from getting lost while digging.

[NAME] tunnels under the ground at over 50 miles (80 kilometers) per hour, which causes tremors and a terrifying roar that echoes a long way. Hard objects encountered while tunneling are absorbed into its body, which makes it very sturdy. It also consumes the boulders for food. The massive, winding tunnels it leaves behind are used as homes by Diglett. As seen in the Pokemon Stadium series, [NAME] is capable of rotating its head, or any part of its body, in a full 360 degrees. It is a very aggressive Pokemon that will constantly attack humans and other Pokemon when in pain, as seen in the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''To Master the [NAME]pected!''. As seen in the Pokemon Adventures manga, [NAME] can be separated from its body segments in battle and be fine later on, either regenerating or reattaching to its body segments. It is said that an [NAME] that lives for about 100 years will evolve into a Steelix after its composition becomes more diamond-like. It can be found in mountains and caves. As mentioned in Sleep, [NAME] is known on occasion to sleep while in the middle of digging through tunnels.

Each of its hands has five fingers, while each of its feet has three toes. It has two large white eyes with black irises. A lime green mask pattern frames its eyes, and extends towards its forehead in a small bump above its snout.

[NAME] has two, leaf-shaped hair tufts that hold a stick on the top of its head. The stick used to be a branch from a forest where troops of [NAME] lived, and it has a special power due to being exposed to the energy within [NAME]'s body. This energy helps [NAME]'s stick grow harder and more flexible. Besides using it when attacking, [NAME] beats this stick rhythmically against the surfaces of all sorts of objects. This has been observed to cause grass to grow, and wilted flowers and leaves to seemingly regain their color. It enjoys being in high places, and rhythmic things such as music or dancing. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy.

Clauncher,692,Water Gun,"[NAME] is a crustacean Pokemon that resembles a bright blue shrimp. It has three pairs of light gray legs; two pairs have simple blue spikes, while the foremost pair forms a larger set of claws. The left claw forms a single, sharp point; while the right claw is much larger and forms a more traditional pincer, with a tiny yellow lower claw and a yellow circular pattern with two stripes on the back. Each front claw has a black stripe across the top. It has a pair of yellow antennae on top of its head, yellow eyes, and three pointed mandibles. There are three black stripes along its back that separate its body into segments, and it has a light gray underside. Two black, rectangular fins form its tail.

[NAME]'s large right claw gives it a poor sense of balance and makes it difficult to swim straight. Instead, it moves by firing compressed water from this claw. This is achieved through controlled expulsions of internal gas. Additionally, it uses this ability to shoot down flying prey and can shatter rock at close range. It is an adept user of aura-based attacks.

Occasionally, [NAME]'s claws will fall off, causing it to go into hiding until the claws grow back. The meat inside its claws is said to be delicious; however, it has a characteristic taste that is not universally loved. [NAME]'s claws are a popular delicacy in places like Galar and Paldea.  Dreepy is known to bite on [NAME], although it does not actually feed on them; this is said to be a behavior carried over from when the Dreepy was alive.

It has slender legs with small, three-toed paws and a fluffy, slightly curved tail.

[NAME]'s ribbon-like feelers emit a soothing aura that erases any sense of hostility, enabling it to stop fights instantly. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, [NAME]'s soothing aura can allow any nearby Trainers to obtain a good night sleep whenever they go to sleep. When hunting, it swirls its feelers as a distraction while the aura weakens feelings of hostility in its prey, then it pounces on the victim. It will also wrap its feelers around its Trainer's arm as they walk together, which allows it to read their feelings. When a fight breaks out between [NAME] and Dragon Pokemon, [NAME] will bravely charge at them even if they are much bigger than itself; in Galar, this feat is told as a fairy tale.

This Pokemon can create a very powerful magnetic field through the strong electric currents emitted from its paw pads. Using this magnetic field allows it to levitate and move at high speeds while airborne. [NAME] can travel as fast as a lightning strike. Its fur is known to stand on end whenever it is using massive amounts of electricity. [NAME] can tear its opponents apart with its high-voltage claws. Even if the opponent dodges, they can still get electrocuted by the flying sparks. Lightning flashes and thunderclaps can occur when [NAME] starts running.

[NAME]'s shoulders and thighs are yellow, and its red feet have two, clawed toes each. It has black, metal shackles around its neck and ankles. Down its back is a row of red spikes, and there is a flame at the tip of its tapering, yellow tail.

[NAME]'s body temperature is nearly 2,200° Fahrenheit (1,200° Celsius), giving its body an orange glow. Because it hates cold places, this Pokemon typically resides in and around active volcanoes where it is born from. This Pokemon has even been known to spit scorching flames to establish an ideally warm environment for itself. The [NAME] found in Alola are said to be sturdier than [NAME] found elsewhere.

In battle, [NAME] blows out intense flames from all over its body to intimidate its foes and incinerate its surroundings. The ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''Riddle Me This'' has shown that extremely well-trained [NAME] can block Electric attacks with super-heated air.

Sandy Shocks,989,Paradox,"[NAME] is a seemingly metallic Pokemon with a body composed of three units that resemble ancient versions of Magnemite, all of which have yellow eyes. Unlike Magneton,  each eye blinks independently of one another and not in unison. The top unit bears markings similar to tribal war paint as well as iron filings on its body and horseshoe magnets that resemble hair. The bottom units have only a single magnet each, which is elongated in a manner that makes them resemble legs; they are also covered with iron filings on their ends. Instead of floating like Magneton, it walks by bending these magnets. A series of screws with iron filings on the end floats between the two lower units, making it resemble a tail. 

According to an article from a July issue of Occulture magazine, some scientists claim that [NAME] is a Magneton that has lived for 10,000 years. It has allegedly been sighted numerous times in Paldea's more arid regions, but there are no reports of it ever having been caught. It is said to have an aggressive disposition and some people who have seen it claim to have been attacked. [NAME] purportedly takes its name from a beast with a matching description in the Scarlet Book.

According to AI Sada, [NAME] is an ancient Pokemon related to Magneton. However, according to a version of Professor Sada that appeared at the Crystal Pool, [NAME] is a counterpart of Magneton from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. [NAME] was brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Sada ten years ago. 200 years ago, Heath also encountered [NAME], as seen in the Scarlet Book, though it is unclear how it arrived there at the time.",Electric,Ground,Electric,Steel,0.5,0,"[""Electric"", ""Steel""]",625,140,765
Kubfu,891,Wushu,"[NAME] is a small, bearlike Pokemon. Its body is primarily dark gray, with a yellow snout and white patches of fur on its head and chest.

[NAME] builds up power and fighting spirit by pulling on these ribbons. Its nose is black and it has a perpetual frown. It has black claws and toes, the latter of which are shaped like triangles. Its tail has a black, spiky appearance.

[NAME] works hard to train both body and mind, even using its defeats as a motivation to grow even stronger. It has a unique organ that allows it to create ""fighting energy"" in its lower abdomen through special breathing techniques and intense focusing. Wild [NAME] live in mountainous areas far away from the Galar region, although they lived in the region at some point. According to historical texts, [NAME] used to travel to uncharted lands with people as they went to trade or explore. Records suggest that the [NAME] living in faraway mountains in the present day, may have descended from the [NAME] that became naturalized in the distant lands they visited in the past. It has been referred to as the ""'''secret armor'''"" of the Isle of Armor's Master Dojo, being gifted by Mustard to the one who pass the dojo's three trials. The move it masters by reading one of the special scrolls in one of the Towers of Two Fists will determine which fighting style it takes after evolving. While it can be timid, it can become more brave and confident once trained up.

Its face has blue eyes, a pointed yellow beak, and a teal brow just above it which flares into two large branches flanking a small bump in the middle. On top of [NAME]'s head is a round blue crest twice as large, which droops towards the back. Various blue and teal-colored feathers also adorn its chest, forearms, tail, and the insides of its feet. The three feathers at the end of its arms are similar to fingers. [NAME]'s legs are long and its feet are yellow with three toes each, and they wrap around its ankles in a manner that resembles ballet shoes.

The crest above [NAME]'s head is capable of absorbing impacts, and is used by [NAME] to shield itself from incoming attacks. Doing this may mess up the crest, however, which causes its body and mind to feel unwell and weakened. If its crest becomes unkempt and messy, it will quickly use gel to comb it back into shape.

[NAME] has a serious, stoic personality, though it is also known to be temperamental. It learns and practices dance routines by observing the movements of people and Pokemon from various regions. [NAME] is a hard worker, and constantly trains its strength and technique. Flocks of [NAME] train by running their legs through shallow waters, and then compete with each other for the most graceful kicks. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, [NAME] maintains its beautiful posture. However, the daily training it maintains can occasionally leave it too tired to care for its coif. As a result, the coif is usually left messy as it sleeps.",Water,,Water,Flying,0.5,0,"[""Water"",""Flying""]",611,139,750

It has a crystal-like formation on each shoulder, and there are large bangles on its wrists and ankles. It has a Roman armor-like ""skirt"" and flat feet beneath. There is an unproven theory that [NAME] contains a perpetual motion machine that creates a limitless amount of energy.

Despite its large size, [NAME] is capable of flying by retracting its hands into its arms and its legs and feet into its body, then taking off like a rocket at Mach speeds. It is also capable of forming a cannon by pulling its legs into its body and standing on its hands, as seen in PokePark 2: Wonders Beyond, the animated series, and the Pokemon Adventures manga. If the seal on its chest is removed, its energy runs wild, and its energy's color turns from yellow to red. This causes it to rage and fly around uncontrollably without being able to land itself. Removing the seal also causes [NAME] to attack indiscriminately. A rampaging [NAME] can turn a whole town into a mountain of rubble.

[NAME] is said to have been invented by ancient people to serve as a laborer and protector of people and Pokemon, and is sometimes used in construction projects. It also served as sentries on artillery platforms built into the walls of ancient castles, where it could fire energy beams. [NAME] will faithfully follow its master's orders without question.

Each syrpent has green, leaf-shaped eyestalks with yellow eyes; a long green body with a pale yellow underbelly; and a tail tipped with leafy green ornaments.

Three of the seven syrpents are always visible outside of the syrup apple: the central syrpent, which is the dominant entity in the system, rises from the center of the apple; and two of the syrpents' tails emerge from its rear. The central syrpent has the longest body and is further distinguished by its two horns. The left horn has an apple impaled on it, which appears to be the same apple that the Pokemon inhabited when it was an Applin. The four other syrpents composing [NAME] are usually hidden within the syrup, with only the tops of their closed eyestalks visible from without. Sometimes, the four hidden syrpents emerge from the syrup so that five of [NAME]'s heads are visible. To move, [NAME]'s two tail syrpents work together to push its entire body across the ground.

The seven syrpents that form [NAME] have inconstant and fickle temperaments, and rarely work together as a team. On the rare occasion that the syrpents' moods align, [NAME] unleashes its full power.

It is a poor swimmer, and is often seen aimlessly floating in the ocean with just its ice-covered head floating on the surface, occasionally washing up on distant shores. It never panics or gets upset whenever it ends up in a new land, instead continuing due to its ability to adapt. The ice on [NAME]'s head has a mild salty taste, presumed to be caused by it having floated in the oceans. When the weather is hot, groups of [NAME] will cool each other down by pressing their ice cube heads together. [NAME]'s hair is connected to the surface of its brain, which then chills the air around it when it has something on its mind. [NAME] also uses its hair to catch prey in the sea, by forming ice balls at the tip and dipping it into the water like a fishing line.

[NAME]'s flames are said to provide a replacement for the sun when the atmosphere is dark with volcanic ash, and some legends claim that it hatched from a cocoon of raging flames to save people and Pokemon in freezing climates. It was feared as the ''rage of the sun'' by ancient people, and it was even worshiped as a ''deity of fire'' in some places, they even referred to it as the ''embodiment of the sun''. [NAME]'s shrine in Relic Castle remains as a testament to the respect it commanded. Despite being worshiped in cold regions, it is unpopular in hot regions due to its burning body. [NAME] is also considered dangerous due to how it scatters hot burning scales, which can rob the surrounding air of its oxygen.

Slither Wing and Iron Moth bear a resemblance to [NAME]. Slither Wing is believed to be a revived ancestor of [NAME]. Iron Moth is believed to be [NAME]'s descendant, possibly a UFO being controlled by alien life for observation. However, according to a Professor SadaS/TuroV brought to the Crystal Pool by Terapagos, both Pokemon are counterparts of [NAME] from parallel timelines.

Toxapex,748,Brutal Star,"[NAME] is an echinoderm  Pokemon with twelve large, starfish-like legs sprouting from the top of its small head. It has bright blue eyes with yellow sclerae and pupils. The main part of its body, consisting of a small head with protrusions similar to starfish arms below it, is a purplish pink. Its head is dark blue on top, near where its legs connect. This part of its body is typically suspended in the air due to the length of its legs.

The legs themselves are light blue on top and dark blue on the undersides. The legs are filled with spines, which can protrude towards the outer leg or retract into the inner leg. The inner spines are purplish pink, and when they are present, the outer spines sink back into its legs, and vice versa. The tip of each leg has two orange claws, and there is a ring of orange spines around a purplish-pink marking where all the legs meet on top.

[NAME] uses its legs to walk along the ocean floor, where it hunts for Corsola. They can also be used to create a dome-like shelter, protecting it from the tides and, in colder regions, trapping its body heat to keep it warm. [NAME]'s spines sense the flow of tides, allowing it to survey its surroundings. Its spines can also be fired at enemies and carry a powerful poison, which causes pain for 72 hours (3 days), even to Pokemon as large as Wailord. Aftereffects of the venom remain even after recovery. If a foe bypasses its spines, it attacks with its claws instead. Bruxish is its natural enemy. [NAME] competes against it in warm ocean currents, despite the odds being against it.

[NAME] is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Baneful Bunker. It and its pre-Evolution, Mareanie, are also the only known Pokemon that can have Merciless as an Ability.",Poison,Water,Poison,Water,1.0,1,"[""Poison"", ""Water""]",678,77,755
Squirtle,7,{{tt|Tiny Turtle|TinyTurtle prior to Generation III}},"[NAME] is a small reptilian Pokemon that resembles a light-blue turtle. While it typically walks on its two short legs, it has been shown to run on all fours in Super Smash Bros. Brawl. It has large, purplish, or reddish eyes and a slightly hooked upper lip. Each of its hands and feet has three pointed digits. The end of its long, squirrel-like tail curls inward. Its body is encased by a tough shell that forms and hardens after birth. This shell is brown on the top, pale yellow on the bottom, and has a thick white ridge between the two halves.

[NAME]'s shell is a useful tool. It can withdraw into its shell for protection or to sleep. The grooved, rounded shape helps to reduce water resistance, allowing the Pokemon to swim at high speeds. [NAME] can spray foamy water from its mouth with great accuracy. [NAME] is scarce in the wild, although it can be found around small ponds and lakes. [NAME] can also be found residing around rivers in mountainous regions, as shown in Snap and Scarlet and Violet. In the OS episode ''Beach Blank-Out Blastoise'', [NAME] is shown to be found living on secluded islands with other members of their evolutionary line. Sharpedo is a natural predator of [NAME]. As shown in Sleep, [NAME] is known to sleep by withdrawing its limbs and head into its shell.  It does this to protect itself from threats while sleeping. It also occasionally rocks contentedly from side to side while sleeping. [NAME] has four different sleep styles: ''Sheltered Sleep'', ''Unsheltered Sleep'', ''Overturned Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''.

In Generation II, [NAME] and its evolved forms were the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Skull Bash naturally, but other Pokemon could still inherit it via breeding.",Water,,Water,,1.0,0,"[""Water""]",651,9,660
Sinistcha,1013,Matcha,"[NAME] is a Pokemon made of matcha tea. As such, its main body is entirely green, except for its mouth and swirly eyes, which are yellow in color. Its arms are thin and its hands have three digits, and it has two small legs. It inhabits a 茶碗 ''chawan'', a tea bowl used in the traditional Japanese tea ceremony. The ''chawan'' it inhabits is black and white, with a few cracks sealed with green all over it, and a swirling, face-like pattern on its side. Atop its head, [NAME] wears a 茶筅 ''chasen'' (a bamboo whisk used to prepare and stir matcha tea), which is broken and missing a few of its teeth. Despite appearances, [NAME] is not biologically related to Polteageist.

[NAME] lives in cool, dark areas such as the back of a shelf or beneath a house's floorboards. In the past, [NAME] would sneak into houses and pretend to be tea in order to trick people into drinking it, so it can absorb their life force. However, because the ''chawan'' [NAME] inhabits had fallen out of use, this act became largely unsuccessful. In recent times, instead of sneaking into houses, [NAME] roams towns and suburbs in search of prey. It is generally active after sunset, and will attack anything that approaches it with a life-force-draining splash of tea. In order to prepare itself for battle, [NAME] builds up its energy by using the ''chasen'' on its head to stir itself.

[NAME] is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Matcha Gotcha. Additionally, [NAME] and its pre-evolved form, Poltchageist, are the only known Pokemon that can have Hospitality as an Ability.",Grass,Ghost,Ghost,Grass,0.5,0,"[""Ghost"", ""Grass""]",647,204,851

[NAME]'s spirit can leave its body without dying and can return to the body at will. It sleeps at the bottom of a lake to preserve the balance of the world. It can control an individual's will or enter the body of an individual. Legends say that if [NAME] is harmed, it can cause humans to lose all will inside of them, making them completely immobile for all eternity. [NAME] is highly feared due it having the power to manipulate the will of foes into its own puppets. It was shown in ''The Needs of the Three!'' and ''The Battle Finale of Legend!'' that it can teleport itself, as well as other Pokemon and humans. [NAME] can be very cautious around people and Pokemon. However, if threatened, it will reveal its bold side. In the past, it has been referred to as the ""Being of Willpower"" due to its role in giving humans the determination to face challenges in life. Alongside the other lake guardians, [NAME] is needed for the creation of a Red Chain, either through gems extracted from its body or through its fang. Together they're also capable of destroying a Red Chain. They even have the power to calm down Dialga and Palkia should the deities be enraged, but not both at once. [NAME] lives in Lake Valor, specifically in the Valor Cavern at the center of the lake, thus gaining the title Lake Guardian. In Legends: Arceus, [NAME] is shown to be capable of speaking the human language via telepathy.

It has one pair of barbel and a small white fin on each side of its face. The barbels are white on a female and blue on a male. It has small, red eyes, a three-pointed, dark blue crest on its head, and four white, spiky dorsal fins. [NAME]'s tail fin is similar in structure to the crest on its head, except with a thin, white fin spread between the points.

The process of Evolution causes a change in its brain structure that is believed to cause its violent nature. [NAME]'s fangs can crush stones and its scales are harder than steel. [NAME] is feared for its fierce temper and wanton destructive tendencies since ancient times. In some regions, [NAME] is called the ""deity of destruction"" because of this. It appears in times of conflict and destroys the surrounding area. Its rampages have been known to last a month at a time. These rampages can occur even during a harsh storm. A [NAME]'s rage won't stop completely until everything is destroyed. Some believed any human settlement is fated to be destroyed should a [NAME] appear. [NAME] lives in both fresh and salty waters. Both [NAME] and its Mega form have demonstrated in Pokemon Chronicles and ''Pokemon the Series'' that it can leap huge distances both from the water and from the ground, usually several times its own body length. However, [NAME] is rarely seen in the wild. The move Hyper Beam is often associated with [NAME] due to it being being powerful enough to instantly destroy everything it hits.",Water,Flying,Water,Flying,1.0,1,"[""Water"", ""Flying""]",653,76,729
Honchkrow,430,Big Boss,"[NAME] is a dark-blue avian Pokemon with plumage resembling a person dressed in formal attire, one that most resembles a mob boss.

Its wings have red feathers on the inside. [NAME] has black feet with four toes. The tail's base is a white, cylindrical stalk, on which there is a growth of red feathers on the end.

[NAME] is known to be ruthless. With a mere cry, it can summon and organize a murder of more than one hundred Murkrow to collect food for it. [NAME] also summons Murkrow to fight on its behalf, letting them do most of the fighting before it deals the finishing blow. The flocks of summoned Murkrow often plunge the sky into pitch-black darkness, giving [NAME] the moniker, ""Summoner of Night."" [NAME] will never forgive any failure or betrayal of the Murkrow that follow it, and it will hunt and punish any member of its flock that does so. [NAME] is more active at night, and normally spends the daytime hours tending to its feathers in solitude. It is a scavenger that lives in swamps, forests, human towns and cities, and plains. As mentioned in Sleep Style Dex, [NAME] has been occasionally seen sleeping while guarding large number of jewels. It is theorized that the jewels it holds were gathered by its Murkrow followers. [NAME] has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: ''Preening Sleep'', ''Roosting Sleep'', ''Gem-Guarding Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''.",Dark,Flying,Dark,Flying,1.0,1,"[""Dark"", ""Flying""]",667,12,679
Goodra,706,{{tt|Dragon|Goodra}},"[NAME] is a bipedal, draconic Pokemon that is coated with slime. Most of its body is pale purple with a darker purple underside. It has bright green eyes, two green spots on each cheek, a relatively long neck, and a short, rounded snout. On top of its head are two pairs of antenna-like horns. The foremost horns are small nubs, but the hind horns are longer, thicker, and curve down its neck. The tips of the larger horns are slightly curled. It has proportionally short limbs with two digits each and a large, thick tail with a curled tip. Along each side of its tail are three green spots. A pale green slime is usually visible dripping from its chin and arms. It is known for having a great affinity for water, being able to live within water with no difficulty at all, as well as dive and surf all around the area.

Because of its meek, friendly nature, [NAME] is often teased for supposed weakness. [NAME] is known to be very friendly. When it grows close to someone, it will hug them and leave them coated in slime. If it is left alone, it will ooze gooey tears. [NAME] usually misunderstands instructions, appearing dazed or bewildered. Despite this, many Trainers don't mind it, instead finding this behavior to be adorable. However, it will strike at its tormentors with its retractable horns and powerful tail. [NAME] can become uncontrollable once enraged. The horns can hit 100 times harder than the blow of a heavyweight boxer. It is also capable of throwing punches with incredible force. Its slimy coating in combination with a layer of fat causes attacks to slide off. [NAME] lives in plains and mountains, usually during rainy days.

Prior to Generation IX, [NAME] and its pre-evolved forms were the only known Pokemon that could have Gooey as an Ability.",Dragon,,Dragon,,1.0,0,"[""Dragon""]",657,73,730
Dudunsparce,982,Land Snake,"[NAME] is a serpentine Pokemon that looks nearly identical to its pre-Evolution, Dunsparce. It has the same yellow body with a blue underside and blue and cream stripes on its back. It sports three ""prongs"" on its blue chin and its eyes are now partially opened up, revealing its two pupiless white colored scleras. It has a dark blue spiral pattern on the underside of its first body segment, and its tail has a blue ""cap"" on it.

The most notable change [NAME] has compared to its pre-Evolution is that its body is longer, having gained segments that are similar to Dunsparce's original body. Two known variations are known to exist: Two-Segment Form and Three-Segment Form [NAME]. According to a study, [NAME]'s number of segments is determined by its genes. Each segment has its own pair of wings and back pattern. Two-Segment Form [NAME] have two body segments, with two blue stripes and a pair of two-feathered wings on the first body segment, and one blue stripe and a pair of one-feathered wings on the second. Some [NAME] have the Three-Segment Form instead, which has an additional body segment after the head; this segment has three blue stripes and a pair of three-feathered wings.

[NAME] makes its nest, which can reach over six miles (10&nbsp;km) long, by using its hard tail to bore holes into bedrock deep underground. It drives enemies out of its nest by inhaling air with its long, narrow lungs — enough to greatly inflate its first body segment — and then releasing it in an intense blast. However, it is also known to be gentle, and will carry Pokemon wandering into its nest on its back and guide them outside.

Glimmora,970,Ore,"[NAME] is a coned flower-like Pokemon. It has three light green crystalline petals as a tail. The tail is connected to four light purple crystalline petals with light green lines each. The head is black with yellow eyes and a transparent black cone. The six-head crystalline petals are colored dark blue with light green lines and four light green rectangle shapes at the end of each petal.

[NAME] can move by floating and by closing its petals. It can latch onto walls to disguise itself as a plant and suck out energy and nutrients out of it. Should [NAME] sense danger, it will open all its petals to unleash a beam attack in retaliation. Even though [NAME]'s petals appear like flower petals, they are actually composed from crystallized poison energy. It has been observed that [NAME]'s petals resemble the Tera Jewels that are seen when a Pokemon Terastallizes. [NAME], along with its pre-evolved form, Glimmet, tend to be found in Area Zero and the Area Zero Underdepths, the source of the Terastal phenomenon, and eight Glimmet Crystals are needed to make the TM for Tera Blast, a move that changes type with Terastallizing. It is currently unconfirmed whether there is an actual connection between Terastallization and [NAME], however. Outside of Area Zero, [NAME] primarily lives in caves. [NAME] has also been seen in Kitakami, specifically the Crystal Pool, where there are Terastal crystals at the bottom of the lake. [NAME]'s diet consists of consuming both energy and nutrients from the walls of deep caves along with Terastal energy.

It has two large red eyes that are capable of glowing, and a small white part that could be either its mouth or a vent. It has thin arms with overlapping segments. Each arm ends with a single, pointed claw from which it can spin a sticky string to create structures. There is a gray circle on each shoulder and a gray band around its abdomen. Its segmented legs each end with a large, upward-curving claw.
[NAME] was revived from a Fossil and technologically enhanced by Team Plasma to create the most powerful Pokemon ever. N had the project canceled and the P2 Laboratory closed because he felt that Pokemon, who he thought to be perfect beings, would lose their beauty if modified by science. However, Scientist Dudley kept working on it, angry that N denied his talent. This scientist reconstructed [NAME] and installed the cannon on its back. According to a Hiker in Ambrette Town's Fossil Lab, there is a rumor that [NAME] can be found in Glittering Cave.

By folding up its limbs and connecting its head to the cannon on its back, [NAME] assumes a disk-like form known as the '''high-speed flight configuration''' (Japanese: '''こうそくひこうけいたい''' ''Kōsoku Hikō Keitai'', ""high-speed flight configuration""), allowing it to fly at remarkable speeds. As seen in ''[NAME] and the Legend Awakened'', [NAME] can breathe in outer space. In the movie, it can also produce a sticky silk-like substance that rapidly hardens into brownish stone-like substance. It uses that material to create its nest. The movie also shows that one [NAME] may lead the others of its group, being even capable of controlling them to follow its orders.",Bug,Steel,Bug,Steel,1.0,1,"[""Bug"", ""Steel""]",656,12,668

In contrast, a female has a long, gold and red crest-like mane extending from its forehead. Female [NAME] significantly outnumber their male counterparts. The female's mane is as long as its whole body, and the light brown on its front legs extends all the way to its shoulders. The light brown fur on the male's front legs only extends up to its elbows.

Like real-life lions, [NAME] live in prides, which are led by the male with the largest mane. The pride's females protect the Litleo cubs and teach them how to hunt. The females also work together to bring down prey, ensuring the pride never goes hungry. A male [NAME] is usually lazy, but will protect its friends at the risk of its own well-being. In battle, the male [NAME]'s mane can heat up to over 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit (2,000 degrees Celsius), which can cause severe burns when approached. [NAME] viciously threatens any challenger with a fiery breath exceeding 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (6,000 degrees Celsius). However, it prefers its meat raw and does not use its breath on its prey. [NAME] typically lives in grassy plains and mountainsides.

[NAME] is a nurturing Pokemon that protects its young at all costs. It can move really fast, even with the baby in its pouch. The baby leaves the pouch only rarely until it is three years old. In order to avoid crushing the baby, [NAME] sleeps standing up. If the mother feels the environment is safe, it will allow its young to play. However, it will violently attack anything that it sees as a threat to its young. As mentioned in Sleep, [NAME] will defend the baby in its pouch, even while it sleeps. If the baby is awake but the parent wants to sleep, [NAME] will lie down to sleep while the baby sits on top of its back. They are known to raise other species of Pokemon alongside their own children, and records exist that describe a childless [NAME] raising a lost human child. Regardless of how badly injured it becomes, the mother will not cease fighting until its young is safe. It uses quick jabs to intimidate its enemies. Although it was nearly hunted to extinction, [NAME] can be found in savannahs and other grasslands.

Porygon-Z,474,Virtual,"Although technically a virtual, manmade Pokemon, [NAME] does have a physical body. Its head is fuchsia and ovoid in shape with a short, blunt antenna protruding upwards and a blue bill similar to that of a duck. Its eyes are yellow and have black rings, similar to a bulls-eye. The head is completely detached from the body and floats slightly above it. Its smooth, ovoid body is fuchsia with a blue ring connecting its arms. Two arms are loosely connected to their upper body and, other than their blue color, have no features. The tail is also blue and featureless but slightly resembles a paddle.

[NAME] was given additional software in order to increase its abilities further, and its offensive power has greatly increased. The initial idea was to give Porygon2 the ability to travel through alien dimensions, but it did not work as planned. Instead, the resulting Pokemon began showing highly erratic, unstable behavior and twitchy movements, making it difficult to work with for research. As a result, it is believed the experiment to create [NAME] was a failure. This has been attributed to the incompetence of the engineer improperly updating its programming. Academics can't seem to agree on whether [NAME] should be considered a true Evolution of Porygon2. In ancient Hisui, people were confused about [NAME] and its evolutionary relatives due to them arriving through space-time distortions and being the product of far more advanced technology than what was available at the time.

Its wings seem to be perpetually spread outwards on its sides. Its tail feathers appear asymmetrical, with a slit between them on one side.

[NAME] is a gluttonous Pokemon with an instinctive desire to swallow anything whole. It generally hunts for prey along riverbanks. Its preferred prey is Arrokuda, but sometimes it tries to swallow other Pokemon such as Pikachu, attempting to spit them out if it realizes its mistake. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, [NAME] is known to occasionally sleep while still swallowing its prey. The reason for this behavior is unknown to everyone, including the [NAME] itself.

[NAME] is quite strong, to the point where it can knock out some opponents in one hit. However, it is also rather unintelligent, forgetful, and bad at learning, as the energy used by its brain is minimal. It tends to focus more on battling, but sometimes it can't remember what it is battling mid-fight. Despite this forgetfulness, [NAME] never forgets Trainers that it trusts. However, it will try to attack its Trainer if they try to steal its food.

[NAME] is feared and despised by people and farmers for the destruction it causes with its ferocious gales when unleashed. It often comes into conflict with Thundurus, having fought each other since the beginning of time. [NAME] can unleash mini icy whirlwinds along with surrounding itself with a wind shield to protect itself from harm. It attacks with savagely cold winds that cause both body and spirit to tremble.

According to legend, it appears before doomed travelers lost in icy regions. As seen in ''Freeze Frame'', [NAME] sometimes aids travelers and guides them to safety. [NAME] lives in cold, isolated locations such as snowy mountains filled with permafrost. It is also shown to be territorial in ''The Power of One'', immediately moving to conquer the territories of Moltres and Zapdos in their absences, and fighting among them thereafter. When fighting alongside them, however, their combined power can defeat Lugia. As seen in ''Pokemon Horizons'', like other Legendary Pokemon, [NAME] can be found in the Pokemon paradise Laqua.

The front of [NAME]'s body also has a few spikes to the left and right, along with a small hole resembling a frown located just below its eye, although this hole does not function as its mouth. On [NAME]'s sides are eight cylinders, each one tipped with a purple stain. The two longest cylinders reach out towards the back and flare out at the ends; these cylinders function as the Pokemon's exhaust. The remaining six cylinders sit on top of the two long cylinders, with three on each one.
[NAME]'s large, cylindrical mouth is located on top of its body and resembles air filters found on muscle car engines. This mouth has jagged serrations resembling teeth and contains a long tongue, which [NAME] uses to unleash toxic fluids. The top and bottom halves of the mouth do not connect with each other.

[NAME] typically attaches itself to rocks that resemble the wheels and the body of a wagon, which it uses as a means of locomotion. It can create gas by combining the minerals in the rocks with its poison. The gas is then detonated in its cylinders to generate energy for itself. This aggressive Pokemon uses the sounds of its exhaust to threaten foes. [NAME] typically levitates and flies around in the air instead of moving on the ground. [NAME] are capable of running machines when attached to them; this is evidenced by the Starmobiles, which are vehicles Ortega created for [NAME] to run as an engine alongside Varoom. The [NAME] running the Starmobiles are larger than others of their species.

Melmetal,809,Hex Nut,"[NAME] is a large, silver Pokemon with a vaguely humanoid build that consists mostly of liquid metal. Many dark-gray hexagonal nuts are embedded in or attached to its body: one around each shoulder, one around the center of each arm, one in each hand, one in each foot, and a small light gray one in the center of its torso. A large, golden hexagonal nut encircles its neck and a smaller one acts as its head. Floating in its head is a small, dark gray sphere which may be oscillated. It has a small red tail resembling an electrical wire.

According to Professor Willow, [NAME] lived in a secluded area deep within a wooded land that was full of sedimentary rocks rich with magnetite, and its shed metal was used by ancient people to create unique metal tools. The process of Evolution has hardened its body, making it incredibly sturdy. However, it is still in a liquid state and has some flexibility, particularly in its heavy hex nut arms. [NAME] applies centrifugal force on its arms, allowing it to have the strongest punches of all Pokemon. When it attacks, the nuts encircling its arms slide down as if to bulk up its fists.''Pokemon: Let's Go, Pikachu! & Pokemon: Let's Go, Eevee!: Official Trainer's Guide & Pokedex'', p. 362 It is said to be created when one strong Meltan absorbs the group it lives with in order to evolve. When it reaches the end of its life, it will rust and break down into small shards, from which new Meltan will be born. In ancient times, [NAME] was worshiped for its ability to create metal from nothing. After its death 3,000 years ago, its worshippers placed the Meltan born from it inside Mystery Boxes as a way for [NAME] to return in the future.

Sandile,551,Desert Croc,"[NAME] is a short, quadrupedal Pokemon with a long snout and tail. Its body is mostly light brown with the exception of black stripes crossing over and under its legs and its pink underbelly. It has a black stripe on its snout in front of its eyes, and black covering the tip of its tail. Its eyes resemble shaded binoculars and are shrouded in a black membrane all around their front. This membrane prevents sand from getting in [NAME]'s eyes and helps it see in the harsh desert sun. Its long snout is tipped by two protruding nostrils, and its mouth comprises the bottom half. Its feet are flat and contain three sharp, black claws. They are attached to stubby legs on its sides.

[NAME] is only found in deserts, with the exception of Alola, where the warm environment is comfortable enough for them to appear elsewhere. It usually burrows under the surface of the sand, with only its nose and eyes appearing above ground. Due to being so close to the surface, it can move around the desert and allow the heat of the sand to regulate its body temperature. This also serves as a way of hiding from enemies. Its movement through sand has been described as being similar to swimming. When the sun sets, it burrows deep into the sand to sleep until sunrise. As seen in the BW episode ''A [NAME] Gusher of Change!'', in the wild, [NAME] can be mischievous and potentially troublesome to humans. However, [NAME] will protect another of its species, and can be caring at times. [NAME] is an ambush predator, hiding under the sand and waiting for unwary prey, such as Trapinch, to walk over it before it bites on their legs. However, [NAME] is not very skilled at hunting prey, thus it also mostly eats anything that collapses in the desert; hence it has been known as ""the cleaner of the desert.""",Ground,Dark,Ground,Dark,1.0,1,"[""Ground"", ""Dark""]",669,76,745
Kyogre,382,Sea Basin,"[NAME] is a massive, whale-like Pokemon with two big pectoral fins, each with four white square-shaped nails.

[NAME] is believed to be the personification of the sea itself, and is also described in mythology as the creator of the world's ocean. [NAME] is among the most powerful Pokemon, capable of summoning intense rainstorms to cloak the world's entire sky. As [NAME] slumbers in Seafloor Cavern, it is coated in a layer of rock that will be shattered if it is awakened by the Blue or Red Orb. It is said to have expanded the ocean by generating heavy rainstorms and tidal waves. [NAME] is hailed as a savior for quenching areas of the world plagued with drought. 

[NAME] is normally calm and peaceful, but if it encounters its rival, Groudon, [NAME] will engage in a cataclysmic battle against it. This battle can only be stopped by the intervention of Rayquaza. [NAME] is known to enter a deep slumber after this conflict with Groudon. [NAME] is able to fly when it has no water to swim in. [NAME] can attack its foes with many beams of blue light energy or by summoning jets of water. [NAME] generally lives deep in the ocean and is said to rest in a deep trench. [NAME] loves [NAME] Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered it in the past.

At the end of its abdomen is a light green spinneret. It has six light green legs with opaque bubbles around the joints. The tips of its legs are dark gray.

[NAME] uses the bubble around its head as both a weapon and a protective shield. The bubbles it launches will have a sticky effect. It will headbutt enemies with it, and small Pokemon can be sucked in and drowned. Foes it traps inside these bubbles will lose consciousness before getting torn apart by [NAME]'s gnashing jaws. Subdued prey can also be stored inside when the [NAME] is not hungry. However, it will also bring weaker Pokemon and valuable items into the bubble for protection. Notably, it carries around its Dewpider children while feeding them with food within the head bubble.

A special [NAME] in Alola acts as the Totem Pokemon for Lana's trial in Brooklet Hill. This [NAME] possesses Z-Power, an energy that originates from Ultra Wormholes and takes the form of a golden, flaring aura. The reward for defeating Totem [NAME] and completing the trial is a Waterium Z.

[NAME] has a large, rounded abdomen with three black, chevron-shaped stripes extending from its waist down its front; female [NAME] has larger abdomens than male [NAME]. [NAME]'s legs are defined by large hip joints, thin thighs, and wide calves, and its feet end in a clawed toe on each side. Its arms appear similar to pincers of animals from crustacean group like crabs and the presence of markings resembling eyes gives the illusion of additional heads.

[NAME]'s slender body belies tremendous offensive power. Its body and muscles are made of metal that is as hard as steel, with pincers strong enough to crush any hard object. They can be opened and closed like jaws and are patterned with black eyespots with yellow ""pupils"". It will raise its pincers and wave them around to scare off predators or foes, giving it the appearance of having three heads. When it identifies an enemy, [NAME] will use its pincers to beat up the opponent to the point there is nothing but scrap left afterwards. [NAME] is normally incapable of flight, instead it quickly flaps its wings to regulate its body temperature to prevent itself from becoming too hot and melting, although it still can hover and glide for short distances, as shown in the games and animated series.

It has a relatively small head with bright purple antennae that converge with its mandibles to form a mask around its eyes. The eyes themselves are black and angular with light gray pupils. Behind its head and curving down its back are several armor plates, each with a long protrusion curving up from each side. There is a small, greenish triangle marking on the center of each plate. Most of its lower body is exposed, but there is additional armor resembling a loincloth around its waist and smooth pieces encasing its thighs and feet. Its feet each have a single black claw. [NAME] has three pairs of arms. The two foremost pairs are thinner, encased in a silver exoskeleton, and each is tipped with a single, black claw. The hindmost pair of arms is longer and has much larger forearms. These large forearms both have three overlapping, armored plates on the back and two black claws. The plate closest to its claws is plain, while the last two each have two greenish, triangular markings.

[NAME] has a shell as tough as diamonds and retractable claws that can cleave seawater in two. While it is skillful in battle, it often meditates peacefully deep in seaside caves. It is sometimes accompanied by Wimpod. [NAME] will do anything to win a fight. When it sees an opening to take advantage of, [NAME] will use the small claws on its front legs to finish off its opponent. Grapploct is the natural predator or prey of [NAME], depending on who wins the fight.

Durant,632,Iron Ant,"[NAME] is an insectoid Pokemon with a steel body that has three distinct sections. Its ovoid abdomen is dark gray with a light gray band wrapping around the middle, and two circles resembling rivets near a jagged seam on either side. [NAME]'s thorax is slightly smaller, but identical in design with its abdomen — the only difference being one circle on either side instead of two. Its head is spherical and similar in appearance to its body, being mostly light gray with dark gray sections on each side, and two circular rivet-like circles on the forehead. On each side of its head are large red eyes with hollow black pupils. [NAME] has two round mandibles that it uses to grab things and feed itself. The mandibles are attached below its eyes and are situated in front of its horizontally opening mouth. Atop its head are two long antennae, each tipped with small spheres. [NAME] has six black legs sprouting from its thorax. Each leg has one claw at its tip, except the front legs that each have two.

[NAME] are extremely territorial. They form colonies and use their mandibles, which can crush rocks, to dig underground nests through mountains. These nests are designed to be maze-like, with complicated, interconnected tunnels. When a [NAME] colony is threatened, each individual performs their own different roles together in order to keep out and fight back intruders, such as their natural predator Heatmor or a Sandaconda looking to eat the eggs in their nest. [NAME] protect themselves from Heatmor by covering their bodies in steel armor and using their mandibles to attack. As seen in the BW episode ''Battling the Leaf Thieves!'', [NAME] prefers to eat vegetation, namely leaves. It will attack swiftly and aggressively if bothered, but will not pursue intruders once outside of its colony.

It has a long neck and short legs protruding from its fluffy body. The feet are blue, with four toes, three claws forward, and one backward. The tail comprises five feathers, the outer two longer than the inner ones.

This Pokemon uses its wings to catch updrafts and soar across the sky calmly and gracefully. It gracefully glides through the clouds, often while singing or humming in a soprano voice. Its voice seems to have special properties that induce a dreamy state for listeners. [NAME] can be very affectionate, enveloping people it has bonded with in its cotton-like wings. While normally kind, [NAME] can attack foes with shrill cries without mercy if provoked. As shown in the HZ episode ''Liko and Amethio'', [NAME]'s beak is strong enough to shatter boulders. According to Solana in the AG episode ''Pokemon Ranger - Deoxys' Crisis!'', [NAME] uses geomagnetic fields to navigate their flight, and any disturbances can affect their sense of direction. [NAME] is often found living in forests, though it also inhabits mountain ranges. [NAME] has been shown to enjoy water in both the animated series and the Trading Card Game, although if its wings are exposed to too much of it, they lose their fluffiness, revealing their actual anatomy. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, [NAME] is known to sleep while wrapped inside its wings. While sleeping in its soft, beautiful wings, [NAME] may be enjoying the most comfortable sleep ever.

On its back is a stiff, three-peaked yellow fin, resembling a crown; there is an identical fin on its underside. It also has long barbels. The barbels are white on a female and pale-yellow on a male. A long-lived [NAME] is able to utilize its immense splashing power to leap high enough to scale mountains. It also has a strong enough immune system to survive in the most polluted of waters. However, it is usually overlooked by Trainers because of its perceived weakness: even in the heat of battle, it will do nothing but flop around. It is believed that the ancestors of [NAME] were actually much stronger than modern [NAME], and this led scientists to research this species.

[NAME] is found in many bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, and ponds. However, due to its weak swimming ability, it usually lives downstream of the water's flow. In Generation I, Splash was its signature move. It is often seen using Splash to leap out of the water, which makes it an easy target for predators such as Pidgeotto and Pidgeot. Frillish is also known to prey on [NAME].

In Hoppy Town, there are at least 31 unique pattern varieties of [NAME], with their scales coming in colors such as gray, black, white, purple, pink, violet, apricot, and brown. These patterns can be classified by groups, depending on how the [NAME] looks while it is still small; a specific pattern arises when it becomes bigger. Which patterns can be caught depend on the type of Old Rod; the better the rod, the more groups of patterns can be fished. The people in Hoppy Town train their [NAME] to jump the highest in order to compete in a series of Leagues to win prizes.",Water,,Water,,1.0,0,"[""Water""]",670,9,679
Zarude,893,Rogue Monkey,"[NAME] is a simian Pokemon resembling a baboon or mandrill. Its body is primarily covered in coarse black fur, though its chest and belly are patterned with shorter gray fur.

The eyes themselves have red sclerae, green irises, and black, slitted pupils. Its teeth are pointed and its canines are visible when its mouth is closed.

[NAME] can extend prehensile vines from its wrists, neck, and the soles of its feet at will. It uses these strong and flexible vines to attack, swing from trees, and collect food from a distance. [NAME]'s vines can also rapidly heal wounds when wrapped around them, and absorb energy from trees. While resting, only the tips of the vines at [NAME]'s neck and feet extend beyond its skin. However, the vines extending from [NAME]'s wrists are typically wrapped around its forearms in four concentric rings. Occasionally, [NAME]'s vines tear off and become nutrients for the soil of the forests it lives in. As shown in ''Secrets of the Jungle'', the number of vines can vary, and may indicate a [NAME]'s age or importance, with [NAME] possessing the most vines being the oldest or most dominant.

[NAME] are social and live in troops. They're usually incredibly aggressive, and frighten most other Pokemon. They attack anyone that aren't part of their pack; they excel in battle with their sharp claws and quick wit.

The larger head has a cream-colored skull-and-crossbones marking below its face, while the smaller head has a ring marking instead. It is covered with many geyser-like protrusions, which usually expel mustard-colored gases. [NAME] is said to form when poisonous gases pool and two Koffing fuse over many years. Very rarely, two Koffing can become a [NAME] in a short time span because of a sudden mutation. Triplet [NAME] have been discovered, although they are extremely rare.

Each of [NAME]'s heads contains a different toxin. It mixes its gases by inflating one head and deflating the other. When its gases mix, [NAME] becomes more toxic and putrid. [NAME] can hover in midair, presumably due to gases lighter than air, as is the case for Koffing. Despite their stench and poison, [NAME]'s gases can be used to make top-grade perfume by diluting them to the highest level.

[NAME] lives in urban areas. It seeks a dirty, unkempt house and nests there. At night, when the people in the house are asleep, it will go through the trash. [NAME] feeds on the dust, microorganisms, and especially gases emitted by garbage and toxic waste. [NAME]'s body expands and smells worse upon inhaling poisonous gases. The Kantonian [NAME] used to be common in Galar and created more potent toxins than their Galarian relatives.

[NAME] is sometimes mistaken for the Japanese monster, and the physical inspiration for [NAME], the Kappa due to its general humanoid shape, beak, and webbed hands and feet.

[NAME] is a fast swimmer, capable of out-swimming even the most athletic of humans because of its webbed appendages. Even rough seas do not hamper this Pokemon's swimming abilities, and it will sometimes rescue people from shipwrecks. The TCG depicts [NAME] with the ability to shoot massive jets of water form both of its hands simultaneously, using them to propel itself underwater. The gem on its forehead glows when it uses its psychic powers, and occasionally when it swims at full speed. In the past, this Pokemon was overhunted due to the belief that the gem granted people supernatural powers. As seen in Pokemon Adventures, [NAME] has the ability to give knowledge to its Trainer and fellow Pokemon through telepathy. [NAME] can typically be seen swimming in lakes, where it hunts fish. The prey is disabled, captured, and then brought to shore for consumption. Old tales claim [NAME] punishes those who defile their rivers by dragging them in and taking them away.

[NAME] emits alpha waves strong enough to induce headaches, and can even cause clocks to run backward, machines to malfunction, and delicate devices to cease functioning altogether. The waves increase further in strength the more danger [NAME] faces. By closing its eyes, it can double the number of alpha particles it emits. When it has a headache, the alpha waves become unusual. All of [NAME]'s brain cells work in unison while it uses its powers. It sleeps while levitating, using its springy tail like a pillow. It can store up psychic energy inside its star in preparation for its Evolution. There is a theory that [NAME] was born from a transformed human child who could not control his powers.

(399-400&nbsp;kg) of food per day before returning to its slumber, although it can also eat while it is resting. It is not a picky eater, as its strong stomach allows it to eat even moldy food without feeling any ill effects. Once a [NAME] enters its slumber, it is almost impossible to wake it up. A Poke Flute is one of the few things that can awaken [NAME] from its slumber. It can even handle thorny plants or Muk's poison. [NAME] is docile enough to let children and small Pokemon bounce on its large stomach. Despite its apparent laziness, however, [NAME] can exhibit tremendous power when prompted. In the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''Snack Attack'', [NAME] is shown to be capable of swimming in the water. [NAME] is known to appear without warning in villages and steal their food supplies, such as rice granaries, which has long been considered a disaster whenever it happens.

[NAME] is a female-only species with no male counterpart.

A kindhearted Pokemon, [NAME] will share its eggs with injured people and Pokemon. However, [NAME] will never share its egg to those with evil hearts. The eggs become more delicious if [NAME] is raised with love and care. [NAME]'s egg is used as a high-class cooking ingredient due to the nutrition it has. As a result, [NAME] have been referred to as ''doctors' doubles'' because of its eggs. Due to its egg being over-harvested, [NAME] is extremely rare in the wild and is said to bring good luck and happiness to those who manage to catch it. Fleeing from those seeking its egg has made this once-slow species much quicker on its feet than in the past. It is more commonly found in urban settings. [NAME] is the only known Pokemon capable of using the Lucky Punch item. In Legends: Arceus, if the player is injured, any nearby [NAME] will come to check them out, and then flee when they're fully healed. They don't actually heal the player, however. As mentioned in Sleep Style Dex, [NAME] has been observed sleeping while holding its egg carefully. It is believed [NAME] is doing this to prevent its egg from cracking. [NAME] has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: ''Seated Sleep'', ''Nodding-Off Sleep'', ''Egg-Minding Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''.

[NAME] is a smart, sneaky, and notoriously vicious Pokemon, and blends well into the night in order to ambush their prey. [NAME] feeds on Eggs, such as those of Pidgey, that it steals from unattended nests. It uses its claws to poke a hole in the Egg before slurping the contents out. It has been known to form pairs to hunt: one [NAME] will lure the parents away from their nest, while the other steals their Eggs. Although the [NAME] pair works together, they will also fight over their hunt among themselves. As a result of its Egg-based diet, [NAME] are despised by Breeders to the point where they try to drive away or eradicate the former. [NAME] also preys on Alolan Sandshrew, but the Sandshrew's skin is so hard that it can cause [NAME]'s claws to snap off.

Wartortle,8,Turtle,"[NAME] is a bipedal, indigo reptilian Pokemon similar to a turtle. It has brown eyes, a dark blue streak on each cheek, and two sharp teeth protruding from its upper jaw. It has three clawed fingers and pointed toes. On each side of its head are feather-like ears covered in pale blue fur. A brown shell with a pale yellow underside encases its body. A thick, white rim separates the upper and lower halves of the shell. An older [NAME] may have scars and algae growing on its shell. Poking out of the bottom of the shell is a thick, wavy tail that also has light blue fur and cannot be fully withdrawn into its shell. Its tail fur will darken with age. Its tail symbolizes longevity and good luck, making this Pokemon popular with the elderly.

Because it is larger than Squirtle and has a larger shell, [NAME] has a more difficult time walking on land and keeping its balance in the water. [NAME] moves its furry ears and tail as both rudders and balancing rods to maintain balance while swimming at high speeds. Air can be stored in its fur for extended underwater diving. It hides in water when hunting and emerges to surprise its prey. It's shown in the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''Beach Blank-Out Blastoise'' that [NAME] can be found living in colonies on islands. Still, its preferred habitat seems to be freshwater ponds and lakes. As shown in Pokemon Sleep, it is known to sleep with its body tucked into its shell while remaining wary of threats. It leaves its long, furry tail poking out a bit to feel out its surroundings in case of danger. [NAME] has four different sleep styles: ''Sheltered Sleep'', ''Unsheltered Sleep'', ''Flattened Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''.

Hatterene,858,Silent,"[NAME] is a small humanoid Pokemon with a thin, white body. Its head is round and has a small mouth, narrow black eyes with white pupils, and two elliptical pink markings over each of its eyes resembling eyelashes or eyebrows. It has extremely long, layered, symmetrical hair, far longer than its body is tall; much like a cloak, the hair on its head drapes to the ground and swathes around it to conceal much of its true body, which is adorned by a pink semi-translucent dress that gives it a much taller silhouette, resembling that of a stereotypical sorceress or witch. This hair is colored in a gradient of baby-blue, pale pink, and white from its upper portions downwards. The hair above [NAME]'s head is shaped like a wide-brimmed witch's hat with a conical shape serving as the crown of the hat formation. Extending from the pointed end of the hat is a single tentacle that ends in a pink bulb and a consecutive baby-blue, hand-shaped bulb that has a trio of sharp claws, which can articulate in a manner similar to fingers, jutting out of it. [NAME] is a female-only species.

[NAME] has a solitary and reclusive nature, emitting psychic powers strong enough to cause headaches. This is employed as a method to deter others from approaching and disturbing it. It has also been observed that it dislikes loud noises, tearing apart perpetrators with the claws on its tentacle as a result. As shown in the JN episode ''Must Be Our Heroes and the Witch!'', [NAME] plays with people's minds and creates illusions, deceiving them for its own pleasure. Due to its long hair obstructing its floating body, [NAME]'s main forms of locomotion are levitation and short-distance teleportation. This Pokemon lives in forests with no other living creatures nearby, and as such it is known as the Forest Witch.

Its feet have three claws on the front and one on the back. Poking out of the bottom of its shell is a stubby tail.

The powerful cannons on this Pokemon's back can produce water blasts that can pierce steel and concrete and be used for high-speed charges. The speed of [NAME]'s charges is similar to the force of a rocket. [NAME] makes itself heavy to withstand these powerful blasts and crush its opponents. It is shown in the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''Beach Blank-Out [NAME]'' that [NAME] can take the role of a leader in large groups of Squirtle and Wartortle. Its preferred habitat seems to be freshwater ponds and lakes. [NAME] is capable of flying by propelling itself with water from the back openings of its shell. As shown in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] is known to sleep soundly while protected by its tough shell. [NAME] has also been seen sleeping with its belly exposed on very rare occasions. This is due to [NAME] feeling completely secure in its surroundings and quickly falling asleep. [NAME] has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: ''Sheltered Sleep'', ''Unsheltered Sleep'', ''Overturned Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''.

Donphan,232,Armor,"[NAME] is a gray, proboscid Pokemon with a thick, black band of hide running down the length of its back and extending to the tip of its long trunk. When this Pokemon curls up, the band resembles a car tire. This tough hide prevents regular attacks from inflicting even a scratch. A pair of white tusks, which are smaller on the female, extend from the corners of its mouth. It has thin, elongated ears held out almost perpendicular to its body. Its four short legs are each encircled with a broken, black band and have three toes.

[NAME] has the ability to curl up into a ball and violently roll around like a wheel. These rolling tackles are strong enough to knock down a house. While normally calm, [NAME] can become enraged and start a rampage. Once it starts its rampage, it will be almost unstoppable. [NAME] will chase after anyone who angers it. The AG episode ''Date Expectations'' showed that this ability is further used as a form of courtship. The male [NAME] have rolling competitions to demonstrate their toughness to the females. A [NAME]'s tough hide is so strong, not even a car can scratch it. Despite this, the armor is extremely vulnerable to rain.

In the PTS episode ''Roll On, Pokemon!'', it is shown that [NAME] has a keen sense of smell, capable of sniffing out a gem known as amberite (Agate in the Japanese version). [NAME] travels in herds with a ranking system. The larger its tusks, the higher its rank in the herd. It lives in rough, mountainous terrain. 

Both Great Tusk and Iron Treads share a resemblance to [NAME]. Great Tusk is theorized to be [NAME]'s ancestor from the dinosaur era, while Iron Treads is believed to be a descendant of [NAME] or a scientific weapon sent to the Pokemon world by aliens, but according to a version of Professor SadaS/TuroV that appeared at the Crystal Pool, both Pokemon are counterparts of [NAME] from parallel timelines.",Ground,,Ground,,1.0,0,"[""Ground""]",696,9,705

Each foot has a sphere on it: blue on the left and pink on the right. Around its neck is a white frill with a hole in the center.

[NAME]'s head is a white ball with a multitude of pink and blue dots, which are a collection of tiny sparks. On either side of the ball are stars that are blue on the outside, pink on the inside, and have yellow dot-like eyes on the center. The head is not attached to the body and can be removed for use as a weapon. As seen in Pokemon Refresh, the color of the sparks and the color and shape of the stars change with [NAME]'s mood. It is known to trick its targets through the silly way it walks before blowing its head up without warning, shocking them in the process; it then steals their vitality to use as energy. Like all Ultra Beasts, [NAME] stores Z-Power, the same energy possessed by Totem Pokemon, within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura. As seen in ''Twirling with a Bang!'', this Ultra Beast can freely move its head around easily and regenerate it after blowing it up. As depicted in the same episode, [NAME] and Xurkitree have a rivalry with each other, often competing in contests to see who can shine the brightest.

Like Stakataka, [NAME]'s homeworld is one of the only worlds which is not seen and cannot be visited riding Solgaleo or Lunala through Ultra Warp Ride.

Extending from the top of its head is a horn that resembles an old-fashioned key with two wide, blunt teeth. Extending from either side of the key is a thin loop that surrounds [NAME]. Hanging from the loop are various keys that this Pokemon has collected. As seen in the TCG, the loop is highly mobile and can split both at the top and the bottom, allowing [NAME] to collect new keys and even express its feelings. [NAME] is very tiny, tying with Alolan Diglett and Meltan as the shortest Steel Pokemon.

[NAME] are known to be even-tempered Pokemon. In the past, [NAME] inhabited mines, but when the minerals on which it fed became scarce, it moved into human settlements. It now feeds on metal ions by inserting its key-like horn into chinks in metal. It likes to collect keys, particularly master keys, and will sneak into people's homes to steal them. It collects keys to feed on their metal ions, as well as to threaten predators by rattling its collection at them. It is said that [NAME]'s key-like appearance is the result of an adaptation to suit its habit of collecting keys. Although it feeds on keys, it will never release a key it likes, holding onto to it for decades, so people will give it important keys as a way to prevent theft. However, on rare occasions, it will discard a key without second thought. In the past, nobles kept [NAME] for generations, taking great care of them while entrusting them with important vault keys.

[NAME] is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Fairy Lock. In Generation VI, Crafty Shield was also one of its signature moves.

According to locals, worshipping [NAME] will grant kindness and help ensure things are 'okey-dokey' between both sides. Even with its greedy and arrogant personality, [NAME] has great relationships with its teammates, talking to each other in private and acting together to defeat their opponents. By consuming the Kitakami Mochis, [NAME] can become a Titanic Pokemon.


In myth, it is said that [NAME] was once a smaller, weaker Pokemon. A desire for strength led it to meet the Mythical Pokemon Pecharunt which, in need of retainers in its journey to Kitakami, used its Binding Mochi and toxic chains to tame and transform [NAME]. This resulted in the toxic chain being wrapped around its neck, chaining [NAME] to Pecharunt's will. [NAME] transformed as the chain enhanced its capabilities, granting it a powerful physique by stimulating its muscles heavily. The toxic chain, when thrown, is powerful enough to let [NAME] pulverize anything it hits. It is a ruffian with a short temper.

Its tail fins are white, and it is capable of using them as feet to stand up.

[NAME] uses water balloons and its voice as its main weapons. Because its voice is instrumental in its battle strategy, its care should be a priority for Trainers. The melody it uses has been passed down for generations. Water balloons are released as it dances, and are controlled by its voice. In the moonlight, the balloons glitter and create a beautiful scene. However, some of the balloons are explosive and triggered by touch. This theatrical Pokemon considers every battle a stage and uses the non-explosive balloons as platforms to tease opponents.

[NAME] awakens at dusk and moves during the night. It has a fondness for anything sparkly, and it will go as far as fighting with other Pokemon, such as Meowth or Gabite, in order to gain their stashes. However, it is also known to give these sparkly objects to Trainers that it is fond of. Whenever it is chased, it loses the attacker by leading it down dark mountain trails, and sometimes it does this to travelers as a mean-spirited prank. Its thieving and nocturnal nature has led it to become representative of misfortune. It was believed that saying, ""Workrum, Workrum—bad luck, don't come,"" would serve as a protective incantation to drive away bad luck caused by seeing a [NAME]. It is possible to train a [NAME] to repeat words, as seen under Team Rocket's ownership. [NAME] usually live in flocks (referred to as ""murders"") amongst forests and swamps. [NAME] may also act as a servant of Honchkrow; with groups of at least 100 flying in at Honchkrow's call. There is a saying for [NAME] that goes, ""Get home before the [NAME] fly.""

[NAME]'s body is mostly beige brown, with pine green colorations on its face, forelimbs, and chest — the latter patterned to resemble a vest or overalls. Its ovular head is adorned with two large black eyes with squinted white pupils, along with four eye-like protrusions on either side. It also has rhombus-shaped pedipalps protruding from its sides to evoke a mustache, and two chelicerae bunched together to form a shield shape, which hides a circular mouth. [NAME]'s abdomen is cylindrical and cloaked in bands of its white silk to resemble a spool of yarn, ending at the tip with a flat conical peg containing its ninth spinneret.

[NAME] is a covert ambush predator that utilizes its sticky and resilient silk threads to cling upon any surface and move without making a sound. It spins a silk thread from the spinneret on its abdomen, which it uses to hang upside-down from tall places. It then spins a net between its top four legs which it uses to smother its prey, striking before the prey has time to react. It prefers sticking onto the sides of trees, and strings its territory with silken hazards to trap intruders. It actively spars against its rival, Scyther, to maintain its ground and ensure the safety of its Tarountula young.

[NAME] has many hidden capabilities. It has darkly colored nictitating membranes that allow it to analyze for an opponent's weak point. These special lenses can also detect body heat. Once [NAME] finds a foe's weakness, it will start attacking. This also helps it precisely shoot water from its fingertips at Mach 3. The membrane on its back is extendable and allows it to glide in the air. The blue streak on its tail hides sharp, retractable frills which it uses similarly to a knife. [NAME] is highly intelligent, carefully thinking out strategies before entering combat to ensure a swift and decisive victory. It is also known to be quite chivalrous and is completely loyal to Trainers it sees as worthy. As seen in JN, [NAME] can camouflage itself like its pre-evolved forms and has access to infrared vision.

Early TCG cards state that [NAME] is able to release poison from the spikes on its head, which it uses to chase away enemies. It has a very joyful nature. As a result, it is said that it shares its joy with those who take care of it. Because of its disposition, [NAME] is seen as a sign of good luck, especially if a Trainer is capable of getting a sleeping [NAME] to stand. [NAME]'s innocent smile is said to calm the soul.

It was shown to be capable of firing its ""feet"" like bullets before reloading with a new set from inside its body. It has been seen releasing attacks from its six connected wings similarly to a cannon.

The mark that would be the ""palm"" of the paw is actually the lower half of the claw. Its four legs are short, with pointed tips that are freezing to the touch, as shown in Pokemon Refresh.

Its Evolution was triggered by exposure to the snowy mountains. [NAME] grew its fluffy fur to resist the icy cold of its mountain habitat. It can also store cold energy in its claws. [NAME]'s claws can deliver powerful strikes capable of smashing ice walls or halting avalanches. In desperate times, the claws can even be fired like rockets. Additionally, [NAME] can freeze its opponents in place by firing icy bubbles from its mouth, which is useful since [NAME] has a slow movement speed.

Unlike its present-day and future relatives, [NAME] does not typically curl up into a ball, likely due to the size of its tusks. In the ''HZ'' episode ''Total-lie Awesome Pokemon in Area Zero?!'' however, it was shown to be able to do so by using the move Rollout.

The space on the back has only a single blue dot. There is a golden half-circlet on both the top and bottom half of its body, which divides it exactly in half. Two wispy extensions containing starry specks serve as its arms. [NAME]'s gaseous body makes it one of the lightest Pokemon in existence.

[NAME] lives in another world named Ultra Jungle. Its proboscis is said to be harder than a diamond. [NAME] is powerful enough to destroy a dump truck with a single punch. According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation, [NAME]'s most distinctive feature is its skill to strengthen itself. [NAME] is able to absorb energy and then achieve a chemical reaction between the energy it has absorbed and its own body fluids.

As a result, [NAME]'s body swells to an almost explosive extent. Its muscles bulge and are so thick and dense that they are even stronger than steel. Both its offensive and defensive capabilities experience a clear leap in power. It also displays a habit of striking a pose each time that it takes any sort of action, it is thought this might serve as a method of communication, but it is not well understood.

This Pokemon resides on volcanoes, where it camouflages itself among the rocks and waits for prey. In addition to hunting, [NAME] also feeds on sulfur and other volcanic materials. This diet rich in explosive material has contributed to a layer of explosive material in its shell. This diet also makes [NAME]'s feces dangerously explosive. The feces can be put to many different uses; in Pokemon Adventures, they can be used as makeshift landmines, exploding from a mere touch. When prey steps onto its shell, it strikes itself with its own tail to cause an explosion. The explosion is ignited by sparks from the spikes on its shell and released through the hole on its chest. This orifice also acts as [NAME]'s weak point. Its explosive capabilities are dampened by the rain, however, so it takes refuge in caves on rainy days. [NAME]'s shell can be employed defensively as well. It is also capable of spewing poisonous gas and flames from its nostrils.

Passimian,766,Teamwork,"[NAME] is a black-and-white Pokemon resembling a powerfully built lemur with broad shoulders. Most of its fur is white, but it has a black muzzle, upper body, hands, feet and ankles, and tail. However, there is a wavy white ring near the tip of its tail. The fur around [NAME]'s head and face is longer and forms many small clumps, especially around the top of its head and under its chin. On top of its head is a pale green helmet similar to half of a coconut shell. The helmet has a small orange blaze on the front and two leaves that stand up straight attached to the back. Its eyes are partially hidden by its headwear, but its yellow sclerae and reddish-orange irises are visible. It is often seen carrying a large berry that resembles a green coconut. There are several leaves stuck on its body with saliva. The shoulders and chest all have one vertical and one horizontal leaf. While most [NAME] have green leaves, it's shown in the SM episode SM064 that there is a red leaf variant on Akala Island that has one additional horizontal leaf in each area. The leaves' color and position are decided by the leader of a troop and aid in distinguishing one troop from another.

This Pokemon creates troops of 20 to 30 members. Each troop has a leader that picks 10 of the strongest members to search for food. [NAME] tend to get into territorial disputes with Ambipom in their search for comfortable trees, in which they win half the time. This Pokemon's battle strategy involves throwing berries at opponents, hard ones for damage and soft ones to obscure vision, and confusing opponents by throwing the berry to other troop members. A troop's leader is the member that can throw these berries the farthest. Through rigorous training, the troop improves its coordination, teamwork, and skill in handling berries. Some [NAME] are unable to handle the intensity and flee from the troop. In place of a troop leader, a captive [NAME] looks to its Trainer for leadership. If its Trainer has poor form when throwing Poke Balls, it will refuse to obey.

This Pokemon buries itself on the seafloor, leaving only the growth on its head exposed. By emitting a low level of psychic power, it serves as a radar to detect prey. Additionally, the protuberance can emit a strong psychic power. Opponents bathed in this power are stricken with terrible headaches and fall unconscious. Prey, which includes Shellder and Mareanie, are ground into mush and eaten. Toxapex is a rival of [NAME] in warm ocean currents.

When emitting psychic power, [NAME] grinds its teeth, which stimulates its brain and creates psychic energy. This sound is enough to send nearby Pokemon fleeing immediately. In the Alola region, lifeguards allow this Pokemon to remain in their area to prevent other, dangerous Water Pokemon from gathering. Any sunlight reflecting on [NAME]'s ripples will cause the water to shine brightly.

[NAME] is found in temperate grasslands where reedy plants grow, guarding the plants from anyone trying to disturb them. However, [NAME] is rarely seen, and thus it is thought that its numbers are decreasing, and that it is at risk of extinction. According to sources such as ''Pokemon the Series'' and the Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia, its population decline is caused by humans who hunted it down for food; one popular recipe suggested cooking it with its own leek. There have been attempts at breeding in order to increase the [NAME] population. In the Pikachu short ''Pikachu's Vacation'', [NAME] are shown to be able to swim like real-life ducks.

In Generation IX, Fire Lash is its signature move. Additionally, prior to Generation IX, [NAME] and its pre-evolved form, Salandit, were the only known Pokemon that could have Corrosion as an Ability.",Poison,Fire,Poison,Fire,1.0,1,"[""Poison"",""Fire""]",753,76,829
Naganadel,804,Poison Pin,"[NAME] is an Ultra Beast that has both draconic and insectoid features. Its upper body is slender with thin arms and a long neck. The upper chest, neck, head, and arms are light purple, while its waist is dark purple with a fuchsia stripe on each side. Each shoulder has a long gray spike, and each hand has three pinkish-purple claws. Running down each side of its neck is a dark purple stripe, which connects and forms a loop on its chest. The lower area of the loop is fuchsia and has a short, downward extension in the middle. At the end of its long neck is its head, which has a long, spiked crest on the top. On the sides of its mouth are a pair of curved, gray spikes that act as mandibles. Its glowing cyan eyes are conjoined, rimmed with fuchsia, and have a spiky crest on either side, which gives them a visor-like appearance. A pair of light purple wings sprout from the center of its back. These wings have a single fuchsia claw at the joint, two spikes along the wing-arm, and darker purple membranes with fuchsia markings near the spikes.

[NAME] originates from Ultra Megalopolis in Ultra Space in the core series games. However, [NAME] originates from an unnamed world in the animated series. The lower half of [NAME]'s body houses its brain. It resembles a swollen wasp's abdomen and is filled with poisonous liquid. It is covered in stripes of light and dark purple and has three hollow stingers at the tip. The stingers are gray and have a fuchsia marking around them. The largest stinger is in the center; the other two are considerably smaller and sit on either side. These stingers are connected to its brain, so it will react violently if they are touched. Its main stinger can eject a luminescent, adhesive poison over a distance greater than six miles. Like all Ultra Beasts, [NAME] stores Z-Power, the same energy possessed by Totem Pokemon, within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura. In ''The Prism Between Light and Darkness!'', [NAME] is shown to be able to communicate with humans through telepathy and show them visions of the past. In the same episode, it was shown living in nests and leading large numbers of Poipole.",Poison,Dragon,Poison,Dragon,1.0,1,"[""Poison"", ""Dragon""]",756,141,897
Electabuzz,125,Electric,"[NAME] is a slightly humanoid Pokemon with a few feline traits. It has antennae with bulbous tips where its ears should be, two long tufts of fur on top of its head, small eyes, and two large fangs in its upper jaw. It is covered in yellow fur with many black stripes. There is a large, lightning bolt-shaped stripe on [NAME]'s chest, a V-shaped stripe on its forehead, one stripe on its side, a thick stripe down its back, two bands on each leg, several broken bands on each arm, and many rings around its long tail. There are three clawed toes on each of its feet, two in front and one in back, and five fingers on each hand.

In the dark, [NAME] will glow light blue from the electrical charges running across its body. It is constantly leaking more electricity than it consumes. Being near an [NAME] will cause a human's hair to stand on end. [NAME] often gathered groups around tall trees to wait for the upcoming storm. During torrential thunderstorms, [NAME] will compete to find locations likely to be struck by lightning to absorb the electric power. [NAME] is often used as an alternative to lightning rods because it is unharmed by the absorption of electricity. It is also capable of entirely nonverbal communication via electrical currents when near another of its species. Blackouts have been known to happen when groups of [NAME] gather to consume electricity from power plants, they often get blamed for the occurring power outages. As a result, Ground Pokemon are kept around power plants to keep [NAME] from raiding, although the blackouts are usually the fault of the electric companies, not [NAME]. There is ongoing research on using [NAME] to store away lightning until it is needed to be used later.

As demonstrated in the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''Showdown at Dark City'', [NAME] is sent into a rage by the color red. In battle, [NAME] windmills its arms, apparently to add momentum to its punches. This method of battle seems ineffective, as opponents can escape in the meantime. [NAME] typically resides near power plants and can cause blackouts in cities, though it can also be found in grasslands.",Electric,,Electric,,1.0,0,"[""Electric""]",727,9,736
Magnezone,462,Magnet Area,"[NAME] is a robot-like Pokemon which resembles a UFO. It is the result of Magneton leveling up in the presence of a special magnetic field. The Evolution occurs on a molecular level, but despite this, scientists have failed at attempts to force it. [NAME]'s body is comprised from a durable metal and is wide and circular, similar to a disc or saucer, with a thin edge circling the diameter of its body. Its main eye is in the center, containing a large, red pupil. On each side of its body, it has a ball-shaped addition that resembles a Magnemite, with each side containing an eye, horseshoe magnet, and Phillips head screw. These secondary eyes can move independently of its main eye, as shown in ''Confronting the Darkness!''. On top of its head is a tall, thin, yellow rod, closely resembling an antenna, which it uses for certain attacks. Behind its body is a third horseshoe magnet, positioned like a tail.

[NAME]'s Evolution is theorized to have been caused by a special magnetic field that changed the molecular structure within its body. [NAME] is a seemingly-mechanical, gender-unknown creature, but it has emotions, a way of reproducing, and the need for nourishment. With its magnets, it has the ability to manipulate gravitational energy and float through the air at will. As seen in ''Giratina and the Sky Warrior'' and Phantom Thief Pokemon 7, [NAME]'s anti-gravity is strong enough to carry humans with ease. [NAME] is rarely sighted in the wild. As seen in ''Regaining the Home Advantage!'', [NAME] can be very aggressive and territorial, although it will rarely attack without provocation. It flies through the night sky, often mistaken for a UFO sighting, though it seems to be receiving and sending signals from an unknown source and no clear purpose. This leads some people to believe that [NAME] came from outer space and that it is being controlled by unknown beings. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, [NAME]'s screws and magnets will spin while it sleeps. It is believed that a sleeping [NAME] emits signals of unknown purpose and receiving signals of unknown origin. However, researchers are divided on if this point is true or not.",Electric,Steel,Electric,Steel,1.0,1,"[""Electric"", ""Steel""]",736,12,748
Rotom,479,Plasma,"[NAME] is a small, orange Pokemon that has a body of plasma. It is mostly spherical, with a bulb below its body and a long pointed protrusion on top, making it shaped like a lightning rod. There is a whitish blue aura of electricity around it that forms lightning bolt-shaped appendages. When moving quickly, these appendages tend to disappear, in favor of a long similar-looking trail of blue electricity. It has teeth, and its unique, blue eyes have a dividing line across them. In its base form, [NAME] cannot be touched by anyone without the latter being shocked in the process. According to the [NAME] Catalog, [NAME] in its base form is possessing a light bulb. [NAME] lack any sort of circulatory system or pulse.

[NAME] have the ability to enter and control appliances. They typically use their abilities to make mischief, often using the household items they possess to pull pranks on unsuspecting people, as seen in the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''Get Your [NAME] Running!''. Despite this, some [NAME] have taken to inhabiting electronics with the intent of helping others. The [NAME] Pokedex, [NAME] Phones, [NAME]i, and Drone [NAME] are some examples. Additionally, in Galar, the [NAME] Phone is used to power the [NAME] Bike. Some of these forms allow [NAME] to speak human languages, and demonstrate that [NAME] are highly intelligent. [NAME] tend to reside in abandoned buildings. Research continues on [NAME] and its ability to power unique motors. In the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''[NAME]'s Wish!'', a specific [NAME] was shown to have the ability to time travel.

On its long neck and hind legs, there are small luminous spots. It has several other luminous patches on its body, emitting a faint blue aura. [NAME]'s face, parts of its neck, and underside are grey. The grey parts of its body have several dark grey lines connecting to different parts. On its shoulder blades are yellow metal protrusions that resemble fins. [NAME]'s legs are connected by four-leg armor parts. The lower legs have a luminous v-shape brand connecting to light armor and metal hooves. [NAME] is capable of rotating its head.

Discovered in Area Zero, it is unknown what kind of Pokemon [NAME] actually is. It resembles a mysterious object introduced in Occulture as a cutting-edge weapon shaped like a Cobalion. The glowing parts on its horns can create two long bright-blue blades that can extend before bending at the end. These can be used as energy swords or be used to repeatedly launch particle blades capable of slicing any material. There was supposedly an incident in which it destroyed everything within its environment using its particle blades. When it falls asleep, it turns itself off, causing the cyan energy on its head, horns, and legs to turn black.

According to AI Turo, [NAME] is a future Pokemon related to Cobalion. However, according to a version of Professor Turo that appeared at the Crystal Pool, [NAME] is a counterpart of Cobalion from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. [NAME] was brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Turo ten years ago. 200 years ago, Heath also encountered [NAME], as seen in the Violet Book, though it is unclear how it arrived there at the time.

On top of its head are several short spikes. Down its back are two black, spine ridges that join just past its humped shoulders. It has a black circle surrounding its head. There are two orange metal protrusions on its shoulders. The orange blaze bands around its legs are the same color as its horns and forehead. It has grey metal hooves underneath these bands. Its striped underside is also beige. The grey parts of its body have several dark grey lines connecting to different parts. [NAME] also has a short, stubby metal tail and can fully rotate its head.

[NAME] was first discovered in Area Zero and is said to have originally been an ordinary Terrakion modified by a villainous organization. It stores laser-like energy within its sharp, axe-like horns, which it uses to plow through any obstacle in its path. This energy is accumulated from the light stored within its head. It can wield this stored light to rend its opponents. The horns can additionally be imbued with psychic energy while using physical attacks. [NAME]'s name originates from a mysterious object recorded in Violet Book. While asleep, the orange energy on its head, horns, and feet turns black.

Its body is primarily dark blue, with black armor plating resembling fur covering its necks and shoulders. The inner armor surrounding its head is fuchsia in color with white spots and resembles collars. The surfaces of [NAME]' heads function as LED displays. When turned on, each of its heads glows blue with black eyes; the main head additionally has fuchsia pupils and visible pointed teeth formed from its armor plates. Like with the eyes of other future Paradox Pokemon, [NAME]' LED faces are used to display its emotions; unlike with Hydreigon, its secondary heads can emote in this manner as well. Its abdomen has two fuchsia stripes and its feet resemble fins. Its tail also sports a fuchsia stripe and ends with a black plate. 

An article from a July issue of Occulture magazine describes [NAME] as a flying life-form resembling Hydreigon that has allegedly been seen in a certain corner of Paldea. It was reported to have razed an entire building with a high-energy blast before flying off as if to find its next objective. [NAME] is theorized to be a sort of machine-Hydreigon hybrid, as it combines Hydreigon's ferocity with the ruthlessness of a machine. It is said that it takes its name from a similarly described entity in the Violet Book. It was shown to be capable of sending its secondary heads wandering by themselves independently of its body and even shooting them like missiles against its enemies. When it falls asleep, it turns itself off, causing the magenta energy on its neck plates, underbelly and tail, and the blue LED in its faces to turn black.

The mandibles extend from this helmet. They are blue on the inner surface and yellow on the outer surface. At the base of each mandible is a large spike and the inside is lined with short spikes. Its body is black and divided into three sections by yellow rings. The last two sections have a yellow spot on each side. On its back is a pair of wide, flat wings that are transparent with blue elytra. It has four legs; the front pair of legs has two claws, while the back pair has only one.

[NAME] produces electricity with an organ in its abdomen and controls it with its huge jaws to fire powerful electromagnetic beams. [NAME] shoots these to strike down bird Pokemon. When it clasps a Charjabug in its legs, it is able to utilize it as an extra battery. This allows it to rapidly fire its powerful beam attacks. However, during fierce aerial fights, it will release Charjabug to make itself lighter and more mobile. It is an adept flier, capable of acrobatic maneuvers such as tailspins and sharp turns. Even as it weaves through complicated tangles of branches in the forest, it is able to maintain high-speed flight. It is known to have a rivalry with Pinsir and Heracross. As shown in the episode ''A High-Speed Awakening!'', it likes to drink tree sap. In that same episode, it is shown that, in Alola, there is a competition known as the [NAME] race, where Trainers can have their [NAME] race for the chance to win a Buginium Z. As mentioned in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME]'s mobility is exceptional, to the point it can remain flying while it sleeps. This usually happens after intense battles, where [NAME] used up too much electricity. In preparation for its next battle, [NAME] will sleep upside down in order to generate electricity in its abdomen.

A special [NAME] in Alola acts as the Totem Pokemon for Sophocles's trial in Hokulani Observatory.

Deoxys,386,DNA,"[NAME] is an alien-like, bipedal Pokemon that has four forms, each focused on a different stat. The main components that are constant for all four forms are dominantly a red color, a light blue face, and three light blue dots on its back arranged in a triangle. There is a purple stripe running down the center of its face and a purple, crystalline organ in its chest. Its white, circular eyes are set inside rectangular, black eye sockets.

[NAME] was formed by the mutation of a virus from space. The Pokemon is highly intelligent; its brain appears to be the crystal in its chest. This organ is capable of firing laser beams. It was also shown the ability to morph its tentacles into human-like hands. While inactive, it can also take the form of a triangular, stone tablet. As shown in ''Destiny [NAME]'', it is able to regenerate any part of its body that it may have lost during a battle. It has also demonstrated the ability to create an aurora without changing its form. These auroras can have different electromagnetic wavelengths and are used to communicate with other [NAME]. It is also shown that the various electromagnetic waves given off by people, Pokemon, and all electronics can obscure its vision if there is enough interference with its communication. [NAME] can use powerful telekinesis in combat, and its different forms grant it further abilities and techniques to use in battle.
In ''Destiny [NAME]'' and Pokemon Adventures, [NAME] has been observed to create clones of itself. These clones have lifeless eyes and duller color, lack of the trademark crystal on the chest, and seem to be unable to change from the Normal Forme. Furthermore, they seem unable to morph their tentacles into hands. When these clones are defeated, they dissolve into dust-like particles. [NAME] is bitter enemies with Rayquaza, with the two often clashing with each other, as depicted in several media.

The fur is especially longer around its ears, thighs, and arms, the latter resembling poofy sleeves. Its face has lazy pink eyes and a small pink nose, and is covered in a four-pointed mask-like shape, with a pattern of three green diamonds on it. Its ears are curiously more droopy compared to its pre-Evolutions, its mask instead giving the impression of perked-up cat ears. Each of [NAME]'s hands has three fingers tipped with green claws, as well as a pink paw pad. On its neck is a pink collar resembling flower petals. This collar holds together its cape, which grows from the leaves it had around its neck as Floragato. The cape is lined with reflective fur, is black on the outside and green on the inside, and splits into two near the base, with both parts of the cape ending in fleur-de-lis shapes.
[NAME] is said to be a talented magician. [NAME] carries a four-petaled green flower, whose stem is hidden by the reflective fur on its cape, creating the illusion of floating. As seen in HZ, the flower stem can be used to bind opponents in battle. The flower can blossom into a round, pollen-filled flower bomb, with a two-tone green and black zigzag pattern on the outside, and six petals adorning the top. In a battle, [NAME] uses skillful misdirection to stealthily plant these flower bombs onto various surfaces around its unaware foes before setting them off, catching their opponents off guard. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, [NAME] occasionally attempts to perform magic while it sleeps. However, this performance tends to not go as planned.

[NAME] has a proud, showy personality; however, it is also sensitive and prone to jealousy. It can often be very attached to its Trainer, and it will become upset if its Trainer gives attention to other Pokemon.

Its neck, paw pads, and tail are also black; the latter has a white tip. Its rear has a covering resembling a motorcycle seat, located at the base of its tail. On its throat is a black sac with a white inner coloring, resembling a rubber tire.

[NAME] has a mild temperament. It has been kept by humans and used for transport since ancient times, with depictions of this behavior found in murals dating back 10,000 years ago. This relationship appears to be mutualistic since the warmth of [NAME]'s rider helps it avoid getting cold, along with lifting its spirit. When carrying a human, [NAME] can reach a speed of over 70&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h). [NAME] maintains its balance and absorbs shock while running by using its hard head and thick yet supple tail. It also uses its head and tail to attack during battles. [NAME] is strong enough to carry luggage and equipment used by humans. It has been seen equipped with metal seats and headlights, allowing humans to ride it more easily and navigate. In other cases, it has been seen equipped with a jet seat, allowing it to move faster as seen with Team Star.

Both Koraidon and Miraidon share a resemblance to [NAME], a detail noted in their own Pokedex entries and by several people in Paldea; it is later confirmed in the aforementioned games that they are ancient and futuristic relatives of [NAME], respectively. According to Jacq, [NAME] has three forms. First, [NAME]'s basic form is where it walks on all four legs. Second, the battle form is where it stands on its hind legs in order to battle. Finally, the ride form, which it assumes when humans ride on it. When [NAME] is being ridden on, it puffs up its throat sac and curls its tail, making the appearance of wheels.

Dodrio,85,{{tt|Triple Bird|TRIPLEBIRD before Generation III}},"[NAME] is a large, wingless, three-headed avian Pokemon. Each head has a long, sharp beak and a black V-shaped, feather crest. It has bristly brown feathers covering its head and upper body, while its lower half has a smooth layer of black feathers. Its tail consists of three pale red feathers with lighter tips. Its wingless body rests on two long and slender, but powerful legs with feet that have three clawed toes in front and one in back. A male has black necks, whereas a female has brown necks; both genders have brown legs.

Each head has its own working brain and distinct personality. Each head represents and expresses either sorrow, anger, or joy. Despite being separate, it has the innate ability to use all three of its brains to collect data, formulate, and then execute complex plans and strategies. However, on occasion, it may overthink, which causes it to become immobilized and unable to carry out any action whatsoever. Being separate individuals on the same body, the three heads will continue to bicker until they, or at least one of them, gets to eat. This satisfies the other two heads, quelling them and temporarily ending their infighting. The strongest of [NAME]'s heads and the thickest neck will become the leader and gain primary control of the body. Another form of adaptation that it has acquired is the ability to have at least one head alert at all times. Extreme caution is advised when all three heads are facing separate directions. It is in this state that it is the most dangerous and going near it may result in a severe pecking.

Along with its three heads, it has three sets of hearts and lungs as well. This allows it to efficiently oxygenate and pump blood throughout its body, thus giving it increased endurance to run vast distances without rest. It is especially prone to race vigorously across grassy plains, even in arid seasons with little rainfall. As a result, despite being slower than Doduo, [NAME] can keep running for an even longer time. As mentioned in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] is known to usually sleep standing up.

Across the top of its head is a white band with two tufts of fur on each end. This white marking gives it the appearance of wearing a headband with decorative bear ears. It has a short, white muzzle with a triangular black nose and two small, black eyes. There are pink paw pads on its front paws consisting of the palm and three digital pads. The hind paws have three white digital pads on the front. It has a short tail with dark pink rings.

While [NAME] may appear friendly, it is actually a very dangerous Pokemon — even considered to be the most dangerous Pokemon in Alola. It must never be approached carelessly, even if it is merely swinging its arms around in a friendly fashion, which is used as a warning. It shows affection with a fond embrace, but its hugs have incredible force. Trainers of this Pokemon must teach it how to restrain itself when showing affection. Its hugs are powerful enough to shatter bones and have killed many Trainers. The reason [NAME] hugs others is due to accepting that person as a friend. [NAME] also uses its arms to subdue its prey before taking it back to its nest. 

[NAME] is capable of using amazing martial arts moves. [NAME] is said to have learned them by observing Black Belts training in the woods. In Lental, [NAME] are known to hibernate during seasons when food is scarce. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, [NAME] on very rare occasions, is seen hugging a log while sleeping. The reason is due to it mistaking the log for a friend. However, these logs tend to be smashed to pieces accidentally due to [NAME]'s immense strength. 

As depicted in ''Pokemon the Series: Sun & Moon'', [NAME] is highly intelligent and capable of performing remarkable feats, including running on the ocean, building tools such as a wooden motorcycle, and jumping high in the air. Despite its size, [NAME] can move very fast. It is very protective of its cub Stufful. [NAME] also likes to eat Honey made by Combee and Berries.

It has gray plates on either side of the cloud and a plate beneath the cream belly fur on its chest. [NAME] has gray paws with brown pads and black cuff-like bands on its legs. Both front paws house three small, white retractable claws, which can be seen in battle or in Pokemon Camp. Its main faceplate is red and shaped like fins or a six-sided star. A gray plate, resembling a horseshoe mustache, covers its muzzle. It also has a yellow crest with three sloped points on its forehead and red eyes.

150 years ago, Brass Tower in Johto was hit by a lightning bolt, causing it to catch on a huge fire and would be later put out by a sudden downpout. Three unnamed Pokemon perished in the fire, however, the Legendary Pokemon Ho-Oh granted the trio new life, one of those Pokemon was revived as [NAME], which represents the fire that destroyed the now Burned Tower.

It is said that an [NAME] is born whenever a new volcano appears, and that whenever [NAME] roars, a volcano erupts somewhere in the world. [NAME] races across grasslands at high speeds. It does this due to being unable to contain its extreme power. [NAME] is believed to represent the passion of magma, and is claimed to be the bringer of the summer's warmth. [NAME] can unleash massive bursts of fire capable of destroying anything it touches. Its fire is said to be hotter than the magma of a volcano.

It has heavy-lidded, dark purple eyes with purple eyelids and long purple eyelashes, but has no visible mouth or nose. The lower part of its face is hidden behind a short ruff extending up from its body. While its arms are slender with rounded, digit-less hands, its legs are long and powerful. The upper portions of its legs have three pointed projections just before the hips, creating the impression of long boots. The lower portions of its legs taper into small, pointed feet. It has wide hips made up of six segments that resemble the flesh of a mangosteen. It is a female-only species with no male counterpart.

On top of [NAME]'s head is a light green calyx. The shortest leaf of the calyx extends slightly forward and then curves to the right, similar to side-swept bangs. The other three leaves resemble long hair and extend nearly to the ground. The three long leaves each have three yellow spots near the top and three near the bottom; the markings are present on both the under and upper sides of the leaves. On top of the calyx is a growth resembling a small, purple crown with four thin yellow stripes.

[NAME] is known to be both powerful and aggressive. This Pokemon has a high-class nature and punishes anyone who approaches it with evil in mind. This attitude will even be directed at its Trainer if given commands [NAME] dislikes, such as being told to use an ineffective move. Touching the crown-like growth on its head is said to render it defenseless, however, and instantly calms it down.

[NAME] fights using finely honed kicks and graceful movements. Every time it lands a hit, it cackles at its opponent. It will even continue kicking or stepping on a downed opponent, laughing boisterously. Additionally, its sweet fragrance acts as a distraction.

Xurkitree,796,Glowing,"[NAME] is a very tall Ultra Beast that resembles a vaguely humanoid mass of electrical wiring. Its ""head"" is a white, brightly glowing electric spark with numerous points and no visible face. Below its head is a mass of black cables for its torso and limbs; there are white bands resembling zip ties throughout its body as well. Its arms have ties where its shoulders, elbows, and wrists would be. The upper arms have two cables, while the lower have three. At the ends of its arms are copper structures that resemble hands, each with six flat ""fingers"". The legs have ties at the hips, knees, and ankles and are composed of four cables fused together for the whole length. The feet have four toes possessing ""claws"" of exposed copper; each foot has two fused toes pointing forward and two separate toes pointing backward. Finally, its tail has three ties and four cables, one of them loose in two sections. The tail ends in what resembles a three-pronged plug.

[NAME] live in another world named Ultra Plant. There, many have been seen unmoving, with their arms and legs stuck to the ground, similar to trees as they absorb electricity from the ground. [NAME] vary greatly in size, from being a little bigger than a human to being the size of a mountain. Because this Ultra Beast reportedly raided a power plant, it is speculated to sustain itself with electricity. Witnesses claim that its entire body crackles with astonishing electrical power. According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation, [NAME]'s most distinctive feature is an organ that can generate power. This UB's bodily makeup is highly reminiscent of electric wiring, thus enabling it to conduct electricity with great efficiency. It can discharge as much as a million volts of power at a time. When it begins to run out of power, it stabs its legs and tail into the soil, entering a treelike state as it absorbs electricity from the ground.

Wicke also claims that like all Ultra Beasts, [NAME] stores Z-Power, the same energy possessed by Totem Pokemon, within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura. [NAME] and Blacephalon have a rivalry with each other, often competing in contests to see who can shine the brightest as depicted in ''Twirling with a Bang!''.",Electric,,Electric,,1.0,0,"[""Electric""]",746,73,819
Dartrix,723,Blade Quill,"[NAME] is an avian Pokemon that resembles an owl. Most of its plumage, including its heart-shaped facial disc, is white, but it has dark brown feathers covering its head, shoulders, and back. Its large eyes contain dark irises and usually appear closed. It also has a stubby beak with a white upper jaw and an orange-brown lower jaw, and a few short tufts of feathers on the back of its head. Two green leaves curve around its face, resembling an asymmetric cut; the leaf on its right is longer than the one on the left. Under its chin are two smaller leaves that resemble a bowtie, and there are two pointed ones on its rear that form its tail. Its wings have two tan spots on the upper side and leafy plumage close to the body on the underside. Within the leaves under its wings are two sharp orange-brown feathers known as blade quills. [NAME] has orange-brown talons with two toes facing forward and one facing backward.

This alert Pokemon is sensitive to the presence of others around it, and is capable of launching attacks on unseen enemies behind it. It propels its blade quills at enemies or prey with astounding precision. By bending the feathers, it can even alter the trajectory of its strikes. However, it can occasionally miss hitting at times. [NAME] is narcissistic by nature, spending a lot of time grooming its feathers to maintain its appearance. This compulsion will occasionally lead to it losing focus when its plumage is ruffled or dirty, even retiring from battle to preen. It has been described as a bit of a birdbrain as it has a tendency to make mistakes; when it does, it sometimes tries to cover it up, which ends up making the situation worse. A Trainer who helps [NAME] through this difficult stage of its life will allow it to reach its full strength. Conversely, [NAME] will refuse to listen to a Trainer who doesn't diligently help it groom.

In Hisui, [NAME] tends to expose itself to sunlight in order to gain power, presumably due to the region's cold climate. As a result of the harsh environment, [NAME] becomes more sturdy when it evolves into Hisuian Decidueye, gaining the Fighting type instead of the Ghost type.

Quaquaval,914,Dancer,"[NAME] is a humanoid avian Pokemon resembling a waterfowl. Its plumage is mostly dark blue, except for the light blue on its shoulders and tail, along with the white on its head, neck, chest, and individual tail feathers. Its face has blue eyes and a pointed yellow beak. Atop its head is a large, flowing, slick, dark blue crest, with long light blue and orange-red feathers at the front, separating the crest from the head. Its forearms have three sets of feathers, each tipped with light blue; and it has what resembles hands with three ""fingers"" each. Additional light blue accents decorate its waist and legs. Its yellow feet have bulbous segments with three toes each; the front-most segments are orange in color. It has a defined rump and an elaborate-looking tail, with a circular base and three teardrop-shaped feathers decorating it at the top, along with two chains consisting of three feathers flanking it on either side.

In battle, [NAME] is accompanied with a series of teardrop-shaped decorative water feathers, which are ejected from the organs on its tail feathers and fanned out behind its back. When attacking, these water feathers move forward and spin around [NAME]'s body, making a buzzsaw-like arrangement that it uses to slice into its enemies. [NAME]'s legs are well-trained and have incredible strength, being able to launch a truck away with a single kick. It uses its legs to perform dance moves, some of which appear to be based on dances from faraway lands. [NAME] is viewed by Tsareena as its rival. [NAME]'s dances can mesmerize all those who see it. Even while [NAME] is asleep, it has been seen swaying its whole body at every opportunity. On occasion, a sleeping [NAME] has been seen striking elegant poses.

[NAME] has a cheerful and energetic disposition, dancing away no matter what situation it faces. However, it can also express a more serious demeanor, especially when it comes to consistently polishing its skills. It can become very focused during critical situations.

Basculegion,902,Big Fish,"[NAME] is a large, green, fish-like Pokemon. It has a jagged mouth with pointed teeth. Its spine is aligned with a dark gray line, with colored stripes that flank it on either side and extend around its gills, along with spots scattered across its body. These accents are red in male [NAME], and light blue in female [NAME]. Their eyes also match the appropriate color, and they look fierce on males and drowsy or sad on females. It has a pair of white pectoral fins, a three-spiked dorsal fin, and a two-spiked ventral fin. Additional smoke-like features cover [NAME]'s face in a manner resembling barbels; female [NAME] sport shorter ones and lack the two small fins that the males have on their chin, instead having more blue markings around their lips and eyes.

[NAME]'s Evolution is achieved by a White-Striped Basculin being possessed by the souls of other Basculin in its school who did not survive their harsh journey swimming upstream. These souls wrap around [NAME]'s body, particularly along its rear half. They are colored red on male [NAME], said to be caused by the souls' rage; and light blue on female [NAME], whose paleness resulted from the sadness within the souls. When it senses danger, [NAME] will turn hostile and attack along with its souls until the enemy is defeated. The souls within [NAME] are said to have a will of their own and provide [NAME] with the power needed to swim on without tiring.The souls enable [NAME] to navigate even the most turbulent rapids with ease. Male [NAME] are known for their powerful jumps, while female [NAME] can conjure and control terrifying illusions against its opponents. [NAME] is said to have no equal in the rivers of the Hisui region. In the present day, it's only known to be found in Kitakami's Timeless Woods along with its pre-evolved form.

A special male [NAME] is worshiped in Hisui due to being a descendant of one of the 10 ancient Pokemon who received a blessing from Arceus. In particular, it is one of the Ride Pokemon who resides in Cobalt Coastlands, watched over by the warden Iscan. This special male [NAME] is known to assist humans.

Fezandipiti,1016,Retainer,"[NAME] is an avian Pokemon with a small head, a short beak with a magenta tip, and a long neck and legs. Its plumage is primarily black, with white on its head and neck, and bronze accents on its face, collar, and wing tips. It stands atop a pair of long slender bronze-colored legs having three-toed feet with sharp claws, and its tail consists of a long train of bronze-colored feathers ending in forked tips that gently curl outwards. A single white stripe accents each of its legs and tail. A crest of black feathers resembling a cap sits atop [NAME]'s head, with golden feathers sticking out resembling a royal crown. A pair of magenta plumes also sits just above each of [NAME]'s eyes like eyebrows and extend like long streamers with forked ends. Hanging from [NAME]'s chest is a pair of magenta toxic chains, protruding from a shawl-like feature that wraps its body. [NAME] is a male-only species with no female counterpart.

[NAME], together with Okidogi and Munkidori, are known as the Loyal Three, the heroes of Kitakami. The three are beloved by the people of Kitakami as heroes that once protected the land from the ""evil ogre"", and stone statues bearing their likenesses were made by the people as an expression of their gratitude right where the three had been buried. According to locals, worshipping [NAME] leads to both good luck and serendipitous fortune. Even with its greedy and arrogant personality, [NAME] has great relationships with its teammates, talking to each other in private and acting together to defeat their opponents. By consuming the Kitakami Mochis, [NAME] can become a Titanic Pokemon.


In myth, it is said that [NAME] was once a Pokemon with short, dull feathers. A wish to be beautiful led it to meet the Mythical Pokemon Pecharunt which, in need of retainers in its journey to Kitakami, used its Binding Mochi and toxic chains to tame and transform [NAME]. This resulted in the toxic chain being wrapped around its waist, chaining [NAME] to Pecharunt's will. [NAME] transformed, enhancing its capabilities and giving it a stunning appearance and a lovely voice. It possesses powerful pheromones, capable of captivating both humans and Pokemon with a beat of its glossy wings to scatter them through the air.

Unown,201,Symbol,"[NAME] is a flat, thin Pokemon shaped like a circular eye with appendages that make it resemble a letter or a punctuation mark. It is entirely black, except for its white sclerae. All 26 alphabetic forms of [NAME] have fully open eyes, while the two punctuation forms have half-closed eyes. Though each of its forms has a counterpart in the Latin alphabet, [NAME] is said to resemble ancient writing and hieroglyphs called [NAME] symbols. It is a mystery whether [NAME] predates or postdates written language, and therefore which one is based on the other. [NAME] can move its appendages independently like tentacles or fingers.

In the Japanese version of Crystal, a researcher implies that the [NAME] began appearing at the Ruins of Alph after the Pokemon Communication Center was built in Goldenrod City. This text was translated and left unused in the English release.

The Pokedex, [NAME] Report, and Professor Oak's research disagree on whether [NAME] communicates using electromagnetic waves (specifically radio waves) or telepathy. Either way, it can be detected by the Pokegear radio, which interprets it as the melody of the Azure Flute. [NAME] has an unknown connection to Arceus. It is said that an ""odd power"" emerges when more than one [NAME] come together. Certain [NAME] loose in the Hisui region were capable of repelling Poke Balls that contained Pokemon, preventing them from being battled. Professor Laventon's research observed that [NAME] resemble human writing from other lands, though no one took him seriously. In the Pokemon movie ''Spell of the [NAME]: Entei'', [NAME] is shown to be capable of reading the thoughts of other life forms. Great numbers of [NAME] are capable of distorting reality to suit the dreams and wishes of whoever is in control of the [NAME]. However, they can only do this when more [NAME] are present, so it could be a shared effort rather than an ability unique to each [NAME].

[NAME] is an extremely rare Pokemon that lives in its own dimension and rarely ventures outside. When it moves to the Pokemon world, [NAME] tends to stick to walls like engravings of ancient texts, or orbit other [NAME], usually in ruins.

In Pokemon Crystal, the [NAME] are said to share a cooperative bond with Suicune.

Morpeko,877,Two-Sided,"[NAME] is a short, chubby rodent Pokemon who can change forms via its signature Hunger Switch Ability, which alters its appearance. The features shared between the two forms are short, stubby arms and feet; a pair of pink circular cheek pouches; a very tiny nose; two almond-shaped ears with a single fur tuft under each; and a primary body color separating two areas of fur which cover the arms, ears, cheeks, and eyes, and zigzag inward towards its face, stopping at the waistline. These fur patches form pockets that it can store seeds in. On the back of its body is a pattern resembling a Pikachu's tail that extends from the bottom half of its fur. In its Full Belly Mode, its body is a creamy yellow, and its eyes are circular and black with large white pupils. The fur on the left side of its body is black, and on the right side, it is brown. A single bucktooth can be seen protruding from its smiling mouth. While in its Hangry Mode, [NAME]'s primary body color turns purple, its eyes become downward-slanting red semi-circles, and its right-hand patch of fur turns from brown to black so that it matches the other side. Its mouth is also constantly formed into an angry snarl.

[NAME] carries around Berry seeds that have been electrically roasted in its pockets. It treats the seeds with care as if they were precious treasures until it eats them as a snack. The seeds it stores keep [NAME]'s hunger at bay due to its small stomach. Unless [NAME] continues to eat its stored seeds, it will become instantly hungry. [NAME] generates electricity with its cheek sacs; this process consumes a lot of energy and causes it to become hungry no matter how much it eats. By experiencing prolonged hunger, the hormones in [NAME] shift in balance, and its fur color changes. As a result of intense hunger, [NAME] becomes aggressive, driven into committing all kinds of evil deeds and enacting extreme violence until their hunger is satisfied. The energy within its cheeks also changes from Electric to Dark. Hangry Mode [NAME] has a wild, brute-like nature while in this form. However, as seen in the JN episode ''Crowning the Chow Crusher!'', once [NAME] is fully fed, it will refuse to eat more food and attack anyone who tries to feed it.

It uses this distinctive look to harshly intimidate opponents. Its eyes are very powerful, with variable focus, allowing it to see things at a great distance, even in the middle of a desert. Its other notable feature is its long snout, containing a black stripe around the bridge, and large pointed nostrils on the end. Four of its rear and two of its front teeth slightly overlap its lower jaw. [NAME]'s jaws are extremely powerful, giving it the ability to crush objects as large and durable as an automobile. The jaws can twist a body before breaking it in half. These features are topped by [NAME]'s highly violent temper. It has been known to clamp down on any moving object and will do everything it can to make sure its prey cannot escape. [NAME] coexists well with Flygon in searching for food, hiding in the sandstorms that Flygon creates as they hunt, then splitting the prey that they manage to catch.

[NAME] has been known as the ""Bully of the Sands"". It uses the sandy terrain as cover to patiently wait for prey to pass by, even throughout the day without rest. [NAME] can swim through the desert sands as if they were water. [NAME]'s powerful jaws can easily shred thick plates of iron.

Poltchageist,1012,Matcha,"[NAME] is a Pokemon made of matcha tea powder that inhabits a tea caddy; specifically a 茶入 ''chaire'', a kind used in the traditional Japanese tea ceremony. The tea caddy is primarily black and white, with a white lid, a sealed crack near the top, and a painted pattern resembling a face (and functioning as one, being able to change to express emotions). [NAME] is always seen carrying a 茶杓 ''chashaku'', the tea scoop used to transfer tea powder into the tea bowl in the aforementioned tea ceremony.

[NAME] heavily resembles Sinistea, although they are not biologically related. On top of its matcha body, just below its lid, is a yellow swirl pattern similar to the one found on Sinistea. On Sinistea, this swirl pattern serves as its weak spot and will cause it to become dizzy if stirred; however, this is not the case for [NAME].

According to an old tale, [NAME] was born from the regrets of an old tea master, who was so obsessed with perfecting the art of the tea ceremony that he drove away everyone around him.

[NAME] tends to scatter its matcha powder on people and food. If someone touches or ingests the powder, they will notice their skin apparently glowing for a brief moment, before they fall unconscious as their life force is sapped away by the powder for [NAME] to use as energy. It is capable of draining energy in this way from many people at once. Another behavior exhibited by [NAME] is its strong tendency to repair broken objects and seal cracks by filling them in with its matcha powder.

[NAME] was known to be very proud and arrogant, preferring to serve those it deems the strongest. It once ruled over the Crown Tundra like a lord, terrorizing its residents for intruding on its territory. This lasted until it was defeated and tamed by Calyrex using the Reins of Unity. [NAME] has a fondness for carrots, particularly Iceroot Carrots. It also loves [NAME] Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered it in the past.

By combining with Calyrex, [NAME] can channel a cold temperature up to −508&nbsp;°F (−300&nbsp;°C). The cold temperature allows Calyrex's psychic abilities to reach their full power, with a range of at least 30 miles. [NAME]'s endurance also increases to the point it can run up to seven days and nights. This allows the powered up steed and Ice Rider Calyrex to smash and freeze anything in its path no matter the difficulty of the road.

Two small claws, one on each hand, serve as its thumbs, and one large nail on each foot make up its toes. It has two small spikes on its back and a short tail. On its head, [NAME] wears the skull of its dead mother as a helmet. Because of this, much of its actual face has never been seen, except for its triangular, black (sometimes green or blue) eyes and a small area surrounding them, and in its Bandai Namco card a bit of its mouth, where it has a pair of a few sharp teeth and a long pink tongue. The skull has two rounded horns on the top of its head and a tooth-like point on the lower sides. Under the skull, [NAME] has a brown snout. This small Pokemon survives only through the immense skill it possesses in wielding the bone it carries as a weapon.

It is called the Lonely Pokemon because of its tendency to keep to itself and avoid social situations, due to the trauma caused by the death of its Marowak mother. [NAME] will often weep at night in mourning of its mother. When [NAME] cries, the skull that it wears on its head vibrates and emits ""a plaintive and mournful sound."" On the night of a full moon, the cries are said to be especially terrible. [NAME] seems to recognize a likeness of its mother in the full moon, and so it howls with a particular sadness.

It has a yellow- and black-striped abdomen, which flares out from a thin, waist-like protrusion under its thorax in a manner that resembles an elegant ballgown. Underneath the expansive abdomen are seven orange, honeycomb-like cells that serve as a nest for baby Combee; the centermost cell, however, surrounds what appears to be a slender, yellow, more insect-like abdomen, which is often obscured by the ‘gown’ part of its abdomen. [NAME] has black arms that each consist of two thin, conical segments. Each arm ends in two small, orange claws. It flies with a pair of relatively small wings, each of which consists of two stacked, translucent teardrop segments.

Its orange face has intimidating red eyes; yellow mandibles that protrude from its face and connect to its horns; and a large, red gem on its forehead. [NAME]'s horns are yellow near its face and black at the tips, and with the gem, they resemble historical headpieces or crowns worn by European royal and noble women in the Late Middle Ages, such as the escoffion.

Similar to queen bees in real life, [NAME] is a female-only species. [NAME] is the sole queen of a hive of Combee, which it commands by releasing pheromones.

They are willing to use their full power to protect themselves or their partners. When a male [NAME] continues to emit its powerful psychic energy, it will damage its body as a side effect.

The female [NAME] is predominantly white. Its ears have no markings and curled tips and its eyes are red with yellow sclerae. The organ in its ears is red with a yellow ring. The tuft of fur on its head is blue and curled, as is the collar around its neck. Its tails are blue at the base and end in white, fluffy curls. There are blue, stocking-like markings around its paws and two tufts of fur on each hip. 

Female [NAME] are known to be more selfish, aggressive, and aversive than their male counterparts. Should the female [NAME] not get what it wants, it will torment anyone with its psychic abilities. Female [NAME] generally have a stoic expression even when using their psychic powers. When they sense danger, they will unleash their psychic power at its maximum strength, with no regard for their opponents.

Cinderace,815,Striker,"[NAME] is a bipedal, rabbit-like Pokemon. Most of its torso and head, as well as its arms and tail, are white. [NAME] has long white ears, the insides of which are yellow. Its white eyes, which have red-orange irises, have a deep navy pattern below them and yellow eyebrows above them. These eyebrows connect at the nose, which is red-orange, and form a ""crown"", which connects to the red-orange tuft of hair sticking out from its forehead, similar to a flame. It has two whisker-like tufts of white fur on each side of its face. Over each shoulder is a navy patch of fur, resembling a shoulder brace, which continues down the torso and connect at middle of the chest, creating what resembles a sports tank top. This navy-colored fur is also seen on its lower torso, creating what resembles a belt. The fur on its lower body is colored red-orange and resembles a pair of pants, with yellow pockets and ending in yellow tufts at the knees, with little tufts of fur on the backside of its thighs. Its ankles and feet are colored navy-blue and tipped red-orange at the toes. On the underside of each foot, there are three yellow dots of fur, from which it fires flames when attacking opponents.

By juggling a pebble with its feet, [NAME] can transform it into a burning soccer ball. By putting a spin on the ball, it can launch attacks that its opponents struggle to evade. The shots it fires can leave an opponent scorched. [NAME] has great offensive and defensive capabilities, being one of the best at explosive force, jumping ability, and kicking power. Due to its strong core and great balance, [NAME] can unleash powerful kicks from any position. In battle, it uses artful footwork to feint and throw its opponents off. This move allows [NAME] to blind its opponents and keeps them at bay. [NAME] can get pumped up with excitement should it get cheered on. However, it may get itself in trouble if it starts showboating. Despite easily losing its cool, it will follow the orders of its Trainer without flaw.

[NAME] is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the moves Pyro Ball and Court Change. [NAME] and its pre-evolved forms are also the only known Pokemon that can have Libero as an Ability, which allows them to change their types. As seen in the JN episode ''A Flood of Torrential Gains!'', the tuft of red hair on [NAME]'s head changes in color when it changes its type.",Fire,,Fire,,1.0,0,"[""Fire""]",798,9,807
Iron Treads,990,Paradox,"[NAME] is a quadrupedal Pokemon with a spherical gray metallic body and a black underbelly. On its face are a pair of short black tusks and a black half-moon pixelated screen, which usually displays a pattern of a pair of angry red eyes; underneath them is a metal plate that can be retracted to reveal its mouth. Its most prominent physical feature is a segmented tread jutting out from its back, and extending to the front of its face. This tread is black and has bright red glowing patterns accenting it. [NAME] also has long black plate-like earlobes, and metal plates covering its legs, which can be retracted to aid in its rolling attacks.

[NAME] is said to have a cruel nature. It is capable of swiftly curling up its body and rolling like a wheel to attack. According to the Pokecology book, [NAME]'s tire-like armor is what allows it to rotate and move around. [NAME] will additionally curl up into this form and rock itself back and forth when sleeping. The trails it leaves behind are described as similar to scorched earth. It also reportedly fatally injured one of the explorers of the Area Zero Expedition team in the past. In an article from a September issue of Occulture magazine, it is said that there have been reports of [NAME] in an arid corner of Paldea. It is said to resemble Donphan. Rumors suggest that [NAME] is some kind of weapon using technology not of this world, though this is unproven. When it falls asleep, it turns itself off, curling itself into its wheel form and causing the red energy on its treads to turn black.

According to AI Turo, [NAME] is a future Pokemon related to Donphan. However, according to a version of Professor Turo that appeared at the Crystal Pool, [NAME] is a counterpart of Donphan from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. [NAME] was brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Turo ten years ago. [NAME] was the first Paradox Pokemon to be discovered 200 years ago in Area Zero by the Area Zero Expedition team and recorded by Heath in his Violet Book. How it arrived there at the time, however, is unclear.

At some point, one individual escaped Area Zero and consumed Herba Mystica. This [NAME] became the Quaking Earth Titan, one of the Titan Pokemon found in Paldea. It mainly resides near a hidden cave in Asado Desert, where it feeds on Sour Herba Mystica.",Ground,Steel,Ground,Steel,1.0,1,"[""Ground"", ""Steel""]",796,268,1064
Jirachi,385,Wish,"[NAME] is a small, white, humanoid Pokemon. It has short, stubby legs and comparatively longer arms. There are flaps on the underside of its arms, which give the impression of long sleeves. On its belly is a curved seam, which conceals a third, yellow eye with a cyan pupil, known as its ""true eye"". Additionally, [NAME] has a normal pair of ovalish eyes on its face, with small, blue triangular markings underneath. On its head is a large, yellow structure with three points extending outward: one from the top and one on either side. On each point is a teal tag, known as a ""wish tag"". A rounded extension hangs from either side of the yellow structure, framing [NAME]'s face. Two yellow streamers flow from [NAME]'s back, resembling comet tails.

[NAME] hibernates for most of its life, awakening for seven days every thousand years. It can be also awakened if sung to by a voice of purity. While it sleeps, a tough, crystalline shell envelops its body to protect itself. However, as seen in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, it can still fight while asleep. During the short periods it is awake in, [NAME] will grant wishes. However, how its wish powers work differ between canons. In the ''[NAME]: Wish Maker'' movie, M06 cannot create objects through its wishes, instead, it'll teleport the wished object to the one who wished for it. By contrast, in the BW episode ''Searching for a Wish!'', it can grant wishes without the use of teleportation. In the Pokemon Adventures manga, [NAME] will only grant wishes when its true eye is opened. Additionally, it can only grant three wishes every thousand years, which are written on each of its three wish tags. It was also shown being able to create artificial Pokemon through its wishes, animating a mass of seawater in the shape of a Kyogre. [NAME]'s power is similarly exploited in the movie to create a monstrous Groudon. The movie further reveals that [NAME]'s awakening is linked to the appearance of the Millennium Comet and that its third eye has the ability to absorb the energy [NAME] needs for hibernation. In Pokemon Adventures, [NAME] was shown to slumber in space. It is said that [NAME]'s ability to grant wishes also gives it great attack power, as seen when it creates a concentrated bundle of light to blast its target. Although it is extremely rare, [NAME] can be found in the mountains.

Iron Hands,992,Paradox,"[NAME] is a large, bulky cyborg Pokemon that looks like a futuristic sumo wrestler. The head crest is a deep blue with ten black lines connecting across it. The head is light grey with cylinder-like ears. The two eyes are yellow within a black faceplate. The upper half of their body is colored light gray resembling a light armor gear with two bright yellow holes with white spots on each side of where the shoulder would be. Also connected to it is a grey belt with three yellow square armor-like pieces on each side with white spots as well. The lower half is grey with several black line markings. The half-sphere legs are colored dark blue which are connected to small yellow rectangles with white spots. The black feet are shaped like shoes with one small, yellow rectangle with white spots connected to each foot. It has two giant, three-fingered hands which it uses. The back side of their hands is light grey with a yellow circle in the center with three white spots each. The front is four large, bright yellow rectangles connected and black lines. The rectangles also have several white spots as well.
According to an article from a May issue of Occulture magazine, [NAME] got its name from an iron-handed entity described in the Violet Book. It is said to have fists that move independently of its body and to be capable of throwing large, fast-moving vehicles. An unproven theory claims that [NAME] was once an athlete who became mortally wounded but was kept alive by being made into a cyborg. It strongly resembles Hariyama, though why this is remains unanswered. It has been seen releasing energy from the panels in its palms after pressing them against each other. It was shown to be capable of hovering a short distance above the ground to perform fast movements, such as running or turning around. When it falls asleep, it turns itself off, connecting its hands to its body and causing the yellow energy on its palms and armor pieces to turn black.

According to AI Turo, [NAME] is a future Pokemon related to Hariyama. However, according to a version of Professor Turo that appeared at the Crystal Pool, [NAME] is a counterpart of Hariyama from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown.

Raikou,243,Thunder,"[NAME] is a quadrupedal, yellow, tiger-like Pokemon with black stripes and a white underside. It has a thin, light blue tail with sharp angles and a spark-shaped formation at the end. Most of its face consists of thick, white fur and shorter yellow fur around its red eyes. [NAME]'s muzzle is a light blue ""X"" and it has a black faceplate with two bumps that cover its forehead, nose, and ears. [NAME] has two long fangs that make its appearance similar to the saber-toothed cat. Its large claws each converge to form a single point and never retract. Extra fur hangs off its body in front of its thighs. [NAME] has a mane across its back that resembles dull purple rain clouds and allows it to shoot bolts of lightning.

150 years ago, Brass Tower in Johto was hit by a lightning bolt, causing it to catch on a huge fire and would be later put out by a sudden downpout. Three unnamed Pokemon perished in the fire, however, the Legendary Pokemon Ho-Oh granted the trio new life, one of those Pokemon was revived as [NAME], which represents the lightning that struck the now Burned Tower.

A proverb claims that [NAME] descended from the sky with a lightning bolt. [NAME] is able to fly by creating storm clouds, as depicted in the Pokemon Ranger: Guardian Signs (animated special). In ''The Legend of Thunder!'', [NAME] is shown to be distrustful of humans, though it may form some friendship with those who help it. [NAME] tends to appear during thunderstorms and when other Electric-type Pokemon are in danger. [NAME] is said to represent the speed of lightning and can control storm clouds at will. [NAME] races across grasslands while barking cries that sound like thunder. [NAME]'s cries can also send shock waves in the air while shaking the ground at the same time. [NAME] loves [NAME] Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered and raced up a mountain with it in the past. Raging Bolt bears a resemblance to [NAME]. According to Occulture, Raging Bolt is believed to be an ancestor of [NAME].

As mentioned in  the Sleep Style Dex, while [NAME] is sleeping, its breath makes a rumbling sound similar to distant thunder. The moment [NAME] awakens, it will quickly travel the lands, with a roar sounding similar to a crashing thunder. [NAME] is known to enjoy eating [NAME] Biscuits. [NAME] can be lured over to a sleeping spot using the [NAME] Incense. [NAME] has three different sleep styles it sleeps in: ''Energy-Storing Sleep'',  ''Meditative Sleep'', and ''Lightning Sleep''.",Electric,,Electric,,1.0,0,"[""Electric""]",832,73,905
Gastrodon,423,Sea Slug,"[NAME] is a sea slug-like Pokemon. Much like its pre-evolved form, it has a slug-like body with a round head and a mantle covering the top half of its body. It has six stubby legs and two black eyes with white pupils, with a mark imitating a third eye appearing on its forehead. A yellow stripe runs along the edge of its mantle, through its two lower eyes, and around the back of its head. Like Shellos, [NAME] has two forms based on the sea it lives in.

In its West Sea form, it has a pair of large tentacles on its head that curve upward and a smaller, straighter pair on its neck. Its underside is pink, while its mantle is brown, with three pink spots on each side of its back. There are also two lumps on its back, resembling the cerata on real-life sea slugs.

In its East Sea form, it retains the head tentacles it had as a Shellos, which are now fully green and angled slightly further upward. Its underside is turquoise, while its mantle is forest green with two turquoise spots on each side. It has a pair of yellow, fin-like cerata on its back and a wavy yellow line bordering its side and rear.

[NAME] and its pre-Evolution Shellos are examples of allopatric speciation, although the two forms can still breed with each other. It is also a relative of Shellder and Cloyster. When threatened, it oozes a purple liquid and flees. While not poisonous, the fluid is very bitter and sticky. Its mucus-coated body is soft and squishy yet surprisingly resilient, and it leaves behind a trail of sticky slime when moving on land. It also has strong regenerative capabilities that allow it to recover from injuries or dismemberment within a few hours. In ancient times, it had a shell on its back, which gradually became a thin yet hard vestigial plate.

[NAME] lives in shallow tidal pools, beaches, and rocky shorelines. Its diet consists mainly of plankton, but it is occasionally known to move onto land to look for other foods, such as beach sand. When it finds prey, it melts it with mucus before eating them. While [NAME] cannot stay out of water for too long due to its body being highly vulnerable to dehydration, it becomes more active during cloudy or rainy weather. It has been found on far-off mountains during times of constant rain. The two forms of [NAME] are known to engage in heated conflict with one another. West Sea [NAME] was much more numerous in the past than it is in the present. Conversely, East Sea [NAME]'s population has visibly increased in population as of late.",Water,Ground,Water,Ground,1.0,1,"[""Water"", ""Ground""]",823,12,835
Falinks,870,Formation,"[NAME] is a group of small, bipedal Pokemon. A single [NAME] is a formation of six individuals, similar to Exeggcute. It consists of five troopers and a leader, known as ""the brass"". [NAME] usually march in a single file line headed by the brass, giving their formation the appearance of a caterpillar. This formation is known as the Column formation. However, [NAME] occasionally break their formation to attack.

The six members rely on teamwork as their strategy to win battles, and constantly change formation when they fight. The five troopers follow their brass loyally, and the brass's orders are considered absolute by them. [NAME] are capable of fitting into small holes, as shown in Galar, where they can be seen marching and charging through small caves and crevices. A common formation that the members change into is a form in which the troopers stand in a triangular formation around the brass, either in front of or behind it. This formation is known as the No Retreat formation, as the members stand in this formation when using the move No Retreat. In JN, the six individual [NAME] are shown to occasionally stand upon one another to execute certain moves. In UNITE, it is shown that the brass may also dispatch troopers to attack on their own, with this strategy being known as the Dispatch formation.

An individual [NAME] trooper has a black, spherical body with two stout, trunk-like legs. They also have blue, ovular eyes which can either be interpreted as being white or glowing slightly from their dark body. Each trooper has a golden, armored shell resembling a Spartan helmet that covers their dorsal half. This shell is topped with a red horn that continues into a small crest. The lateral sides of the trooper are protected by two horned plates resembling shields. Each of these shields features a red, central horn ringed in white. Each trooper also has a small red horn on their posterior resembling a tail.

The [NAME] brass is the largest, strongest, and most intelligent out of the six members. It has a larger crest with an extendable horn it uses to attack and issue orders. The horn is supported by a golden anterior strut absent in the troopers. The brass's golden shell extends to the ventral half of its body. Unlike its troopers, the brass's lateral shields can be opposed. The brass's shields are often chipped or nicked. When [NAME] is marching in formation, the brass holds its two shields in front of its face.

Palossand,770,Sand Castle,"[NAME] is a Pokemon resembling a yellowish sand castle with gray pebbles along the base. It has a square main castle for its body, two round towers for arms, and the top of another round tower with a conical point rising up from the body. A tunnel through the center of the main body creates a mouth. There is a line of five alternating blue and pink seashells over the top of its mouth, and a similar ring of seashells surrounds the central tower just below the point. The central tower has six windows: three located in the front, one on each side, and one in the back. The two outermost windows in front of the central tower have tiny pebbles in them and appear to act as eyes. The two side towers have crenellations along the top with a ring of windows underneath. [NAME]'s main body has crenellations around the central tower. In the peak of its tower is a red shovel stuck handle-first into the top.

[NAME] has the power to control the sand, and each grain of its body has a will of its own. It curses and control people and Pokemon alike, making them gather sand for it to build upon its body. Unlike Sandygast, [NAME] is able to replenish any sand it loses on its own. The shovel on [NAME]'s head rotates when it searches for prey and is believed to function as a radar. [NAME] can be found at beaches, having been referred to as the ""Beach Nightmare""; however, it hates water. It cannot maintain its castle-like structure during heavy rainfall. As seen in the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''A Shivering Shovel Search!'', [NAME] can manipulate its size to grow to the size of a building and whip up sandstorms with a swing of its tower-like arms.

[NAME] captures smaller Pokemon into its sandy body by dragging them down into the sand. Once they are trapped, it drains their vitality whenever it pleases, until all there is left under its body are the dried-up bones of its victims, which [NAME] is able to fire from the hollows in its arms. The aforementioned ''Pokemon the Series'' episode shows that trapped victims are unable to escape [NAME]'s body unless it has suffered enough damage, otherwise they will be pulled back inside; it also suggests [NAME] is not able to drain the life force of humans. Wherever it passes, traces of its victims' ill will are left, which are said to be the genesis of new Sandygast.

Its belly is angular and has a white coloration flanked by black stripes on either side, resembling an open suit jacket and dress shirt. It also has various white-colored patterns on its head, lower jaw, neck, back, shoulders, arms, legs, and the cylindrical tip of its tail. The white coloration on the top of its head resembles a lute. [NAME] has three black claws on each foot, and although it usually walks on all fours, it is capable of standing on its hind legs.

[NAME]'s head is delineated with a black circular shape at the top. It has black eyes with yellow irises and red eyelids, serrated jaws with purple insides, and various square and triangular patterns that come in red, orange, yellow, and purple. A wreath of solid orange-and-yellow fire energy emerges from the back of [NAME]'s jaws, which circles around its head.

There is an orange fiery bird resting on top of [NAME]'s head, which is a separate, independent entity from the Pokemon. This bird is spherical, with a yellow face, white eyes, a short crest and tail, and a singular tiny pointed ""foot"" it balances itself on. It is said that the bird was born when the egg-shaped fireball [NAME] had as a Crocalor gained a soul, which also gave [NAME] its Ghost typing. The bird can sometimes be seen pecking at [NAME]'s jaws, supposedly cleaning its teeth.

As shown in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] and its pre-Evolutions are known to sometimes sleep with one eye open. The fiery bird on [NAME]'s head sometimes moves about and even plays pranks on it when [NAME]'s sleep is shallow, a behavior which [NAME] tolerates.

[NAME] has a meddlesome but caring personality. Its singing is gentle, but powerful and full of vitality, capable of soothing the souls of all who hears it. Opponents hearing its singing will feel warm and fulfilled inside, losing their will to battle. [NAME] burns its enemies by unleashing flames that exceed the temperature of 5,400&nbsp;°F (3,000&nbsp;°C). When [NAME] sings, its fire bird transforms into a microphone for [NAME], growing its ""foot"" longer until it reaches the ground. The bird is then powered up by the [NAME]'s singing, growing larger, and flying towards its enemy.

It has light blue eyes, white eyelids, and a light blue, fin-like marking around the outer corner of each eye. It has a white T-shaped marking on its forehead and a small, white V-shape on its chest. Around its shoulders are segmented purple rings and its long thin arms have webbed hands with three fingers. Each finger is tipped with a purple claw. On the front of its lower body is a light blue, fin-like projection with three spikes. It also has light blue fins on top of its head that resemble long, flowing hair.

[NAME]'s main body resides inside a violet shell that resembles a swordfish head when closed. The top half of the shell has a fin with light blue webbing on top and a thin, pointed spine on the front. On each side of the top shell are two C-shaped markings facing each other to form a rough circle. One marking is white and one is light blue, but both are outlined in black. These markings form the ""eye"" of the swordfish. Along the edges of both shell halves are a series of white triangles with black outlines.

As the guardian of Poni Island, [NAME] can freely manipulate water and it gains energy from ocean currents. [NAME] is both respected and feared. To avoid harm to itself in battle, it shrouds its surroundings in a mysterious fog that sends its opponents into a self-destructive trance. The guardian also unleashes this fog as a test for those who seek the special water it can create, which is said to cleanse anything unclean that it touches. Many humans have attempted this trial, including those with ill intent; disgusted by this history, [NAME] does not care much for humans. Despite this, it is willing to help those who prove themselves worthy. As seen in ''Run, Heroes, Run!'', [NAME] has shown to be able to make water clocks out of water and bridge the world of the living with the world of the dead using mist. As stated in ''Memories in the Mist!'', long periods of exposure to this mist can trap people within it forever, specifically targeting those who cannot endure the pain of seeing a deceased loved one again. [NAME] is known to defend its home from the Ultra Beasts. As seen in the ''Revealing the Stuff of Legend!'', [NAME] and the other tapu can transform a Z-Ring into a Z-Power Ring.

Tapu Bulu,787,Land Spirit,"[NAME] is a vaguely bull-like Legendary Pokemon. [NAME] has a bulky, black body with thick arms and no legs. It has blue eyes with an orange line across each iris. Under each eye is a red line divided into three segments with a smaller, white line below that. There is a short white line above each eye. In the middle of its face is what appears to be a golden nose similar to a bull's snout. There is a white ring through the nostrils of the nose. On each side of its face is a thick white line that curves upward at the outer tip. There are red rings around its shoulders and golden, cloven hooves at the end of its arms. Its tail is mostly covered in a golden bell with two thin black rings around the top and a wavy black line around the bottom. A tuft of fur is just visible inside the bell. On top of its head is a pair of curved, black horns. Each horn has a thick yellow marking near the tip and half of a wooden shell attached to it.

[NAME]'s shell is primarily red with white and yellow markings thickly bordered by a muted black. The shell itself resembles a flower or plant when open; when closed, the horns shift to the sides and it takes on the appearance of a bull. The top of each half is slightly thicker than the bottom, which gives the ""bull"" a slightly protruding brow. At the bottom of each half is a white rectangle with a muted black triangle at the bottom. Above the rectangles are two triangular markings; the top triangle slightly overlaps a larger, yellow triangle. Behind and just touching the yellow triangle is a tiny, white rectangle that creates the ""bull's"" eyes. The side has a single, tiny yellow triangle marking.

This guardian of Ula'ula Island is able to command vegetation to grow and change shape to its will. Despite its fearsome power, it is largely inactive, leading some to consider it a lazy Pokemon. It has a peaceful disposition and does not like to cause unnecessary violence, so it rings the bell on its tail to alert others of its presence. However, it is merciless to those who offend it and it is said to have once repelled thieves from its ruins by swinging trees like clubs. The ruined Tapu Village stands as another example of the guardian's wrath. [NAME] is known to defend its home from the Ultra Beasts. As seen in ''Revealing the Stuff of Legend!'', [NAME] and the other tapu can transform a Z-Ring into a Z-Power Ring.

Its body consists mostly of shades of brown: light, tan brown on its forehead, chest, abs, and extremities; dark brown on its nose and triangular ears, as well as under its eyes; and medium, mud-like brown across the rest of its body, including its thick arms and legs. Its mouth, the tip of its nose, and its irises are orange, and its sclerae are white. Each of its upper arms have tan marks resembling bow-ties or butterflies, and it has two, diamond-shaped, tan marks running down its spine. The first, and larger, of the two marks begins around its shoulder blades, and the second, and smaller, mark begins below its rib cage. [NAME] has a thick bush of green, leaf-like hair on its head, which cascades down its back; on its forehead, a single, vine-like hair, which closely resembles a music note, falls between its eyes and curls at the end, which sits to its nose's left side. On its hips on either side, it has green, belt-like adornments resembling four leaves in a row. Similar adornments with two leaf-like parts sit on its each of its shoulders near the clavicles; these adornments appear to be part of its hair when not attacking. On each of its wrists, [NAME] has cuffs that resemble leafy crowns, with the peaks of the crown facing its hands.

[NAME] always carries its signature drum with it on its back, and pulls it out when engaged in battle. This bass drum is crafted from a tree stump, with several thick branch stumps protruding from it, which form both the legs of the bass drum as well as mid and high toms. [NAME] also carries two drumsticks in its cuffs and takes them out to beat its drum.

By drumming, [NAME] can tap into the power of its special tree stump. The roots of the stump follow the direction of its drumming in battle. In a troop of [NAME], the one with the best drumming technique is the leader. This is how [NAME] who challenged each other for leadership usually settles it through a drum battle. [NAME] has a kind and calm disposition, valuing harmony within its group. It is very sensitive towards discord that could threaten the group's harmony, so it keeps a strict watch for such actions. Any offenders who drum up discord will be strictly disciplined by [NAME] until they have learned their lesson. Due to its strong sense of unity, it will ferociously defend its allies from trouble.

It has short arms with three-fingered paws and large hind paws with oval markings on the soles. Its tail is long and thin with an ovoid tip. Its fur is so fine and thin, it can only be seen under a microscope.

[NAME] has shown a playful, childish personality, showing signs of high intelligence, curiosity, shyness, playfulness, and even selflessness. It is said to have the DNA of every single Pokemon contained within its body. This causes many scientists to theorize that [NAME] is the ancestor of all Pokemon. It is an incredibly adaptable species, capable of levitation and teleportation. It can use almost all known moves, regardless of their types. It has also shown the rare power to transform into all known Pokemon. It is capable of making itself invisible at will, so it entirely avoids notice even if it approaches people. As seen on several occasions, it has the ability to create an orb of energy around itself for protection, which can come in many colors, such as green, yellow, and pink.

According to journals found in Kanto's Pokemon Mansion, Mr. Fuji is the one who discovered [NAME] deep in the jungle and coined its name. With other scientists, he managed to gather some of [NAME]'s DNA and used it in his mansion to create a modified clone of it, aiming it to be the most powerful Pokemon of all, which resulted in the birth of the Legendary Pokemon [NAME]two. Since [NAME] can make itself invisible, very few people have seen it, leading some scientists to declare it extinct and most to assume it to be nothing, but a mirage. However, sightings of it are still being reported to this day, confirming its existence. Even though it's rarely seen, it will willingly show itself to a person who is pure of heart and has a strong desire to see it.

According to the ''Pokemon the Series''-related radio drama, ''The Birth of [NAME]two'', [NAME] was discovered by Jessie's mother, Miyamoto, who registered its cry in a forest 20 years before the events of the series. It was worshiped for its protection by ancient people who created a song in its honor and believed it appeared once a year with the rising sun. It wasn't rediscovered until 18 years after Miyamoto met [NAME] by sunrise on the peak of a high mountain. As depicted in the episode ''In the Palms of our Hands!'' it is capable of splitting itself up and transforming into more than one Pokemon at the same time. It was also shown to possess a strong rivalry with its clone, [NAME]two in ''[NAME]two Strikes Back''.

[NAME] is the only known Pokemon capable of using the Z-Move Genesis Supernova.",Psychic,,Psychic,,1.0,0,"[""Psychic""]",868,10,878
Magnemite,81,Magnet,"[NAME] is a seemingly robotic Pokemon that has a gray, spherical metal body, with blue-and-red tipped horseshoe magnets on each side and a single, large eye. It has three Phillips head screws on its body: two near the bottom of its body and the one on top of its head that looks similar to an antenna. The two bottom screws serve no noticeable purpose, although they may be its feet as the Pokedex identifies a footprint similar to that of the screw's head. Even though [NAME] and its evolved forms are mechanical creatures, it is shown in the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''Get Along, Little Pokemon'' that it has emotions and a way of reproducing. In ''The Poke Spokesman'', it exhibited the need to eat, although its main form of nutrition are electrical currents. It is commonly found in locations such as power plants or caves with a strong magnetic field. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, [NAME] has been depicted in carvings discovered at the Ruins of Alph. It has also been present in AZ's retelling of the Kalos war, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years.

The magnetic units on [NAME]'s body generate an electromagnetic field that allows it to defy gravity and can potentially disrupt electrical equipment. The units generate stronger magnetic fields the faster they rotate. [NAME] is not known to be unnecessarily aggressive but they may approach Trainers with little notice. If a wild [NAME] is approached, it may simply flee on rare occasions, as [NAME] does not care for interaction. However, if attacked, it will retaliate with non-damaging moves. In the care of a Trainer, it can be a devoted fighter. However, as seen in the PTS episode ''The Poke Spokesman'', it's shown that it may be deterred unless a strong bond is formed with its Trainer. Should it run out of electricity, [NAME] will fall to the ground. Usually, batteries can help recharge it in order for [NAME] to start moving again.

[NAME] can be attracted to anything emitting electricity or a magnetic field, including gadgets such as a Poketch. In the episode ''Sparks Fly for [NAME]'', it is shown to be attracted to electric Pokemon producing such fields. With modern electrical lines buried underground, [NAME] attacks on power plants have increased. To prevent power outages, these power plants deliberately send out signals [NAME] cannot stand to ward them off. As mentioned in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] is known to sleep airbone by generating electromagnetic waves from its side magnets.There are rare occasions where while [NAME] sleeps and muddles to the direction of its waves, it will loop in the air while sleeping.",Electric,Steel,Electric,Steel,1.0,1,"[""Electric"", ""Steel""]",825,76,901
Pikachu,25,Mouse,"[NAME] is a short, chubby rodent Pokemon. It is covered in yellow fur with two horizontal brown stripes on its back. It has a small mouth, long, pointed ears with black tips, and brown eyes. Each cheek is a red circle that contains a pouch for electricity storage. It has short forearms with five fingers on each paw, and its feet each have three toes. At the base of its lightning bolt-shaped tail is a patch of brown fur. A female will have a V-shaped notch at the end of its tail, which looks like the top of a heart. It is classified as a quadruped, but it has been known to stand and walk on its hind legs; therefore, [NAME] is a facultative biped.

In the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''[NAME]'s Goodbye'', wild [NAME] are shown to live in groups in forested areas. [NAME] communicate amongst themselves using squeaks and tail-shaking as friendly gestures. In ''A Plethora of [NAME]!'', it is shown that Alolan [NAME] are known to greet each other by sniffing one another and rubbing their tails together. Electricity can be used to receive and send messages with each other, as well as with other Electric Pokemon. It raises its tail to check its surroundings and is occasionally struck by lightning in this position. When groups grow, they can inadvertently cause lightning storms. [NAME] forage for Berries, which it roasts with electricity to make them tender enough to eat. A sure sign that [NAME] inhabits a location is patches of burnt grass. In The Electric Tale of [NAME] manga, it is depicted eating and sometimes destroying telephone poles, wires, and other electronic equipment. By occasion, it can get unintentionally swallowed by Cramorant. While startled, it looks for ways to escape from the latter.

[NAME] charges itself while sleeping overnight, though stress and a lack of sleep can affect this. It can release electric discharges of varying intensity. In the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''Sparks Fly for Magnemite'', [NAME] is shown to build up energy in its glands, which it will need to discharge to avoid complications. It is also able to release energy through its tail, which acts as a grounding rod, as well as recharge fellow [NAME] with electric shocks. [NAME] and its evolutionary relatives are related to Pachirisu. As shown in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] is known to generate electricity through its cheeks while sleeping. [NAME] discharges while sleeping due to it dreaming of firing electric shots.

[NAME] and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Volt Tackle. [NAME] is also the only known Pokemon capable of using the Z-Move Catastropika, and the only known Pokemon capable of using the Light Ball item.",Electric,,Electric,,1.0,0,"[""Electric""]",854,9,863
Rayquaza,384,Sky High,"[NAME] is a large, green, serpentine Pokemon that also resembles a missile.

Yellow ring-like symbols run across the length of [NAME]'s body and it has an additional yellow ring on top of its head. [NAME] has two limbs with three-clawed hands, and two long, flat, horn-like structures on its head, with two shorter horns along its jawline. It has small, yellow eyes with black pupils, prominent pink gums, and two discernible fangs in its upper jaw.

[NAME] has a strong and endless desire to do heroic deeds for the Pokemon world. [NAME] is said to be equal to both Groudon and Kyogre. For that reason, it is the only one who can halt the endless battles of the other two super-ancient Pokemon, by overpowering them and forcing both back into their slumber, even in their Primal Forms.. It is also the only one that can restore the order of nature that they've disrupted. [NAME] is said to have lived for hundreds of millions of years in the ozone layer, where it feeds on water and other particles. There, it feeds on meteoroids, which includes Mega Stones and even Minior. It also loves [NAME] Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered it in the past. [NAME] is rarely seen by people; even in flight, its appearance is indistinguishable from that of a meteor. For living in the ozone layer, it can breathe in outer space.

[NAME] possesses some of the strongest attack power out of any Pokemon, and can easily summon cyclones to overwhelm its opponents. It can soar into the sky and drop out into its foes at high speeds, causing huge damage. Thanks to its weather-manipulation powers, it can eliminate weather effects. [NAME] was worshiped by the Draconid people as the savior of the region since ancient times. Thus, they built the Sky Pillar to honor it. Additionally, it can be summoned atop Sky Pillar by multiple Key Stones. In Pokemon Adventures, the Draconids referred to it as their ""Dragon Lord"". It is one of the longest-lived Pokemon species. Inside its body lies an organ that contains the same power as a Mega Stone, which was named the ""mikado organ"" (Japanese: '''ミカドきかん''') by a Devon Corporation scientist.

[NAME] possesses a strong rivalry with Deoxys, an extraterrestrial Pokemon that repeatedly invades its territory, with the two often clashing with each other in space. This is depicted in the movie ''Destiny Deoxys'' and in the games Omega Ruby, Alpha Sapphire, and Masters EX.

Combee,415,Tiny Bee,"[NAME] is a small, flying, insectoid Pokemon. Its body consists of three orange, hexagonal sections that resemble honeycomb cells, arranged with two hexagons on top and the remaining hexagon between and below them. Each hexagon has a round, yellow face with two black, oval eyes and a black, curved mouth. In the middle of their foreheads, the upper two faces each have a single whisker-thin, black antenna with black, oval tips approximately the size of their eyes. They also each have a translucent, rounded-triangle-shaped wing connected to an orange, domed joint on their sides. The backsides of the upper faces are yellow and rounded, as the sides of a sphere. The bottom face is the main thinker of the three, and it is also the only one to have a full, insectoid abdomen. This abdomen is yellow near the tip with a thick, black stripe close to its hexagonal frame. Female [NAME] have red, wedge-shaped spots on the foreheads of their lower faces, just below the point where all three faces meet; male [NAME] have no distinct markings in this area.

Similar to other Pokemon with multiple heads, such as Dugtrio and Dodrio, [NAME]'s trio of faces each have their own consciousness. For example, each face has a different taste in nectar, and [NAME] can fly only when the top two faces coordinate the flapping of their wings. Each [NAME]'s trio of faces has been together since birth.

Unlike bees in real life, the vast majority of [NAME] are male. However, [NAME] are otherwise similar to bees in their social behavior. They are mostly sociable among their own kind, and form groups of about a hundred individuals. They are generally harmless to others, as they tend to flee when threatened. From sunrise to sunset, [NAME] will collect nectar to create Honey wherever they can. Beautifly often provides trouble by driving away any [NAME] that tries to collect near it. Though [NAME] produce Honey for multiple purposes, they usually consume it. Each swarm of [NAME] makes a different flavor of honey. When not gathering nectar, [NAME] will protect their queen Vespiquen. They are very suggestible and will never defy the orders of their queen. When a Vespiquen feels threatened, its [NAME] will not think twice about risking their lives to protect their queen, to the point of aggressively attacking or even killing the threat. [NAME] commonly live in caves and hollow trees of forests and other natural, secluded areas with their queen. [NAME] sleep by creating a hive with other [NAME], locking together into a tessellated wall to feel safe in larger numbers. Teddiursa and Mothim regularly raid [NAME] nests for the Honey they collected.

Prior to Generation V, Honey Gather was [NAME]'s signature Ability.",Bug,Flying,Bug,Flying,1.0,1,"[""Bug"", ""Flying""]",861,76,937
Giratina,487,Renegade,"[NAME] is a large gray draconic Pokemon with three gold half-rings on each side of its long neck. Its head has a gold crown-like object surrounding it with two large horns pointing sideways. A thick black stripe runs vertically along its front with five red horizontal stripes. In its Altered Forme, it has two large black ghostly wings with three red tips on each that can resemble claws. These wings can change shape as if made of a liquid or gas. Its six legs are thick and have golden claws. Two golden half-circles similar to those on its neck are on each side of each leg, resembling shackles. It has a tail with two band-like markings.

According to the myths and legends of the Hisui/Sinnoh region, in the beginning of existence, the Mythical Pokemon Arceus created the eggs in which the Pokemon of antimatter–[NAME], the Pokemon of time–Dialga, and the Pokemon of space–Palkia, hatched from, all three in their Origin Formes. After the Pokemon universe was created, due to [NAME]'s violent nature, Arceus banished it to the Distortion World, a world that lies on the reverse side of the Pokemon world. Since then, [NAME] carried a strong grudge against its creator Arceus and was willing to stand against it with the help of a human named Volo, but after being defeated by a human from another time and fleeing, it would change its ways to protect the universe from threats such as Cyrus, who had a similar goal to its former partner.

[NAME] is highly aggressive and territorial, likely other reasons for its banishment. It has been reported to appear in ancient cemeteries. [NAME] has the power to tear holes in reality, sometimes even creating a space-time rift, being so big and powerful that it can even throw both Dialga and Palkia into a frenzy. This rift might also spread smaller space-time distortions all over the region it was created in, creating Alpha Pokemon and releasing bolts of lightning that throw noble Pokemon into a frenzy. It is also capable of cloaking itself in darkness as it attacks. It generally moves by levitating itself in the air, as opposed to walking on its six legs. [NAME] is said to be equal in strength to its siblings Dialga and Palkia. 

[NAME] is said to have observed the real world silently while in its home dimension. It remains in its Altered Forme while outside of its home dimension. Unlike in the games, Pokemon movies depict [NAME] only opening portals through reflective surfaces. [NAME] also had many different titles throughout the years: ""the banished Pokemon"", ""Arceus's shadow"", ""the Pokemon of Shadows"", and ""the being on the other side of our world"".

Hoopa,720,{{tt|Mischief|Hoopa Confined}},"[NAME] Confined is a light-purple Pokemon with a vaguely humanoid appearance. It has green eyes with yellow sclerae, a yellow ring marking on its forehead, a small, pink dot under each eye, and dark pink hair tied into a short ponytail. On either side of its head is a dark gray horn that curves slightly upward. Its body has a dark pink, V-shaped marking on the chest and a small, golden spike on each shoulder. Its arms are not attached to its body and instead float next to it; each arm has a small golden spike similar to those on its shoulders. It has mitten-like hands and dark pink rings around each wrist. In place of actual legs, it has a wispy tail. [NAME] has three gold rings: a large one around its waist and one hanging freely on each of its horns.

In the past, [NAME]'s true power is said to have been sealed away in the Prison Bottle for the destruction it used to cause, reducing [NAME] to its smaller, weaker form; opening the bottle grants [NAME] its true form once again, but only for three days. In ''[NAME] and the Clash of Ages'', the one who sealed [NAME]'s power in the Prison Bottle was a traveler named Ghris. The rings on [NAME]'s body can warp space and allow it to transport items, humans, and Pokemon by passing them through its hoops. This power allows it to cause mischief and take anything it wants. [NAME] is connected to many strange events because of these mysterious powers. It stores all of its gathered loot in a secret spot only it knows. [NAME] is said to have the power to bend dimensions. It is heavily implied to be the one causing many of the Mirage spots in the Hoenn region. As seen in Masters EX, [NAME] can even bring people and Pokemon from alternate timelines. [NAME] is very fond of foods that have holes in them, especially donuts.(September 12, 2025).  — Pokemon Official Website

[NAME]'s lair is rumored to be located inside an hidden desert oasis. This lair contains many objects and treasures [NAME] obtained over the years, claiming as its own. [NAME]'s lair is believed to contain mountains of gold and silver treasures it stole from ancient kings and wealthy land barons. To the present day, no one has ever found [NAME]'s lair due to how well hidden it is. [NAME] can be very vengeful to those who attempt to manipulate it for its unique power. According to one tale, it punished an organization by transporting their individual objects before moving their headquarter to the middle of the desert. This incident terrified the organization to the point of disbanding.

Yveltal,717,Destruction,"[NAME] is a large Pokemon with both avian and draconic traits. The back of its body is black with white spots along the wings and back; its front, head, and neck are bright red with branching, black lines throughout. It has a pointed, beak-like snout, bright blue eyes, a black, forward-curving horn over each eye, and a thin, antenna-like growth behind each eye. A feathery gray ruff encircles its neck and billows out over its back. [NAME]'s wings each have three spikes along the bottom edge near the body and five large, black claws on the tip. It has small, birdlike legs with gray talons. Each foot has two toes facing forward and one pointing backward. Its tail is similar in structure to its wings, including the five claws on the tip.

[NAME] has the power to absorb life energy by spreading its wings and tailfeathers. According to legend, [NAME] does this in order to power up its own energy. It is highly feared by the ancient people of Kalos because of this. [NAME] is known to appear during a conflict, draining the life energy of any person or Pokemon that it encounters. Upon reaching the end of its lifespan, [NAME] steals the life energy of everything around it, then encases itself in a cocoon and falls into a deep slumber. [NAME] along with Xerneas have the power to transform Evolution stones into Mega Stones as seen with the ultimate weapon's blast shot by AZ 3000 years ago. Both are in charge of taking care of the land in a delicate balance between life and death. [NAME]'s power can be used to power up machines as seen with the ultimate weapon. It can also absorb its target's energy, restoring its vitality as a result. Said attack can also burn the ground it hits in the process. 

As shown in ''Pokemon the Series'', any living creatures drained by [NAME] will turn into petrified stone, though it is unknown whether this action is intentionally malicious or not. As depicted in ''Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction,'' [NAME] can be very vengeful to anyone who disturbs its sleep and will seek to destroy it. Its counterpart Xerneas has the power to cure [NAME]'s victims by filling them with life energy, but as seen in ''The Legend of X, Y, and Z!'', it couldn't undo Aila's case for unknown reasons. Xerneas is also shown capable of calming [NAME] should it get enraged. In ''Sylveon Enchants'', [NAME] was shown making plants wither away by simply touching them. In the Pokemon Adventures manga and in PTS, it has been referred to as ""Y"".

Tapu Koko,785,Land Spirit,"[NAME] is a vaguely rooster-like Legendary Pokemon. [NAME]'s head and torso are black with white markings on its chest, just above its eyes, and on top of its head. Extending from the top of its head is a large, orange plume with bristles along the back. There is a yellow marking covering the top bristle and half of the bristle below it. The bottom of this crest goes all the way to its neck, where it divides its face in half and creates a beak-like nose. It has small, blue eyes with yellow markings behind them. The lower half of its body is orange with four pointed projections: one short spine on the front and two short spines in the back, with one longer spine between them. These spines resemble a bird's tail feathers. Its thin arms have round, yellow structures encircling its shoulders. On each arm is a shell that appears to be half of a bird mask, and its hands end in two large claws to create a beak for the mask.

The mask itself is mostly yellow with black, orange, and white markings. There are three white triangular markings with black edges on the top of each half of the mask, which create diamond shapes when the mask is closed. The 'eyes' consist of a white diamond connected to a slightly larger orange diamond, which is inside a larger yellow diamond. Each of these shapes is edged in black. On each half of its beak is an orange triangle with a white rim. There are wing-shaped structures on each side, toward the back. [NAME] is able to pull the mask together and hide its upper body inside, creating the impression of a stylized rooster.

This Pokemon is called the guardian deity of Melemele Island. It's known for protecting its home, but it is fickle and will not necessarily help people in need. However, it is very curious and may come to play or battle with people or Pokemon that interest it. It is able to store electricity by closing itself inside the shells on its arms. It does this by summoning thunderclouds. It has an explosive temper, but it instantly forgets what enraged it in the first place. Due to this, [NAME] has been referred to as a malevolent deity should it get provoked. It can move lightning-fast in order to confuse enemies that fight it. [NAME] is known to defend its home from the Ultra Beasts. As seen in ''Revealing the Stuff of Legend!'', [NAME] and the other tapu can transform a Z-Ring into a Z-Power Ring. Furthermore, in ''Battling the Beast Within!'', it was shown to have the ability to transport others into Ultra Space when working together with another [NAME].

Ogerpon,1017,Mask,"[NAME] is a predominantly green, humanoid Pokemon. Its green torso is spotted with white flowers and yellow dots, and it is capable of extending prehensile branches and vines of ivy. Its long legs have an outer layer of black, but otherwise appear as if split from a tree trunk: their innermost sides are flat and of a woody ash-brown color. The soles of its two-toed feet are also of this color, and show matching portions of growth rings. Between the toes on each foot, two green leaves sprout, evoking the image of ''hanao'' sandal thongs. Its torso is mostly covered by a large, green, multicolored cloak-like structure that extends from a stem on top of its head. This cloak frames its face with a large, black, thorny vine, the two uppermost thorns resembling horns. The cloak appears prehensile, and its ""sleeves"" serve as [NAME]'s arms, able to grasp and manipulate objects; [NAME] is never seen without the cloak. [NAME] has an orange face, yellow eyes with white, star-shaped pupils and small green leaves at the edges that loosely resemble eyelashes, a three-pointed leaf that serves as hair, small black markings on its eyebrows and cheeks, and two pointed fangs in its upper jaw. Its face is usually hidden behind one of its masks, and in battle, it wields a large, spiky cudgel wrapped in ivy; these tools are stored under its cloak when not in use. [NAME] is a female-only species with no male counterpart.

[NAME] is a very intelligent Pokemon with a playful mischief-loving side. It's full of curiosity about the lives of people and other Pokemon, usually spending time with humans while wearing a mask to blend in with them in Kitakami's Festival of Masks. It is known to often cause trouble, such as by stealing snacks from the village’s food supply or making off with items that caught its eye. It fights by confusing its opponents with its nimble movements and kicks, and it draws type-based energy from its masks, imbuing its cudgel with different elements. [NAME] becomes weaker if its masks are taken away, and its full power can be restored to it by returning its masks. By using any of its masks, [NAME] is capable of Terastallizing itself without the need of a Tera Orb, supposedly due to the masks being made of Tera crystals, just like Tera Orbs. This species is known to have a very long lifespan; one specimen is confirmed to have been alive for hundreds of years. [NAME] is mortal enemies with the Loyal Three and their leader Pecharunt, mainly due to the group's actions towards it in the past. In Kitakami myths, it is described as ""the ogre"".

Torracat,726,Fire Cat,"[NAME] is a quadrupedal, feline Pokemon. Its upper half, which includes its tail, is covered mostly in dark gray fur, while the fur on its lower half is mostly reddish orange. On its back, a stripe of reddish orange fur runs down its spine, with other two smaller horizontal stripes going across it. A similar fur pattern is seen on [NAME]'s face, though now it moreso resembles an upside-down double cross: the vertical stripe extends up from its head, forming a short cowlick, and the lowest horizontal stripes tilt upwards into a V-shape above its eyes, forming its eyebrows. Its eyes have yellow irises and black pupils with a red tint at the bottom and are heavily outlined in black fur. Its ears are pointed up and have light gray fur at the base. It has a short muzzle, a tiny triangular white nose, and tufts of fur sprouting from each of its cheeks, which make up its mane. Its tail is thicker the farther away from the body and ends in several tufts of fur, giving the impression it has blown up. Its forelegs are more developed than its hind legs, capable of bending iron with a single blow. Each paw has three toes, with the front ones being larger and ending on short black claws. On its tail and legs, there are two rings of opposite-colored fur.

Hanging from [NAME]'s neck is a round, bell-like organ, which is yellow with an orange core. This fiery organ is actually [NAME]'s flame sac, which produces the flames it uses to attack; when it does so, the organ sometimes flares with wing-like projections to the sides. The fire bell responds to [NAME]'s emotions, blazing hotter according to its spirits, and rings brightly whenever it spews fire or in the heat of battle. As seen in the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''Exhibition Unmasked!'', its fire bell is also capable of absorbing flames from outside sources and converting them into its own power. In addition, [NAME]'s mane acts as a sensory organ, allowing it to navigate in darkness and sense hidden foes. It is also an indicator of its wellbeing, standing on end when it is in a good mood and lying flat when it is not feeling well.

[NAME] loves to battle, and its relentless onslaught causes others to lose the will to fight. Outside of battle, it sometimes behaves like a spoiled child in front of its Trainer and other Pokemon, showcasing a more affectionate side to itself in comparison to its pre-evolved form. () It, however, still is fickle and fitted with sharp claws, leaving those it has grown to trust marked with scratches.",Fire,,Fire,Normal,0.5,0,"[""Fire"", ""Normal""]",812,76,888
Incineroar,727,Heel,"[NAME] is a humanoid feline Pokemon with a muscular build. It has a short snout with a small red nose, bright green eyes with yellow sclerae, and tiny, pointed ears. Large tufts of red fur extend from its cheeks, and much of its face is also red. The upper half of its muzzle and the top and back of its head are black. A thin red stripe runs vertically along its head to its snout, where it splits into a V-shape over its eyes. Its torso is gray with several black stripes and seems to resemble a wrestler's tank top; the front and back both have a single vertical stripe up the center, crossed by two horizontal lines. Around [NAME]'s waist is a belt formed from flames that somewhat resembles a championship wrestling belt. In the front center is a small, yellow flame shape. The arms, legs, and tail are all red with black stripes forming bands around them. The arms have three stripes, spiky tufts of black fur over the shoulders, and large five-fingered hands with white claws and a single light red pad on the palm. Its legs have only two stripes and simple three-toed paws, and the tail has one stripe and a tuft of spiky black fur around the tip.

[NAME]'s flame belt is produced from within its body and bursts from its navel and waist as its fighting spirit rises. In addition to spewing fire from its navel, it uses ferocious kicks and punches. [NAME] is an expert on no-holds-barred battles. The flames from its navel can reach a temperature of up to 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit. This Pokemon disregards the safety of its opponents and on-lookers, sometimes striking the opposing Trainer with attacks. [NAME] usually attacks first by unleashing both ferocious punches and flinging furious kick combos and then finishing the opponent by spewing fire from its navel. It is a violent Pokemon with rough, aggressive, and egotistical behavior. It will sometimes ignore its Trainer's orders when it is not in the mood to listen. Despite this, it finds fighting unworthy opponents boring and gets motivated to fight a challenging one. Weak or injured opponents also cause them to lose the desire to fight, which others sometimes use to their advantage. 

It also values the attention of the crowd as [NAME]'s spirit goes up while the crowd is excited or falters when the crowd is bored. When [NAME]'s fighting spirit rises, so does the temperature around its navel waist. While it tends to act like a heel, [NAME] is very happy internally when receiving the admiration of children or young Pokemon. It is also willing to help out children and small Pokemon, further showing its hidden soft side.

In Generation VII, Darkest Lariat was its signature move.

Tapu Lele,786,Land Spirit,"[NAME] is a vaguely butterfly-like Legendary Pokemon. [NAME] has a black upper body and head with a few small white markings. Its eyes are blue with a pink line through the middle of each iris. Below each eye is a curved white line and above each is a curved pink line separated into three segments. On its upper body is another, thicker curved white line. Its thin arms have digitless hands and puffy pink bracelets on each wrist. On top of its head is a mass of dark pink, tentacle-like hair. Two longer strands of hair frame its face. Encasing its dark pink lower body and on top of its head is a shell resembling an insect.

[NAME]'s shell is primarily light pink. The portion on top of its head is conical with a white diamond marking in the center and a white half-diamond marking below that. Both diamond shapes are framed in black. The shell around its lower body mirrors these diamond markings and has an additional half-diamond on the back. On each side is a hexagon marking consisting of five dark pink triangles and one light pink triangle all outlined in black. These resemble the compound eyes of many insects. There are also projections on the back of the shell that resemble butterfly wings and a small black bump on the bottom similar to a curled proboscis. When closed, the shell resembles a bug's head with small wings. [NAME]'s strength is derived from the vital energy stored within its shell.

The people of Akala Island worship [NAME] as their guardian deity. It is known to scatter glowing scales, which affect others by stimulating and healing their bodies; however, these scales are also dangerous if too many are touched at once. [NAME] is sometimes described as cruel for the way it weakens others as it scatters its scales for its own amusement. This indifferent disposition has earned [NAME] the moniker ""nature incarnate"". An old legend recounts that [NAME] ended a war between Alola's islands by healing the tired warriors with its scales, but some accounts point to a more disturbing truth behind this story. If [NAME] finds itself at a disadvantage during battle, it focuses on avoiding an outright loss rather than seeking a decisive victory. It is said to gain energy from the scent of flowers. [NAME] is known to defend its home from the Ultra Beasts. As seen in ''Revealing the Stuff of Legend!'', [NAME] and the other tapu can transform a Z-Ring into a Z-Power Ring.

[NAME] and the other guardian deities are the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Nature's Madness. They are also the only known Pokemon capable of using the Z-Move Guardian of Alola.",Psychic,Fairy,Psychic,Fairy,1.0,1,"[""Psychic"", ""Fairy""]",822,78,900
Silvally,773,Synthetic,"[NAME] is a quadrupedal, chimeric Pokemon with traits from a variety of creatures, with an appearance nearly identical to its pre-Evolution, Type: Null. It has a mammalian head with mechanical parts. Covering most of its head and neck is a thick, silver mane that extends down over its chest. Its blunt snout is metallic on the bridge of its nose and upper jaw. [NAME] has a triangular black nose framed by three red lines, pointed ears with bright pink and black insides, one visible fang on each side of its lower jaw, and a slight overbite. Its eyes are bright silver, have no visible pupils, and appear to be surrounded by an empty, black space. On each side of its head is a circular, metallic drive, with a white circle crossed by a metal line. On top of its head is a large, axe-like fur or feather crest. The tip of the crest has a hooked, metallic piece, while the back has three white feathers. [NAME]'s lower body is mostly covered in short, black fur. The lower half of each front leg is insectoid and green with spikes along the back, while the rear legs have thick purple scales on the flanks, shins, and the top of the foot. All four of its feet have three toes, but in the front two toes face forward and one backward. Additionally, the hind paws have a short, gray claw on the back of the ankle. Its fishlike tail consists of two dark blue spines with a white fin stretched between them. The top spine has a line of short, gray spikes.
Once Type: Null finds a trusted partner and forms a powerful bond with them, it gains the strength and willpower needed to destroy its control mask and finally evolve into its original form, [NAME]. After its Evolution, it reactivates its RKS System, gaining the ability to change its type through the Memories created by the Aether Foundation; this ability was based on the powers of a certain Pokemon depicted in myths. Additionally, [NAME]'s speed and senses are increased due to Evolution. It was created as part of the beast killer project as an ""Anti-UB Fighting life-form"", however, the project was deemed a failure and a control helmet was built to seal away its power, turning it into Type: Null. It reverts back to its natural, wild temperament, but it is still extremely loyal to its Trainer, and it will even risk its own life in its partner's defense. Gladion was the one who coined [NAME]’s name, but when it was created, it was named as ""Type: Full"" due to its ability to change between all types. Being created to hunt down Ultra Beasts, as seen in SM and Pokemon Adventures, [NAME] can feel the appearance of Ultra Beasts and the opening of Ultra Wormholes. 

[NAME] is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Multi-Attack. Additionally, [NAME] is the only known Pokemon that can have RKS System as an Ability.",Normal,,Normal,,1.0,0,"[""Normal""]",894,9,903
Palkia,484,Spatial,"[NAME] is a light-purple, theropod-like Pokemon with stripes and markings of a darker shade and gray underarms and waist. It has round purple-striped plates on its shoulder area, where two pink pearl-like crystals lie encrusted with a gray rim encircling them, and fin-like wings on its back. [NAME]'s arms have extended formations resembling gauntlets and a purple band around each wrist. [NAME] has a long neck that is normally bent, a pointed white crest on the top of its head that extends to its wings, two strong horn-like tusks on the sides of its jaw, and a powerful tail. It has faint cracks along its legs and tail.

According to the myths and legends of the Hisui/Sinnoh region, in the beginning of existence, the Mythical Pokemon Arceus created eggs in which the Pokemon of space–[NAME], the Pokemon of time–Dialga, and the Pokemon of antimatter–Giratina, hatched from, all three in their Origin Formes. After the Pokemon universe was created, [NAME] retreated into its own dimension, where it has lived ever since. It was revered and feared as a deity in the past, being worshipped by the Pearl Clan, who mistook it for Arceus and referred to it as ""almighty Sinnoh"". [NAME] is capable of speaking human language via telepathy, as seen when it communicates through the leader of the Pearl Clan, Irida. [NAME] and Dialga may be also thrown into a frenzy by powerful space-time rifts created by Giratina. Both can also control and spread the space-time distortions from Giratina's rift, which create alpha Pokemon and cause noble Pokemon to become frenzied through lightning bolts that come out of these distortions.

[NAME] has power over space: it can warp space and travel to faraway places as well as alternate dimensions and parallel timelines. Additionally, it is capable of rending its targets along with the space around it. It even has the power to destroy and create an entire universe, either by itself or with Dialga's aid. As seen in JN, [NAME] can open and close dimensional portals to alternate universes. It is said that the birth of [NAME] was what caused the walls of the world to disappear, creating a sky that spans for infinity. It is also stated that space becomes more stable with its every breath. [NAME] usually travels by levitating. Since [NAME] primarily resides in a different dimension, its behavior is nearly impossible to study. The dimension [NAME] lives in is said to be in shreds like ribbons. In the anime,  it has been shown to be very protective of its home, and as a result, tends to have violent conflicts with Dialga when their dimensions intersect. [NAME] is capable of travelling by creating a large yellow sphere from its two pearls, then using it to fly very fast, as seen in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.

Spiritomb,442,Forbidden,"[NAME] is a ghostly purple Pokemon attached to a stone. Although lacking a physical body, [NAME] projects its appearance out of a small rock called the Odd Keystone. The rock is trapezoidal in shape and has two small dots. There is a fissure running down the middle, splitting in two near the bottom. The crack in combination with the two dots appears to form a frowning face. [NAME]'s projected appearance is an ethereal composition of swirling purple energy of an unknown kind. Its face is set in the middle of the purple, and contains green, crescent eyes that are connected to its jagged mouth. Its pupils are composed of a spiral and it is sometimes only seen with one. Swirling around its face are green orbs with yellow centers.

[NAME] is formed by a collection of 108 spirits, some of which are ill-natured. This collection of spirits is known for its misdeeds; thus, as punishment, the spirits were trapped to its Odd Keystone by a traveler using a mysterious spell. Several Pokedex entries state that [NAME] was sealed roughly 500 years before the present time. The Pokemon lays curses with its wicked thoughts. It will lash out at anyone with little thought, often exercising short-sightedness in its pursuit of vengeance. It is rarely encountered in the wild. In most media, [NAME] moves its body primarily through levitation; though in the core series games, it can only appear to do so through dragging the Odd Keystone across the ground.

Papers found within Sea Mauville in Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire state that it was donated from the Oreburgh Mine, suggesting that several Odd Keystones meant to contain [NAME] can be found in the Underground of Sinnoh. Professor Cozmo's father, Raizoh, was responsible for misplacing it when working on the ship.''""The file folder holds a stack of ragged papers.<br> Official Statem— of Apolog— <br> I, —izo— Co—mo, am respon— for the los— of the Odd Keystone dona—d...by the Oreb—gh Mine...""''

In Pokemon Legends: Arceus, [NAME]'s 108 spirits appear in the form of Wisps, small purple entities scattered across the Hisui region after a seal was broken. When 107 Wisps have been taken to a large Odd Keystone shrine at the Crimson Mirelands' Shrouded Ruins as per Vessa's request, she will provide the player with the final Wisp and disappear, with a wild [NAME] appearing shortly afterwards.

As depicted in ''The Keystone Pops!'', [NAME] can be just as aggressive and destructive as the spirits that it is composed of. ''The Spectral Express!'' also revealed that anyone possessed by one of [NAME]'s spirits will start to cause misdeeds, and their face will eventually start to resemble [NAME]. Losing one of these spirits will cause [NAME] to go on an uncontrollable rampage until the lost spirit is returned.",Ghost,Dark,Ghost,Dark,1.0,1,"[""Ghost"", ""Dark""]",891,76,967
Mimikyu,778,Disguise,"[NAME] is a small Pokemon whose body is almost entirely hidden under an old rag. Its small size makes it one of the shortest Ghost types. Its eyes are beady black through the holes in the body of its disguise however, as seen in the animated series, its eyes are actually purple. Fringe of an amorphous foot or lower body is visible under the hem as well. Occasionally, it will also extend a long, black claw-like appendage from under its rag. When angered, its eyes will glow yellow. The veil itself resembles a Pikachu. The cloth is yellow with black-tipped ears. The Pikachu face appears to be drawn with crayons, consisting of black eyes, red cheeks, and a squiggly black mouth. The rag's head is hollow and can be used to store objects. [NAME] also carries a small stick resembling a lightning bolt to create a tail for its costume. When its disguise is damaged, the costume's head droops limply backward, revealing [NAME]'s ruse. Larger rips in the costume are accompanied by shadowy vapors pouring out from whatever is hidden within.

A lonely Pokemon, [NAME] is always covered by its disguise. It is unknown what [NAME]'s true appearance looks like. However, glimpses of it are seen, such as its claw, its underside, and its eyes. Since this Pokemon is weakened by sunlight, it is rumored that the veil is used for protection. It is believed that seeing its true form will cause a mysterious illness or even a painful death. Because of this, [NAME] will become agitated and violently stop anyone from attempting to look underneath its rag. 

[NAME]'s disguise is modeled after Pikachu because of the popularity of Pikachu-styled merchandise, thinking that its disguise would allow it to make friends with people. It uses the disguise to bond more with humans and other Pokemon. Unfortunately, this attempt makes its disguise look more creepy. Until recent times, [NAME] was initially thought by humans to be just a ghost wearing a cloth. As mentioned in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] mimics Pikachu to the point it even sleeps similar to it. Its relationship to Pikachu can vary between individuals and canons, with some being antagonistic, as seen in SM, or can be friendly, as shown in the short, ''A [NAME] Bedtime Story''.

A special [NAME] in Alola acts as the Totem Pokemon for Acerola's trial in an abandoned Thrifty Megamart. This [NAME] possesses Z-Power, an energy that originates from Ultra Wormholes and takes the form of a golden, flaring aura. The reward for defeating Totem [NAME] and completing the trial is a Ghostium Z.

[NAME] is the only known Pokemon capable of using the Z-Move Let's Snuggle Forever. It is also the only known Pokemon that can have Disguise as its Ability.

[NAME]'s Pokedex data records its height without its disguise. Its height with its disguise in Disguised Form is similar to Pikachu.

Shellos,422,Sea Slug,"[NAME] is a sea slug-like Pokemon whose appearance changes depending on which part of the sea it is found in. Both forms have amorphous, slug-like bodies, black oval-shaped eyes with yellow outlines, minuscule, dot-shaped noses, and wide yellow lips. Like real-world sea slugs, they have mantles covering the top halves of their bodies. These mantles are outlined in yellow, similar to their eyes. Unlike real sea slugs, however, they have bulbous heads and four small feet rather than one large foot.

The West Sea form's underside is white, and its mantle is pink, with several small spike-like protrusions on its back. On its head is a ring of pink, fleshy knobs resembling the gills of a nudibranch. West Sea [NAME]' appearance is theorized to have been influenced by warm ocean waters.

The East Sea form, meanwhile, sports a green underside and a turquoise mantle. Two yellow-lined, flap-like protrusions, resembling cerata, are present along its back. On its head are two white-tipped tentacles resembling rhinophores that extend away from its face. East Sea [NAME]'s appearance is theorized to have been influenced by cold ocean waters.

[NAME] lives along seashores; its color becomes more vibrant the better quality of the waters it lives in. It is also believed that [NAME]'s diet, which consists of plankton, also influences its form, though this has yet to be proven. The physical differences between both forms appear largely cosmetic; no significant changes in capabilities have been observed. While it can travel onto land, it can only stay on the shore for a limited time before its skin dries out. When [NAME]' squishy body is pressed or squeezed, or when [NAME] senses imminent danger, a mysterious purple fluid — theorized to be a kind of stress-induced greasy sweat — will ooze out of its body. This fluid is its defense mechanism against enemies; although harmless, it is very sticky and hard to wash off. [NAME] has a friendly disposition and is said to have great regenerative capabilities. In the animated series, West Sea [NAME] can extend their necks to incredible lengths. It is unknown if the East Sea form can do this as well.

This species once had a shell on its back long ago and is considered a close relative to Pokemon such as Shellder. The Nurse Joy featured in ''Gateway to Ruin!'' revealed Mount Coronet's formation led to an allopatric speciation event, in which the original population of [NAME] was separated into two. As a result, [NAME]'s color and other physical aspects began to vary due to environmental differences and population isolation over time. The two forms are still able to interbreed; the child normally takes the mother's form but takes the father's if bred with a Ditto. Recently, East Sea [NAME]' population has been declining, while West Sea [NAME] has become more abundant than before.",Water,,Water,,1.0,0,"[""Water""]",877,73,950
Kyurem,646,Boundary,"[NAME] is a gray and blue, bipedal Pokemon of indefinable but seemingly draconic basis. [NAME] has a blue head and snout and has yellow eyes without pupils, a pair of pointed light bluish horns on its head, and a yellow crest on its skull that is bioluminescent. Three pointed teeth jut out the bottom of either side of its jaws, which are frozen shut by the ice covering its head. Its long, gray neck has lines running around its whole body, legs, arms, and tail. It has two arms, each with two claws, and each arm is joined by its oddly-shaped, blue ice wings. Each wing has two spikes which are bioluminescent. If its wings are broken, gray tendril-like appendages are revealed on [NAME]'s back. The right side of its body seems to be damaged in some way, as the wing and horn on its head on that side are shorter; the right side of its head also has a spiked edge near its jaw hinge that is absent from its left. Its legs are somewhat slender and have three sharp ice-like claws on each enormous foot. Its tail has three blue conical spikes on its tip, and appears to be some sort of propulsion device or a container of energy; exactly what it is based on is unclear, but it may be a damaged turbine.

[NAME] generates powerful, freezing energy inside itself, but its body becomes frozen when the energy leaks out. It appears that this Pokemon uses its ice powers to freeze its own body in order to stabilize its cellular structure. It is said to have a power that exceeds that of Reshiram and Zekrom, however, this power is kept at bay by the extreme cold. [NAME] can use its tendril-like appendages to transform Reshiram and Zekrom back into their respective Dragon Stones and even absofuse with them while they're in that state. In Pokemon Adventures, similarly to Reshiram and Zekrom, [NAME] is somehow capable of flying even with its frozen wings. According to the Village of Dragons's Elder in ''[NAME] VS. The Sword of Justice'', [NAME] is considered one of the strongest Dragon Pokemon in the world. [NAME] is powerful enough to cover Opelucid City and even the entire Unova region in ice. [NAME] loves [NAME] Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered it in the past.

According to an old legend in Lacunosa Town, [NAME] is an extraterrestrial Pokemon that crashlanded on the planet inside either an icy meteor or a Dragon Stone, creating the Giant Chasm. This same legend describes [NAME] as hostile towards Pokemon and humans, due to the fact it supposedly devoured them if they were found outside of Lacunosa Town during the night. However, according to another old legend told by Drayden, [NAME] was created by the leftovers of the single powerful Dragon Pokemon owned by the twin heroes of Unova after it split up into Reshiram and Zekrom. Its true origin is unknown.

Darkrai,491,Pitch-Black,"[NAME] is a black, shadow-like Pokemon. It has a small head with a white fog-like ghostly plume billowing from its head covering one of its bright blue eyes, with the portion on its face resembling hair. It also has a red spiky growth around its neck. It has skinny arms and long black tatters hanging from its shoulders. It also has black, claw-like hands. It has the slight appearance of an hourglass figure and appears to be wearing an old, ripped cloak. It normally does not have any sort of legs, but it is able to extend stilt-like appendages in their place. In self-defense, [NAME] can retract its head and white ""plume"" into the pit atop its torso fringed by the aforementioned red growth.

[NAME] is known to ""inhabit"" dreams and causes the target to have unending nightmares, which can be stopped if exposed to a Lunar Feather from Cresselia. However, the ""unleashing of nightmares"" is actually a defense mechanism, instead of an intentionally malicious act. [NAME] is capable of flying at high speeds, and it can become a shadow in order to escape danger or contact with humans. It is also capable of some human speech, and can manifest dark energy for offensive purposes. However, in ''The Rise of [NAME]'', it was shown that its power was weaker than that of Dialga and Palkia. Its relationship to its counterpart, Cresselia, can vary between individuals and canons, with some being antagonistic, as seen ''Sleepless In Pre-Battle!'' and Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time, Darkness, and Sky, or cooperative, as seen in ''Nightfall? Nightmares!'' and ''A Midsummer Night's Light!''. As seen in ''Sleepless In Pre-Battle!'', [NAME] does not only cause nightmares; it is also attracted to them. It can also go around objects it is attracted to several times, as seen in the mentioned episode and Pokemon Ranger: Shadows of Almia. Shadows of Almia also reveal [NAME] can use an ability called ''Dark Power'' to either trap humans or Pokemon in a ''Dark Void'' dimension of total darkness or teleport them to another location. 

[NAME] is said to be active on nights of the new moon. [NAME] possibly feeds off dreams, characterized by its association with never-ending nightmares. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, [NAME] has attempted to use Dark Void while it is asleep. It is theorized that [NAME] performs this move because it cannot contain its overflowing power. [NAME]  has three different sleep styles it sleeps in: ''Floaty Arms-Crossed Sleep'', ''Floaty-Stance Sleep'', and ''Dark Void Sleep''. [NAME] can be lured through a combination of Event Drowsy Power and Cresselia. The Eureka Seed can bring out the full power of [NAME]. [NAME] has been observed slumbering during the day of New Moon.

Minior,774,Meteor,"[NAME] is a spherical Pokemon with two forms: one form with a rocky outer coating and the other with its core exposed. When it sheds its rocky coating, its exposed core form is both the lightest Rock and Flying Pokemon. Both of its forms tie with Carbink and Dwebble as the shortest Rock.

In its Meteor Form, [NAME] resembles a modestly sized rock. Its rocky exterior is formed by four large plates separated by two large cracks. The cracks encircle its body both horizontally and vertically. Five white spikes extend just above the rocky surface, giving it a star shape. Two large, black spots on its front resemble eyes, and there is a third spot in the center of its back. Rings of dark brown triangles surround the holes its spikes protrude from and the spot on its back, pointing outward. One of the triangles surrounding the spot on its back is replaced with a small, brown dot. The eyespots have a half-ring of triangles resembling eyelashes. One eye has a small, brown dot in the corner. Even while apparently at rest, [NAME] tends to spin slowly in place.

When its core is exposed, [NAME] loses its rocky shell. The core is a bright, pastel color. Depending on the color of debris and food it absorbed and ate while in the stratosphere, [NAME]'s core can be Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, or Violet. A handful of darker triangles are also visible on its body in random places. [NAME]'s eyes and mouth are formed from energy that floats in front of its body like a two-dimensional mask. The eyes are two large swirls and the mouth is a smaller line. Its face tends to stay level regardless of how [NAME] spins the rest of its body. The colors of [NAME]'s forms are determined by the composition of the dust it consumes.

[NAME] forms in the stratosphere from an aggregation of mutated nanoparticles, where it absorbs particulate matter from which it builds its core and shell. When touched in Meteor Form, [NAME] will react when touched or called to, it is unknown if these responses indicate its consciousness. Eventually, this process makes it too heavy and it falls towards the surface of the planet. When its shell breaks from landing, [NAME] becomes lighter and capable of attacking quickly. However, it cannot survive for long with its core exposed, and will eventually die if not placed inside a Poke Ball quickly enough. Despite this, many fallen [NAME] will attempt to return to space, sadly being unable to return to space. Despite their wish to return home, all they can do is fade away without their shells. The cute, pastel coloring of [NAME]'s core often inspires designers to use it as a motif for clothing and accessories. While in the ozone layer, it serves as food to stronger Pokemon such as Rayquaza. [NAME]'s diet consists of eating dust. Places where [NAME] falls are few, Alola being one of them.

Magneton,82,Magnet,"[NAME] is a robot-like Pokemon, the result of three Magnemite becoming linked together by a strong magnetic force, although a single Magnemite can evolve by itself when there are no other Magnemite in the vicinity. Each individual Magnemite has a gray spherical body with a single eye, and a gray and red-and-blue tipped horseshoe magnet on each side. The topmost Magnemite has three Phillips head screws on its body, while the others appear to have only two. The three Magnemite that [NAME] consists of can be linked in several ways. [NAME] is most commonly seen as one Magnemite on top, and two Magnemite linked by the screws on the bottom, forming a triangle. In some cases, commonly seen in 3D games such as Snap, the Magnemite will not be connected at all, remain in a triangular formation at rest, and are able to freely move within each other's vicinity to form other patterns. In this case, all three Magnemite have three screws. The magnetic forces that hold the three Magnemite together are powerful enough to dry up all moisture and raise the temperature by 3.6&nbsp;°F (2&nbsp;°C) within a radius of 3,300 feet (one kilometer). It can also be disruptive to electronic devices and induce earaches. It uses powerful radio waves to help it study the surrounding area.

[NAME]'s anti-gravitational powers enable it to fly through the air. Being composed of three Magnemite, it is about three times as powerful electrically, though not three times as intelligent. Even though [NAME] is a mechanical creature, it still needs to eat. As seen in the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''The Poke Spokesman'', food for [NAME] consists of electrical currents. It is usually found in rough terrain, often near power plants. 

When sunspots flare up, [NAME] tends to appear more often, presumably due to the changes in the sun's magnetic field. When rain clouds form, it also gathers in high areas prone to lightning strikes. As seen in the eleventh chapter of Pokemon Adventures, it possesses the ability to form its electricity into both platforms and barriers. As seen in the HZ episode ''The Future I Choose'', it can cause interference with phone and internet signals. In ''An Unexpected Picnic!'', a herd of [NAME] produced an EMP that could destroy computer software. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, carvings depicting [NAME] have been discovered at the Ruins of Alph. One was shown in the Pokemon Generations episode ''The Redemption'' in a flashback to the great war of Kalos, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years. Additionally, Sandy Shocks bears a strong resemblance to [NAME]. It is believed to be an ancient [NAME] that was alive 10,000 years ago. As mentioned in Pokemon Sleep, [NAME] is known to sleep with its three linked Magnemite either stuck together or drifting apart by a strong magnetic force. It is theoried that its magnetism is unstable while [NAME] sleeps.",Electric,Steel,Electric,Steel,1.0,1,"[""Electric"", ""Steel""]",911,76,987
Dialga,483,Temporal,"[NAME] is a dark-blue, sauropod-like Pokemon with some gray metallic portions and light blue stripes. It has a chest plate on its torso, which has a deep blue diamond-like crystal embedded in the center. [NAME] has a five-spiked fin-like structure on its back similar to a gear, three spines on the back of its neck, and a crest on its head, resembling a dinosaur. The crest somewhat resembles the shape of a sundial's rod. It also has two structures on the sides of its head that extend outward and resemble horns and fangs. It has three claws on each foot, of the same metallic look as its chest plate. 

According to the myths and legends of the Hisui/Sinnoh region, in the beginning of existence, the Mythical Pokemon Arceus created eggs in which the Pokemon of time–[NAME], the Pokemon of space–Palkia, and the Pokemon of antimatter–Giratina, hatched from, all three in their Origin Formes. After the Pokemon universe was created, [NAME] retreated into its own dimension, where it has lived since. It was revered and feared as a deity in the past, being worshipped by the Diamond Clan, who mistook it for Arceus and referred to it as ""almighty Sinnoh"". [NAME] is capable of speaking human language via telepathy, as seen when it communicates through the leader of the Diamond Clan, Adaman. [NAME] and Palkia may be also thrown into a frenzy by powerful space-time rifts created by Giratina. Both can also control and spread the space-time distortions from Giratina's rift, which create alpha Pokemon and cause noble Pokemon to become frenzied through lightning bolts that come out of these distortions. 

[NAME] has the power to control time: it can warp time by either speeding it up, slowing it down, reversing it, or stopping it altogether. It can also travel through time to visit the past, present, and future. Additionally, it is capable of blasting its targets with power that distorts time itself. It also has the power to destroy and create an entire universe, either by itself or with Palkia's aid. As shown in JN, [NAME]'s temporal powers possess the ability to devolve anything or anyone against their will, including Pokemon, people, and plant life. It can reverse these effects as well. It is said that time started moving when [NAME] was born and will continue flowing as long as its heart beats. [NAME] usually travels by levitating. Since [NAME] primarily resides in a different dimension, its behavior is nearly impossible to study. In the dimension where [NAME] lives in, time is said to be constantly moving in different directions and speeds. In the anime, it has been shown to be very protective of its home, and as a result, tends to have violent conflicts with Palkia when their dimensions intersect. The fin-like structure on its back is shaped radiating outwards and can be used to focus the flow of time, as seen in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.

Reshiram,643,Vast White,"[NAME] is a white, bipedal Pokemon with draconic, avian, and mammalian traits. A long, voluminous wispy mane streams out from the upper side of the snout and outwards from its head. The top of this mane is adorned with two protrusions resembling ears. [NAME]'s face is fringed with spiky features, and it has a small, pointed extension below the chin. Its eyes have blue irises and black pupils. There are two pairs of pointed teeth visible when its mouth is open, one in the upper jaw and one in the lower. [NAME] has a long and slender neck, with a fluffy, collar-like protrusion jutting out of two gray, glass-like neckbands. Its arms begin slender and arm-like but then flare into a more wing-like appearance, sporting four claws resembling hands on the leading edge. There are plates at the back of [NAME]'s ""hands"" that sport a similar color to its neck rings. [NAME] has a feathered or furry feature on its chest, with the lower portion protruding outwards to a point. Long feather-like protrusions jut out of its thighs. On its feet are large gray claws, three at the front and one positioned at the back, resembling high heels. [NAME]'s tail is a mass of plume and ribbon-like extensions, surrounded by two large bands, similar to the ones around its neck. When its emotions surge, it enters Overdrive mode, and its tail lights up with a fiery glow.
[NAME] has a jet engine-like tail, which it uses to accelerate itself when flying at high speeds. It can send flames from its tail into the air to incinerate everything around it. By flaring its tail, [NAME] can move the world's atmosphere and change the weather. This tail generator is also activated when influenced by either Zekrom's signature moves, which in turn powers up [NAME]'s. [NAME] loves [NAME] Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered it in the past.

In Unovan mythology, [NAME] was created from a single Dragon Pokemon owned by the twin heroes when it split into two: [NAME] and Zekrom. It sided with the older brother who sought the truth; as a result, it firmly believes in truth. [NAME] is said to be Zekrom's equal in battle, meaning neither of the two dragons can truly defeat the other. It is powerful enough to destroy the Unova region with its intense, enveloping flames. [NAME] will transform into the Light Stone should its body get destroyed or when attacked by Kyurem's tendril-like appendages. It can willingly transform back from said stone when awakened by a hero who believes in truth. According to one myth, [NAME] was said to burn down kingdoms of people who ignore truth due to being consumed by greed.

Ditto,132,Transform,"In its natural state, [NAME] is a light-purple or pink blob-like Pokemon with vestigial facial features. It is often referred to as amorphous, but has a relatively consistent appearance in official artwork, including two small nubs on its ""head"", a few soft lumps at its base, and two pseudopod-like protrusions in place of arms. The face consists of beady eyes and a simple mouth; almost always pulled into a smile.

[NAME] bears a variety of unusual and often entirely unique traits that set it apart from every other Pokemon. It is capable of transforming into an exact replica of any physical object or living creature, including its form and properties. Each [NAME] has its own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to transforming; being unable to remain transformed while laughing and getting details of its transformation wrong if based on memory being apparently universal. The Bandai Pokemon Carddass Cards depict [NAME] being able to transform separate sections of its body into parts from multiple Pokemon at once. Similarly, in Pokemon Pokopia, [NAME] can transform parts of its body even while transformed as a human, such as transforming its arms into Bulbasaur's vines to use Leafage. In the ''Pokemon the Series'' episodes ''[NAME]'s Mysterious Mansion'' and ''Deceiving Appearances!'', as well as in the TCG and some spin-off games, it is shown that occasionally [NAME] cannot change its face during transformation; this trait has become synonymous with the species, despite being incongruous with their depiction in the core series games. While its transformation ability allows it to get along with almost anything, it does not get along with its own kind, which it will quickly (and generally fruitlessly) attempt to transform into. 

While [NAME] can transform into a human, it cannot mimic human speech. It transforms into a rock when sleeping to avoid being attacked. As mentioned in Sleep, [NAME] is known to sleep while still transformed into either a rock or Pokemon. On very rare occasions, a sleeping [NAME] will transform back to normal when it is relaxed. In The Indigo Disk, various [NAME] Blocks can be found as objectives in Blueberry Quests throughout the Terarium, where [NAME] will seemingly transform into one of the many cubes with rounded edges that make up many of the structures of the Terarium. Despite being milestones for the player to obtain, and not actually obtainable themselves, they can still be Shiny.

[NAME] is never far from civilization or people, and is the only Pokemon capable of using the Metal Powder and Quick Powder items. It is also the only known Pokemon that can have Imposter as an Ability. ",Normal,,Normal,,1.0,0,"[""Normal""]",818,9,827
Xerneas,716,Life,"[NAME] is a quadrupedal, stag-like Pokemon with four pairs of antlers. Its coloration varies slightly depending on whether it is in Active Mode or Neutral Mode. Regardless of mode, its main body is always black with a blue stripe down its back and a short, bushy tail. Starting at its knees there is a blade-like trim around each leg, which forms a point under each hoof. There is an upside-down, V-shaped marking on its chest in the same color as the trim on its legs. Its head and neck are blue, and there are two large, tufts that extend onto its chest and curve upward. Its first pair of antlers extends onto its head and curves around the underside of its eyes. The eyes are black with X-shaped pupils. There is a short marking on top of its snout and an upward curving horn on each side of its head in place of ears.

In Active Mode, its markings, antlers, and trim on its legs are pale gold. Its antlers have branches and bumps in many colors and there are multicolored spots on its back. [NAME] assumes this Mode during battle or when using its power. [NAME] is at full power when in Active Mode.

In Neutral Mode, its markings and antlers are instead pale blue and the embellishments on its antlers and spots on its back are a darker blue. [NAME] assumes Neutral Mode when not battling and traveling. This remains until it needs to use Active Mode.

[NAME] has the power to share eternal life. This occurs when the horns on its head shine in seven colors. [NAME] can use its life energy to create vast forests and restore life to them. It can infuse both humans and Pokemon with energy and vitality. Because of this, [NAME] is highly respected by the ancient people of Kalos for its role in giving life. [NAME] is also known to be able to speak through telepathy. According to legend, [NAME] is known to have rescued wounded Pokemon during an ancient war. [NAME] and Yveltal have the power to transform Evolution stones into Mega Stones as seen with the ultimate weapon's blast shot by AZ 3000 years ago. Both are in charge of taking care of the land in a delicate balance between life and death. [NAME]'s power can also be used to power up machines such as the ultimate weapon. It can also absorb the energy around itself, sharply strengthening itself as a result through rainbow-colored lights.

As seen in ''Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction'', if it exhausts too much life energy, it transforms into a tree and sleeps for 1,000 years. [NAME] has the power to revive those who have been petrified by Yveltal. However, as seen in ''The Legend of X, Y, and Z!'', it couldn't undo Aila's case for unknown reasons. It was also shown capable of calming Yveltal should it get enraged. In ''Sylveon Enchants'', [NAME] was shown making plants grow by simply touching them. In the Pokemon Adventures manga and in PTS, it has been referred to as ""X"".

[NAME] is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Geomancy. It is also the only known Pokemon that can have Fairy Aura as an Ability.",Fairy,,Fairy,,1.0,0,"[""Fairy""]",949,10,959
Archaludon,1018,Alloy,"[NAME] is a tall, metallic, bipedal dinosaur-like Pokemon with an angular, cuboid body bent at its chest and hips. Its body is composed of highly durable metal and is primarily cool gray. It possesses dark blue accents on its palms and soles, as well as dark blue platings on its face and underside. The underside plating has criss-crossing patterns on the torso, and two red stripes at the bottom, with three small notches on each of them. This plating extends past [NAME]'s head at the sides, forming horn-like features tipped with red. There is a continuous protrusion running the length of [NAME]'s spine, three pairs of zigzag patterns on its sides, and spikes on the back of its head and the tip of its large tail.

[NAME]'s head is small compared to its body and is sunken into its neck. The plating on its face is T-shaped with a few indents on the sides, and folds down the middle to partially cover its yellow eyes. Its mouth, shaped into a permanent scowl, opens at the upper jaw and contains a grooved copper-colored tube, which it uses to fire beams to attack. When it closes its mouth, the tube is concealed and resembles teeth.

[NAME]'s hands and feet are large and V-shaped, each of which are connected to cuboid forelimbs and have two rectangular digits. On these hands and feet, [NAME] has tall, retractable spires near the joints, with the spires on its feet usually retracted. These spires contain pointed, yellow terminals at their tips, which gather and store static electricity from [NAME]'s surroundings, as it is incapable of producing electricity on its own. Similar terminal pairs are found on the spikes on [NAME]'s head and tail.

When [NAME] faces danger, it will get down on all fours, straighten its body, retract its limbs, and fully extend the spires on its hands and feet, forming a shape that resembles a steel bridge. This position allows for less mobility but offers [NAME] a sturdier center of gravity. In this position, [NAME] is capable of using the static electricity stored in its terminals to fire a tremendously powerful beam of electric energy. When [NAME] charges up to fire this beam, electrical energy connects the terminals on its head, tail, and limbs, in a similar fashion to bridge suspension cables. During storms and other inclement weather, [NAME]'s terminals can gather static electricity more easily, allowing it to fire off its beam much faster. [NAME]'s defensive capabilities are so strong that it cannot be fazed by a cave-in. [NAME] resides in boreal mountains, and often digs holes in its habitat while searching for food.

[NAME] and its pre-evolved form, Duraludon, are the only known Pokemon that can have Stalwart as an Ability. Additionally, [NAME] is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Electro Shot.

Zekrom,644,Deep Black,"[NAME] is a black, bipedal Pokemon resembling a saurian winged dragon, with a primarily charcoal-colored hide and pure black patches on various portions of its body. It has red sclerae, white irises, and black pupils, as well as a small horn-like protrusion on the tip of its snout. Its head sports a thundercloud-like crest tipped with light-blue coloration. There are six pairs of pointed teeth visible when its mouth is open, two in the upper jaw and four in the lower. At the base of its neck is a black, stud-like feature, and atop its shoulders are similar, larger features resembling armor padding. The bases of its wings also have such padding and a fanned, splayed, seemingly webbed shape with a small ""wing-spike"" on one edge. The lower lengths of [NAME]'s arms extend into splayed, seemingly webbed, somewhat baseball-mitt-like formations, with three-clawed, dark-colored hands on the undersides. The front portion of [NAME]'s waist is black-colored, with its belly and thighs having thin striations down their length. Its knees are black, as are the foremost parts of its three-clawed feet and spiked heels. When its emotions surge, it enters Overdrive mode, and its tail lights up with a blue light.
[NAME]'s tail consists of a large, round, conical, and spiked formation, likened to an electricity generator, with a black inner portion and bands on the tip of the outside portion. This tail produces energy for wide-ranging electric attacks and emits an anti-gravity field, allowing [NAME] to fly through the air with minimal effects from aerodynamic resistance and gravity. This tail generator is also activated when influenced by either Reshiram's signature moves, which in turn powers up [NAME]'s. It can cause several thunderstorms in one area, and it normally hides in thunderclouds. [NAME] can coat itself in electricity while physically striking its opponents. [NAME] loves [NAME] Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered it in the past.

In Unovan mythology, [NAME] was created from a single Dragon Pokemon owned by the twin heroes when it split into two: [NAME] and Reshiram. It sided with the younger brother who sought ideals; as a result, it firmly believes in ideals. [NAME] is said to be Reshiram's equal in battle, meaning neither of the two dragons can truly defeat the other. It is powerful enough to destroy the Unova region with its lightning powers. [NAME] will transform into the Dark Stone should its body get destroyed or when attacked by Kyurem's tendril-like appendages. [NAME] can willingly transform itself back from said stone when awakened by a hero who believes in ideals. According to one myth, [NAME] used its lightning to annihilate kingdoms of people who have lost the righteousness in their hearts.

[NAME] is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Bolt Strike by leveling up. Additionally, [NAME] and Black Kyurem are the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Fusion Bolt by leveling up. [NAME] and Black Kyurem are also the only known Pokemon that can have Teravolt as an Ability.",Dragon,Electric,Dragon,Electric,1.0,1,"[""Dragon"",""Electric""]",935,11,946
Celesteela,797,Launch,"[NAME] is a large, vaguely humanoid Ultra Beast with a bodily construction that resembles a cross between a space shuttle and a bamboo shoot. It has a small, white head with a tiny mouth and a skinny neck with three segments. On top of its head is a gray structure resembling a hat with long, flowing hair underneath. The hair reaches midway down its body and is rimmed with bright blue. The ""hat"" has two small blue dots and four white spikes arranged in an X-shape. These spikes resemble decorative hair sticks. On the very top of its hat is a long gray horn similar to a drill bit. It has large, disembodied gray arms that resemble bamboo stalks. At the end of each arm is a ring of bright blue, fin-like projections and a collection of eight smaller, black bamboo shoots. Each smaller stalk has a bright blue ring with a small line extending back up the stalk. Its main body is conical and resembles a dress with four overlapping layers. The shortest and outermost layer is the shortest and appears metallic, while the inner layers are each a lighter shade of green, progressively longer, and seem to be cloth or plant material. Underneath all the layers is a white body with a light gray crisscross pattern covering it and a bright blue ring along the base. Below the dress is what appears to be a collection of eight black bamboo stalks. On the bottom of each stalk is a bright blue ring with a small line extending back up the stalk; this causes the stalks to also resemble solid rocket boosters. [NAME] is one of the heaviest Pokemon, tying with Cosmoem.

[NAME] live in another world named Ultra Crater. It appears to grow out of the ground like a plant in its homeworld, before exploding the ground around itself and flying away into space for unknown reasons. According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation, [NAME]'s most distinctive feature is the energy that it stores within itself, a flammable gas that it can shoot from its two huge arms and bottom.
This is mostly used to propel itself in flight and for battle, but it has sufficient power and lift to even fly into space. Its bodily construction closely resembles that of a plant, specially bamboo, even being capable of absorbing nutrients from the soil.

Wicke also claims that like all Ultra Beasts, [NAME] stores Z-Power, the same energy possessed by Totem Pokemon, within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura. [NAME]'s rocket thrusters are powerful enough to destroy an entire bamboo forest. As seen in ''Rise and Shine, Starship!'', [NAME] have a long lifespans, as one was buried in Alola, growing for over 200 years. According to the legend ""The Celestial Starship"", told in that same episode, a mysterious object fell from the sky and was discovered by an old couple to be a large bamboo shoot, which greatly resembled an infant version of [NAME], being later named Celeste by the couple. The couple cared for it, but due to it absorbing the nutrients of the plants around itself, the other villagers tried attacking it, but Celeste transformed and flew away into space. According to Wicke, [NAME] was named after the legend of Celeste.",Steel,Flying,Steel,Flying,1.0,1,"[""Steel"", ""Flying""]",943,12,955
Pecharunt,1025,Subjugation,"[NAME] is a small Pokemon resembling a piece of mochi. It has two forms it can take both inside and outside of battle. The first form resembles an upside-down peach, with a black circular face at the center and a thin, vertical line splitting its body into two halves. In its face are two white semicircle eyes, appearing to be frowning. It takes its second form upon opening up, revealing a smaller inner body resembling a peach's pit. It has a darker purple and pink body with two white eyes which are usually frowning, below which is a white, ribbon-shaped mouth. On its head rests two purple flaps and a scorpion-like ponytail. It has two heart-shaped paws at the bottom of its body, along with three black dots on each side underneath them. The discarded shell floats on both sides of [NAME], forming spiky wing-like appendages. The inside of these shells have a bright pink glow, outlined in black. The bright pink extends slightly through the black outline in six thin lines. The chains have a magenta color to them and are divided in identical segments, ending in a slightly larger segment with two protrusions, making it resemble the shape of [NAME]'s shell.

[NAME] stores poison in its peach-shaped shell and uses it to create toxic chains and roll up poisonous Binding Mochi, which are stored in its shell until they are needed. It is able to use its toxic chains in combat, badly poisoning its enemies in the process. The chains are also capable of empowering other Pokemon, using its toxins to enhance certain aspects of their bodies, such as their muscles, brain, or looks, as seen with Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti, respectively. It serves its mochi to Pokemon and humans, but may also shoot them at their mouths if necessary. The mochi draw out their deepest desires and powers, but the ones who eat it become chained to [NAME]'s will, as seen with its caretakers, who had their greed drawn out. In some cases, the ones that eat it may completely fall under its control, as seen with Mossui Town's residents and the player's friends from Paldea.

According to the player, [NAME] smells incredibly sweet. It is known to feign weakness by weeping, and acting like a baby in order to gain sympathy from others. [NAME] can retreat into its shell and remain dormant for years. After being knocked out in Kitakami, it started being known as the ""Never-Rotting Peach"" due to its peach-like shell.

Humans under [NAME]'s control have purple eyes and are surrounded by a purple aura. It can even command humans and Pokemon to fight for it in battles, capable of controlling many beings at once. It relies on others to fight for it due to its cowardly personality and size. However, [NAME] will fight back if it is has no other option. Capturing [NAME] will free those under its control with no memories of being controlled. 

[NAME] is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Malignant Chain. It is also the only known Pokemon that can have Poison Puppeteer as an Ability.

Guzzlord,799,Junkivore,"[NAME] is a massive, black Ultra Beast. Its main body is primarily spherical with a large, yellow mouth in the center. The top and bottom of the mouth are lined with two rows of teeth; the front row is yellow, while the rear row is black. In the second row of the upper jaw, two teeth curve out of the mouth similar to tusks. The inside of its mouth is a bright blue and its throat is lined with small spikes; its large black tongue is also lined with small spikes. Additional tongues resembling long arms with pincers protrude from its lower jaw even when its mouth is closed. Just above its mouth are two glowing, blue eyes with a yellow, diamond-shaped marking between them. Above each eye is a single, bat-like wing with yellow along the upper edge. There are other small bat-like wings down the sides of its body as well. On the underside of its body are three, fin-like projections that curve up towards its mouth. [NAME]'s body is supported by a pair of thick legs, which have yellow zigzag markings across the knees and three claws each. On top of its body is a small, conical head with a second, smaller pair of glowing blue eyes. Four short horns with yellow tips form a ring around its head. On either side of its head is a larger, slightly curved horn also tipped in yellow. There is also a pair of arms on top of its body. Each arm has a hand with three yellow claws. A row of small spikes trails down its back and along its tail. The tail itself extends from the center of its back and resembles a medieval mace.

[NAME] live in another world known as the Ultra Ruin, which is an alternate universe's Alola, more specifically Hau'oli City. In the SM episode ''Battling the Beast Within!'', it was revealed that [NAME] is not native to the Ultra Ruin; it actually got there through an Ultra Wormhole and started devouring everything, leaving a barren wasteland behind. In the same episode, it was revealed that the second face above its maw is [NAME]'s weak point. Its body is said to feel like hard rubber. In order to eat, its tongue moves in a wave-like motion that pulls food towards its mouth. [NAME] has an astounding appetite, devouring not only objects, but the ground, rivers, and even the seas. There have been reports of it eating mountains and buildings whole. Despite the massive amounts that it consumes, no droppings have been found, which may suggest its digestion is perfect, converting everything into energy in order to sustain itself. According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation, [NAME]'s most distinctive feature is its limitless appetite. It feeds without pause every moment that it is awake. It uses the two large tongues that protrude from its mouth to catch and devour everything in its path, be it organic or inorganic matter. And while it eats such an inordinate amount, [NAME] excreta has never been discovered. It is thought that it might fully convert the things that it eats into energy for it to use.

Wicke also claims that like all Ultra Beasts, [NAME] stores Z-Power, the same energy possessed by Totem Pokemon, within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura.",Dark,Dragon,Dark,Dragon,1.0,1,"[""Dark"", ""Dragon""]",950,140,1090
Type: Null,772,Synthetic,"[NAME] is a quadrupedal, chimeric Pokemon with traits from a variety of creatures. Its head is enclosed in a brown helmet with green markings, designed to suppress its power to stable levels. The helmet is extremely heavy and hinders its agility. The helmet has a large jaw piece that wraps around the front with large, round hinges on the side. Each hinge is covered by a green X-shaped marking. The name of the Pokemon, as it wears the helmet, is called Null meaning nothing. Small gray eyes can be seen from within rectangular black holes on the front, and there are two pointed ears on the top. Around the base is a collar with four protruding vanes that are tipped with a three-way spike. This collar has a thin green line between the vanes, and each vane has a green hexagon near the end. An axe-like blade with a band around the middle extends backward from the top of the helmet. The front tip of the blade has a small, silver spike that hooks downward.

A mane of gray fur hangs from below [NAME]'s helmet and covers its shoulders and chest. Most of its torso and legs is covered in short black fur. The lower half of each front leg is insectoid and green with spikes along the back, while the rear legs have thick purple scales on the flanks, shins, and on the top of the foot. All four of its feet have three toes, but in the front two toes face forward and one backward. Additionally, the hind paws have a short, gray claw on the back of the ankle. Its fishlike tail consists of two dark blue spines with a light blue fin stretched between them. The top spine has a line of short, gray spikes.

[NAME] was created by the Aether Foundation as part of the beast killer project. It was designed to be an ""Anti-UB Fighting life-form"", a weapon created to fight against the Ultra Beasts. Also known as ""'''beast killer'''"", [NAME] was developed with cells taken from all known Pokemon types. This was done with the intention of giving it the ability to shift between types by holding a corresponding memory, an ability originally inspired by the myths researched at Canalave Library. This ability led the Aether Foundation to name it ""Type: Full"". Three known models of Type: Full were created, but all three rejected the RKS System and went berserk. Faba had created limiter helmets for these Pokemon, and after being subdued, the three Type: Full were given the helmets to lessen the effects of the RKS System's rejection and were put into permanent cryogenic stasis. Thus, the beast killer project was deemed a failure, and the creature's name changed to [NAME]. At some point before the events of Generation VII, Gladion was able to free one of the [NAME], which he adopted as his own in the hopes of finding a way to undo the effects of the limiter helmet and allow it to use the RKS System. Gladion would eventually rediscover its Evolution, Type: Full, renaming it as Silvally. When [NAME] evolves into Silvally, it breaks the helmet it wears in the process. Prior to the events of Pokemon Sword and Shield, a new [NAME] is created in the Galar region, apparently by Macro Cosmos by utilizing research notes stolen from Alola. Being created to hunt down Ultra Beasts, as seen in Pokemon the Series: Sun & Moon and Pokemon Adventures, [NAME] can feel the appearance of Ultra Beasts and the opening of Ultra Wormholes.",Normal,,Normal,,1.0,0,"[""Normal""]",997,9,1006
Solgaleo,791,Sunne,"[NAME] is a large, white Pokemon resembling a lion. It has a blunt muzzle with a blue-gray nose and pale blue eyes. The top half of its face is a deep blue area that shows a constantly changing starscape. Four yellow spikes frame [NAME]'s head like a crown and two more pairs of spikes adorn either side of its lower jaw. Each spike separates large tufts of [NAME]'s mane. Solid ridges—red nearest [NAME]'s head and yellow farther away—poke out of each tuft along the middle, except on the tufts on its cheeks and chin, with the topmost part wrapping around the tip of the tuft. Overall, its mane creates the impression of a stylized sun. Around each leg is a dark orange band, and there is a black spot on each foot. It has three black toes on each foot with long yellow claws. At the tip of its tail is a large black spot with a thin yellow rim.

When [NAME] enters its Radiant Sun phase, its third eye—a light blue symbol similar to a compass rose—appears on its forehead, and the starscape turns to streaks of light. The fur on its body glows a pale yellow and all red and black parts of its body, including its belly and paws, turn bright yellow. It enters this phase while using its signature move or traveling through Ultra Space.

[NAME] has long been honored as an emissary of the sun; [NAME] can create Ultra Wormholes to travel to and from Ultra Space. It can slam into its target with the force of a meteor. Alongside its counterpart Lunala, it can create Cosmog, which it is said to be the male Evolution of. [NAME] and Lunala also have the power to create Z-Crystals and even restore Necrozma's light, allowing it to return to its true, Ultra form. It can also influence a Rockruff's Evolution into Lycanroc's Midday form with solar energy. Ultra Recon Squad uses [NAME] as their own Ride Pokemon to travel through Ultra Space.

[NAME], similar to Lunala, is a being composed of light; due to that, it is constantly hunted down by Necrozma through Ultra Space, so it can try and devour [NAME]'s light to ease its nonstop pain and regain its original form. This has resulted in an eternal conflict where Necrozma attempts to steal its limitless energy, with [NAME] or its counterpart Lunala chasing after it to regain the stolen energy of light in an endless loop. When Necrozma takes control of [NAME], Necrozma's body divides into pieces that connect to [NAME]'s body like an armor, possessing it and transforming itself into Dusk Mane Necrozma, as its pieces constantly absorb [NAME]'s light. However, [NAME] can coexist with Necrozma willingly, regardless of fusion. [NAME] loves [NAME] Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered it in the past.

[NAME] and Dusk Mane Necrozma are the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Sunsteel Strike. They are also the only known Pokemon capable of using the Z-Move Searing Sunraze Smash. Additionally, [NAME] is the only known Pokemon that can have Full Metal Body as an Ability.

Charizard,6,Flame,"[NAME] is a draconic, bipedal Pokemon. It is primarily orange with a cream underside from the chest to the tip of its tail. It has a long neck, small blue eyes, slightly raised nostrils, and two horn-like structures protruding from the back of its rectangular head. Two fangs are visible in its upper jaw when its mouth is closed. Two large wings with blue-green undersides sprout from its back, and a horn-like appendage juts out from the top of the third joint of each wing. A single wing finger is visible through the center of each wing membrane. [NAME]'s arms are short and skinny compared to its robust belly, and each limb has three white claws. In Pokemon Red and Green, [NAME] is seemingly shown holding a fireball, implying that it's capable of manipulating its flames using its hands; this is seen in media where it uses Fire Punch. It has stocky legs with cream-colored soles on each of its plantigrade feet. The tip of its long, tapering tail burns with a sizable flame, which can intensify to a blue flame if [NAME] is irritated. 

[NAME] typically inhabits mountains and valleys, such as the Charicific Valley in Johto. However, [NAME] can also live in volcanoes, forming packs with other members of its family, including Charmander. In Pokemon Snap, it's shown that [NAME] are fully capable of living inside lava within volcanic craters. 

[NAME] flies in search of powerful opponents to battle, and its fire will burn hotter as it gains experience. Its fiery breath can melt boulders and massive glaciers and has been known to cause forest fires accidentally. Though its fiery breath is hot, it never turns it on any opponent weaker than itself. The GS episode ''[NAME]'s Burning Ambitions'' showed that only a weak [NAME] would show off its power. The side story episode ''Those Darn Electabuzz!'' showed that [NAME] can swim underwater, with Pokemon Origins further showing that the flame on the tip of the tail can still keep burning underwater. [NAME]'s wings can carry it to an altitude of 4,600 feet (1,400 meters), but An Illustrated Book of POCKET MONSTERS notes that its droppings were found on Mt. Fuji, implying it could fly thrice as high. In Pokemon Sleep, as well as media like the animated series, [NAME] is known to sleep in an incredibly relaxed position,  as it is very confident in its power. It has three different sleep styles: ''Stomach Sleep'' (also used for ''Atop-Belly Sleep''), ''Tummy-Rub Sleep'', and ''Tummy-Up Sleep'' - the last of which has [NAME] sleeping flat on its back, which may be an indicator of that [NAME] being especially strong. In the animated series, it was shown that [NAME] may be vulnerable to their tail flame going out in the same way as Charmander, according to the OS episode ''[NAME] Chills'', where Ash warns his [NAME] to not let its flame go out.

Even though [NAME] originally couldn't learn the move Fly, Trainers have been shown riding [NAME] in official artwork dating back to the 1997 Carddass Trading Cards. Ash himself was shown riding his [NAME] already in the second season of the original series of ''Pokemon the Series''. Eventually, in Yellow, [NAME] became able to learn Fly and has since been frequently depicted as a Pokemon able to carry people on its back to fly them to distant areas. In Alola, [NAME] is a Ride Pokemon called [NAME] Glide, being used by the natives to fly around the region or make deliveries.

Mewtwo,150,Genetic,"[NAME] is an artificial Pokemon. It is a bipedal, humanoid Pokemon with some feline features. Its body is primarily gray with a long, purple tail and a large purple underbelly. On top of its head are two short, blunt, ear-like horns, and it has purple eyes. A tube extends from the back of its skull to the top of its spine, bypassing its neck. It has a defined chest and shoulders, which resemble a breastplate. The three digits on each hand and foot have spherical tips. Its tail is thick at the base but thins before ending in a small bulb.

According to journals found in Kanto's Pokemon Mansion, after discovering the Mythical Pokemon Mew and gathering some of its DNA, Mr. Fuji used it in his mansion to create [NAME], a modified clone of Mew with the goal to making it the most powerful Pokemon of all. It was held and studied in the mansion, where it acquired extreme power and a vicious disposition after enduring horrific gene-splicing experiments. It eventually broke free and fled the Mansion, destroying it in the process. It is widely known as one of the most powerful Pokemon in existence and is said to have the most savage heart among all Pokemon, lacking compassion and striking fear into its enemy with cold, glowing eyes. [NAME] conserves energy by remaining motionless in order to unleash its full power in battle. Because it was engineered to be the ultimate opponent in battle, it can only think of defeating its foes. Though rarely seen in the wild, it is said to be resting in dark caves somewhere.

In ''[NAME] Strikes Back'', M01 was shown to be capable of levitation, mind control, memory erasure, telepathy, teleporting others to another location, and the creation of powerful storms. However, it was later shown to be caring, protective, and even altruistic. As shown in POKÉMON Detective Pikachu, [NAME] can also transfer a human's soul into a Pokemon's body provided that said Pokemon is in a crazed state, causing this person to gain control of the Pokemon's body and abilities. It possesses a rivalry with M01. As seen in ''Genesect and the Legend Awakened'', M16 can breathe in outer space.

In the Pokemon Adventures manga, [NAME]'s creation wasn't possible with the amount of Mew's cells gathered, so to complete it, human cells were used instead, specifically from the Team Rocket scientist Blaine. Due to Blaine possessing some of [NAME]'s cells as well, the two became linked, which granted Blaine to ability to track its whereabouts at the cost of slowly taking his life.

[NAME] is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Psystrike.

;Shadow [NAME]
A unique variant of [NAME], called Shadow [NAME], is very similar to standard [NAME], but with dark gray skin, a dark gray tail with a yellowish orange tip, and a shard of Shadow Synergy Stone coming out of its shoulder. In the past, Anne was almost possessed by a Shadow Synergy Stone but was saved by [NAME], whom the Shadow Synergy Stone took control of and merged with instead. Under the stone's influence, Shadow [NAME] travelled around Ferrum, draining Gaia Power from other normal Synergy Stones, which continuously increases its power.

Lugia,249,Diving,"[NAME] is a large Pokemon that resembles a dragon, a plesiosaur, and a bird. It is primarily silver-white, but it has blue undersides with slightly varying tones. It has a ridged mouth similar to a beak, although it has pointed teeth on its lower jaw. Its head has a point to the back, and [NAME]'s eyes have pointed blue or black spikes on them. [NAME] has a long, slender neck and a smooth, streamlined body. Dark blue or black plate-like protrusions run down the length of its back, and there are two smaller, more pointed ones on the end of its tail. It has large wings that resemble hands.

[NAME] can fold back these plates to increase its speed. Though it is gender unknown, as depicted in ''The Mystery is History'', a young [NAME] has been seen, suggesting there is a breeding population, at least in the animated series timeline. In the same episode, [NAME] has been shown to be fiercely protective of its young, which also eat kelp. In the second Pokemon movie, [NAME] leads the legendary birds and when they fight over territory, [NAME] is the only Pokemon that can quell their ceaseless fighting, but cannot do so without a partner. Much like the birds, it possesses the ability to control the weather; most notably, it can calm and give rise to storms. 

It is said that a light flutter of its wings is capable of causing winds powerful enough to tear a regular house down. If it were to flap its wings, it could hypothetically spawn storms lasting as long as forty days. [NAME] is capable of splitting islands into smaller islands. When attacking, it is capable of shooting a vortex of air at its target and using psychic power. It is highly intelligent, and because of the devastating power it could accidentally inflict, it isolates itself deep underwater and tends to sleep in solitude. It is extremely rare and is hardly ever seen. In ancient times, the former Brass Tower in Ecruteak City was once [NAME]'s perch. However, after its destruction 150 years ago, [NAME] moved to the Whirl Islands for the safety of others from its own power. It can be summoned at the Whirl Island through one of its feathers, Tidal Bells, and the dance of the Kimono Girls. [NAME] had many different titles throughout the years as the ""'''guardian of the seas'''"", ''deity of the sea'', ""beast of the sea"", ""mythical sea creature"", and ""vengeance deity"".. There are rumors [NAME] would appear during the night of a storm. [NAME] loves [NAME] Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered it in the past.

[NAME] is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Aeroblast.

;Shadow [NAME]
'''Shadow [NAME]''' is the first and only XD-series Shadow Pokemon created by Lovrina of Cipher. It has jagged silver eye-spikes, a dark-purple body with white undersides, and glowing red eyes. It also has sharper toes that resemble claws, as well as a longer, more pointed tongue. Additionally, due to the shape of [NAME]'s back plates on its 3D models being changed after Generation IV, Shadow [NAME] now possesses a unique design for them. 

Shadow [NAME] is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Shadow Blast.

Eternatus,890,Gigantic,"[NAME] is a gigantic, draconic alien Pokemon. Its body has a vaguely draconic shape and skeletal appearance, and it is largely dark violet with red highlights. Its main body and tail are long and thin and resemble a spinal column, and it has four small, thin limbs ending in claws formed from spindly appendages attached at right angles. Its torso is formed from a cage of appendages resembling ribs, and inside is a glowing pink core that serves as [NAME]'s energy source, absorbing energy to sustain it. Its head is triangular and has a pair of white, eye-like markings in the form of three connected circles, as well as a spindly lower jaw with several diamond-shaped teeth. Over its head is a translucent red film held between five long spikes extending toward its body's rear. It also has a pair of thin tendrils extending from its back, formed from numerous triangular segments. [NAME]'s gigantic size makes it the tallest known Pokemon with the exception of Dynamax and Gigantamax Pokemon.

[NAME] serves as the source of the Dynamax phenomenon in Galar due to its power leaking out in the form of Galar particles following its defeat 3000 years ago by Zacian, Zamazenta, and two human youths. After it reawakened in the present day, [NAME]'s core needed to reabsorb the Galar particles in order to remain active, apparently due to its past defeat weakening it. In Pokemon Masters EX, [NAME] can replace Galar particles by absorbing sync stone energy in massive amounts instead. Its core can also project its absorbed energy into massive blasts fired directly from its center. These blasts are capable of causing more damage to Dynamax and Gigantamax Pokemon. Pieces of its body imbued with its power rain down throughout Galar in the form of Wishing Pieces and Wishing Stars. When it is awake, [NAME] causes a phenomenon dubbed the Darkest Day, in which the massive quantities of Dynamax energy it unleashes cause Pokemon to Dynamax and rampage uncontrollably. It can also sometimes keep other Pokemon from Dynamaxing in its presence. Despite this connection to the phenomenon, it cannot Dynamax itself, as its Eternamax form replaces that effect.

As depicted in the JN episode ''Sword and Shield: ""From Here to [NAME]!""'', [NAME] can use its energy core to target a Pokemon and force it to Dynamax or Gigantamax. The series also elaborates upon its ability to block other Pokemon from Dynamaxing, depicting this power as [NAME] absorbing the Galar particles in the area to make them unavailable for other Pokemon to use. The same episode also shows that [NAME] can forcibly revert other Pokemon that have already Dynamaxed or Gigantamaxed through the same process. In the animated series, Rose coined [NAME]'s name, but in the past, it was known as the ""Darkest Day"", as referred to by the people of Galar who feared it 3000 years ago. As seen in chapter ''Oh My!! The Disappearance of Henry'' of the Pokemon Adventures manga, [NAME]'s poison has the capability of altering people's behavior, making them violent and selfish, as shown with Henry after he touched the poison. As later mentioned by Calyrex in ''Munch Munch!! The Mysterious Carrot'', both met during the first Darkest Day.

[NAME] is an extraterrestrial Pokemon that came to the Pokemon world inside an asteroid around 20,000 years ago. It's implied by Peonia that [NAME]'s asteroid (referred to as a massive Wishing Star) landed at the Crown Tundra, specifically in Slippery Slope, creating a cavern now known as the Max Lair.

Necrozma,800,Prism,"[NAME] is a vaguely humanoid Pokemon whose body appears to be constructed out of a black crystalline material. [NAME]'s body is primarily prismatic and black due to the amount of impurities in its system. The large protrusion attached to its head is its tail, which has a row of three large spikes along the top and is white in the back with a dark gray symbol resembling a eight-pointed star in the center. Its face is actually a prism-like object known as the ""brain prism"", which possesses a collection of multicolored shapes that resemble eyes. While absorbing light, this brain prism glows white. Its thin arms have disproportionately large hands with three claws. Jutting out of the back of each hand is a whitish crystal that darkens toward the tip, and each elbow has a hook-like spike. Two large spikes jut from each shoulder and there is a row of smaller spikes along each side of its body. Its feet have three hook-like toes each.

[NAME] originates from Ultra Space and is capable of opening and traveling through Ultra Wormholes. This causes many to believe [NAME] is one of the Ultra Beasts, however, different accounts refer to [NAME] as a ""reminiscent of the Ultra Beasts"" and ""a creature almost like an Ultra Beast"". It once had the ability to give light in its original form, but lost this ability along its true form after being heavily injured by the Ultra Recon Squad's ancestors in an attempt to steal its light; Professor Kukui and Lillie theorize that the Sparkling Stones and the Z-Crystals used to perform Z-Moves are fragments of [NAME]'s body that it lost upon being injured and rained down into Alola. According to the Ultra Recon Squad, the light that radiates from [NAME] is the aura that surrounds the Trainer and Pokemon while performing a Z-Move and the aura surrounding a Totem Pokemon. This energy is consumed by Pokemon such as the Ultra Beasts and radiated by Pokemon such as Solgaleo and Lunala.

[NAME] displays extremely violent behavior due to the constant, maddening pain it suffers in its incomplete state. Desperate for the light it requires to sustain itself and regain its original form, [NAME] absorbs light from other beings and places. This behavior caused it to be feared as and known as a ""pillager of light"" in ancient times. [NAME] has an eternal conflict that cycles with Solgaleo and Lunala for their limitless light energy.[NAME] usually absorbs the light energy from either Solgaleo or Lunala, or sometimes both, resulting in the respective Legendary Pokemon chasing after [NAME] to regain its light energy.

Its black coloration is a result of impurities building up within it as a result of its deep slumber. [NAME] can shoot powerful lasers using the power of a prism. These lasers are powerful enough to blast through anything it hits. It can also attack its foes with a large pillar of light. Using its tail, it is able to propel itself by shooting black light from it. When [NAME] absorbs light from a world, that world becomes shrouded in darkness until the stolen light is returned as seen temporarily in Alola and in Ultra Megalopolis. In SM, the Aether Foundation confused [NAME] for an Ultra Beast and gave it a code name, ""UB: Black"". As seen in ''Filling the Light with Darkness'', [NAME] is capable of absorbing a world's Ultra Aura, which causes adults to become more tired and lose motivation. [NAME] loves [NAME] Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered and roared loudly to intimidate it in the past.

[NAME] is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the moves Prismatic Laser and Photon Geyser. It is also the only known Pokemon that can have Prism Armor as an Ability.",Psychic,,Psychic,,1.0,0,"[""Psychic""]",1057,138,1195
Lunala,792,Moone,"[NAME] is a large Pokemon resembling a skeletal, legless bat. It has a short snout, dark pink eyes with white centers, and a deep blue area on its upper head that shows a constantly changing starscape. A rigid raised hood wraps around its head in a crescent shape and drapes around its neck as well. The outside of the hood is yellow, while the inner part that curves around [NAME]'s head is white with deep blue streaks. Its torso resembles a ribcage with a slightly curved spike on each shoulder and three spikes extending from the bottom toward its tail. Its massive wings resemble a bat's wings with the skeleton exposed, except that [NAME]'s wings have a total of seven ""finger bones"": four running through each wing, one running along the edge to the outermost tip, and two pointing upwards that may act as claws that are more functional. The four ""bones"" in [NAME]'s wings are only visible in segments. The skin of [NAME]'s wings is an iridescent deep blue and a light blue light source appears to glow from behind its ribcage. A large, pale yellow crescent connects the outermost tip of each wing to the next two inner tips, and the remaining two innermost tips are adorned by yellow, four-pointed stars. The bottom of [NAME]'s tail is also lined by a yellow crescent with a ridge running up the middle of the tail towards the rib cage.

When [NAME] enters its Full Moon phase, its third eye—a light red symbol of an eye—appears on its forehead, and the starscape turns to streaks of light. The skin of its wings glows a bright, light blue. It spreads its wings wide so that the golden parts on each wing are arranged in a circle. It enters this phase while using its signature move or traveling through Ultra Space.

[NAME] has long been honored as an emissary of the moon; in ancient times, it was known as ""the beast that calls the moon"". This Pokemon constantly absorbs light to convert it into energy and can obscure daylight with darkness. When it spreads its wings to absorb light and glitter, it resembles a beautiful night sky. It is said to live in another world, which it returns to when it opens its third eye. [NAME] can create Ultra Wormholes to travel to and from Ultra Space. It can emit a sinister ray to attack its target. Alongside its counterpart, Solgaleo, it can create Cosmog, which it is said to be the female Evolution of. [NAME] and Solgaleo also have the power to create Z-Crystals and even restore Necrozma's light, allowing it to return to its true, Ultra form. It can also influence a Rockruff's Evolution into Lycanroc's Midnight form with lunar energy. Ultra Recon Squad use [NAME] as their own Ride Pokemon to travel through Ultra Space.

[NAME], similar to Solgaleo, is a being composed of light; due to that, it is constantly hunted down by Necrozma through Ultra Space, so it can try and devour [NAME]'s light to ease its nonstopping pain and regain its original, form. [NAME] is in an eternal conflict with Necrozma, which seeks to steal its boundless energy. Solgaleo, along with [NAME], pursues Necrozma to reclaim the stolen energy of light in an unending cycle.  When Necrozma takes control of [NAME], Necrozma's body divides into pieces that connect to [NAME]'s body like an armor, possessing it and transforming itself into Dawn Wings Necrozma, as its pieces constantly absorb [NAME]'s light. However, [NAME] can coexist with Necrozma willingly, regardless of fusion. [NAME] loves [NAME] Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered it in the past.

[NAME] and Dawn Wings Necrozma are the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Moongeist Beam. They are also the only known Pokemon capable of using the Z-Move Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom. Additionally, [NAME] is the only known Pokemon that can have Shadow Shield as an Ability.

Shellder,90,Bivalve,"[NAME] is a bivalve mollusk Pokemon encased within a spiky, blue-violet bivalve shell. It has two round white eyes with tiny black pupils. Its long, red tongue, usually hidden due to the darkness of [NAME]’s body, extends from its often closed mouth. [NAME] uses this tongue to burrow into the sand to sleep overnight and to lure and capture prey. If it were to close its shell, nothing could come to it; however, the tongue protrudes even when its shell is shut. Tugging on it will cause the shell to pop open. Its soft and tender body is well-protected by its extremely durable shell, which is purported to be harder than diamonds and has historically been used by people to make shields. It can make pearls from accumulated sand, though it discards them as they are typically in its way. 

[NAME] has an unusually strong appetite for the tail of a Slowpoke and can develop a symbiotic relationship with the Dopey Pokemon. After attaching itself to the Slowpoke's tail, the two undergo a metamorphosis and evolve into Slowbro together. Alternatively, if it attaches to the head of a Slowpoke in possession of a King's Rock, the two will instead evolve into Slowking. These relationships allow it to travel onto land and begin a new stage in its life cycle. In Galar, [NAME] attaches to the forearms and heads of Galarian Slowpoke wearing Galarica Cuffs or Galarica Wreaths, causing the Evolution into Galarian Slowbro and Galarian Slowking, respectively. [NAME] that are part of Slowbro change in shape further if it Mega Evolves.

Regardless of which form the two Pokemon evolve into, [NAME]'s shell changes to a light gray color with irregular darker spots. Its shape changes into a spiny, spiraled cone with several tiers, which is slightly rounded for Galarian Slowbro. Sharp teeth develop around the rim of the shell to anchor it securely to the evolved Slowpoke, and its eyes now peek out from the bottom rim of the shell. In its crown form, [NAME] has a large horn on either side of its shell, which is purple for Galarian Slowking. It also gains a gem: a red one on the underside for Johtonian Slowking, and a green one between its eyes for the Galarian form. As part of Mega Slowbro, it becomes large enough to contain most of the Slowpoke's body, gaining two holes near the rim and an opening at the tip, through which protrude the Slowpoke's forelegs and tail respectively. 

While in its crown form, [NAME] will periodically release its venom into Slowking's brain. This is actually beneficial to Slowking, as it causes the Regal Pokemon's intelligence to increase. Higher quantities of venom intensify this effect, and [NAME] is easily provoked into releasing more whenever Slowking yawns. However, [NAME]'s poison makes Slowbro more sluggish as it continues to drain nutrients from its host's body. As seen in ''Slowking's Crowning!'' and ''An Evolution in Taste!'', the crown form of [NAME] can take control of humans who wear it and speak through its host. The control of [NAME] wears off the moment the crown is removed.

Despite its hard shell, clamping on to an opponent will reveal its vulnerable parts. Because of this, it will only clamp itself to a foe as a last resort. It swims around its seafloor home by rapidly opening and closing its shell while facing backward. Despite its appearance, [NAME] is surprisingly fast. Prehistoric [NAME] were apparently preyed upon by Omastar, whose powerful bites were capable of breaking through its shell. [NAME] and its evolved form, Cloyster, are related to Shellos and Gastrodon. Kingler, Rufflet, and Bruxish are modern predators of [NAME].

Prior to Generation III, Clamp was its signature move. Prior to Generation V, Icicle Spear was also its signature move, but other Pokemon could still inherit it via breeding. Additionally, prior to Generation V, [NAME] and its evolved form, Cloyster, were the only known Pokemon that could have Skill Link as an Ability.

Kommo-o,784,Scaly,"[NAME] is a bipedal, reptilian Pokemon covered in scaly armor as hard as steel. Its scales were historically processed into armor, weapons, and additional commodities used by humans. Most of its body is gray with some lighter gray areas as well as yellow and red markings. It has a rounded, beak-ish snout and small eyes nearly hidden under its head armor. On the tip of its snout is a patch of pale gray and both the upper and lower jaws have a small, tooth-like spike on each side. The top of its head is covered by an elaborate arrangement of scales. At the front of the headdress is an oval scale, which is yellow with a red heart-shape at the base. On either side of the front scale is a chain of four circular scales; the first three scales are red with yellow trim and the last scale is solid yellow. Three additional chains of plain yellow scales extend from the back of the headdress. Running down the front of its long neck is a line of overlapping scales: one solid gray at the top, three larger gray ones with yellow rims, and one solid yellow scale at the bottom. A thick yellow stripe with a rounded projection in the center runs across its chest. Covering its shoulders are tufts of spiky, white feathers with small, gray scales overlapping them. Four overlapping scales cover the tops of its arms: three are gray with yellow edges and the scales that cover its hands are red with yellow edges.

[NAME] has four scaly chains, all of which consist of four scales, extending from just behind its shoulders. The two foremost chains are made of overlapping scales and have a solid gray scale at the top followed by three scales with yellow edges. The other two chains consist of only solid gray scales and do not appear to overlap. The lower halves of its legs are dark gray and there is a pale gray marking across each knee. Its hands have four yellow claws, while the feet have only three. A long line of slightly raised, pale gray scales runs down the center of its back to about halfway up its tapering tail. Near the tip of its tail are three sets of loose scales that increase in size near the tip. Each set is made up of four separate scales that encircle the tail; the two lower sets are solid yellow, while the set nearest the tip have gray centers. The very tip of its tail is pale gray.

[NAME], having completed its harsh training, returns to its birthplace to protect Jangmo-o. However, it only watches over them from a distance. The power of [NAME]'s uppercut is enough to send foes flying, so simply raising its arms can generate enough force to change its surroundings. According to legend, [NAME]'s glittering scales are meant to drive away a great darkness. The reason it seeks strong opponents is also said to be a quest for power to defeat the darkness. [NAME]'s scales can be used to generate offensive sound waves, in addition to serving as a coat of natural armor.

Because it does not wish to fight weak foes, it clangs its scales together when it senses someone approaching. This is intended to frighten off weak or cowardly opponents. [NAME] also swings the scales on its tail to threaten any enemies it sees. Upon finishing off its prey, [NAME] will let out a victory howl. Additionally, the metallic sounds made by its comrades celebrating can also be heard all around the area the group is in.

While the animated series shows that [NAME] is capable of bipedal locomotion, the core series games since Generation VIII show that it vastly prefers to walk and run around by knuckle-walking.

A special [NAME] in Alola acts as the Totem Pokemon for an unmanned trial in Vast Poni Canyon. This [NAME] possesses Z-Power, an energy that originates from Ultra Wormholes and takes the form of a golden, flaring aura. The reward for defeating Totem [NAME] and completing the trial is a Dragonium Z.

Terapagos,1024,Tera,"Normal Form [NAME] is a small reptilian Pokemon that resembles an indigo tortoise. Its head, legs, and tail stem from a cyan, hexagonal shell with the Terastal symbol on its back: a white hexagon with triangular extensions on each corner that connects it to the edges of its back. Its neck and legs each have a cyan four-pointed star and ring rub on them. Its feet each have three toes, and its tail has a cyan four-pointed star at its tip. It has two light blue eyes with rouge rimming and four-pointed star-shaped pupils. It has a diamond-like pattern on its forehead and two diamonds hanging like earrings on both sides of its head. Lastly, it has a ""ponytail"" made up of three segments of diamond-like shapes. The segments reduce in size as they get farther from the head and gain a purplish tint to them.

Normal Form [NAME] is said to have a splendid aura. It is a small and particularly weak Pokemon; for that reason, it can assume a dormant state whenever its life is put in danger or it needs to hibernate, pulling its head, limbs, and tail into its shell and shrinking in size, which makes itself look like an ordinary jewel. It also has the ability to crystallize the energy in its own body to form a green, protective barrier around itself if necessary, even in its dormant state. Through this same ability, [NAME] causes glowing, hard crystals to form around it, even in its dormant state, which gave Area Zero its distinctive appearance. As depicted in HZ, like other turtles, [NAME] is unable to move if it is turned upside down, needing outside help to stand back up. It has shown to have an incredibly long lifespan, with one known to have lived for millions of years while slumbering within its shell.

[NAME] is responsible for the Terastal phenomenon. [NAME] inhabited the Paldea region in a bygone era. It was thought that this species went extinct, with it said to have been caught up in seismic shifts that occurred about 2,000,000 years ago. However, one of them managed to survive by crystallizing its own body and going into hibernation in the Area Zero Underdepths, where it laid low until the present day. According to Briar, [NAME] is made of Terastal energy. Heath is the one who discovered [NAME] and coined its name. With the power of its crystals, [NAME] can bombard its foes with star-shaped projectiles. After ''The Approaching Shadow!'', Spinel comes to the conclusion that [NAME] and Laquium are opposite forces. In ''Beyond the Shining Rainbow'', it was shown absorbing the energy of the crystals in Area Zero to power up. In ''Guided by the Black Rayquaza!'', it was also shown gathering its allies' power into itself to power up as well. As shown in HZ092, Sableye, who feed on gemstones and crystals, seem to be interested in [NAME]'s crystalline body.

[NAME] also has the ability to alter timelines in some capacity, as seen in the core series games and animated series. An example if this is it being capable of using crystals such as the ones from the Crystal Pool to bring humans and objects forward from other points in time as seen with Professor SadaS/Professor TuroV who hasn't finished their time machine and Rystal who had lived 100 years in the past. While using this ability, a mist appears around the affected area; once it disappears, whatever was brought is sent back. As seen in several ''Pokemon Horizons'' episodes, [NAME] also has the ability to create visions of its own memories and even of other people's. Due to the Terastal energy its body produces, [NAME] was responsible for allowing advanced technologies, such as Tera Orbs, the professor's AI duplicate, and a time machine that summons Pokemon from different points in the timeline or even from other timelines, to exist in spite of human limitations. Tera Orbs directly exposed to the energy from [NAME] will gain the ability to Terastallize Pokemon without the need to recharge. [NAME] also has a strong connection to the Stellar type.

Lycanroc,745,Wolf,"[NAME] is a canine Pokemon resembling a wolf. It has three possible forms: Midday Form, Midnight Form, and Dusk Form. The first two forms are influenced by Solgaleo and Lunala when bathed in solar or lunar energy. The third form is said to have been influenced by the setting sun of the evening. [NAME] are used by humans as guards, to protect their fields from prey Deerling.
;Midday Form
In its Midday Form, [NAME] resembles a quadrupedal, light brown wolf. It has a white underbelly that extends up around its muzzle and eyes in a mask-like marking. It has pointed ears with dark brown tips and pink insides, big blue eyes, and a triangular, dark brown nose. There are four sharp fangs in its mouth: two in the upper jaw and two in the lower. Large tufts of brown fur extend from the sides of its head; three tufts on each side. A bushy, white mane covers its neck. Four dark brown rocks poke out of its mane, creating a shape similar to a stylized sun. The rocks are said to be razor-sharp. The lower portions of this form's legs are white, and each foot has three dark brown claws. It also has a long, fluffy white tail.

The Midday Form has a calm, collected, and cautious personality. In order to avoid needless fighting, the Midday Form prefers to live alone and does not form a pack with others of its kind. However, it is a fiercely loyal partner to Trainers that accept it during its unruly stage. In battle, it darts past opponents while attacking them with the rocks in its mane. These swift movements leave many foes bewildered and backed into a corner. It always aims for the foes' weak spot using its fangs. Broken fragments of its stone mane are considered good luck.

;Midnight Form
In its Midnight Form, [NAME] instead resembles a slouched, bipedal wolf or werewolf. It has short red fur with white on its lower legs and a white streak that covers its face, underbelly, and tail. It has pointed, button ears with black tips, three large tufts of fur on each side of its face, a triangular black nose, and a mouth full of sharp teeth. While the sclerae, irises, and pupils of its eye are visible, they all glow a pinkish red and no distinctive colors are visible. A mane of fur covers its back and shoulders, sweeping forward over its head to form a crescent moon shape. On either side of its body, just below the shoulders, two small rocks resembling claws poke out of the mane. A single, bigger stone projects out of the front of the mane over its head. Each of this form's paws has three black claws, and it has a stubby tail covered in long fur.

In contrast to its Midday Form, [NAME]'s Midnight Form is thrilled by battling and becomes more excited the stronger its opponent. This excitement is what causes its eyes to glow. The Midnight Form is known to be reckless along with extremely vicious temper. Its strategy consists of closing in on its opponent and encouraging attack, then countering with a powerful blow that knocks out its opponent. The full force of its headbutts can destroy giant boulders. Trainers that can draw out its power earn its trust, but it despises those that it disagrees with or who try to force it to fight.

;Dusk Form
In its Dusk Form, [NAME] resembles a combination of its Midday and Midnight Forms. Its body is similar to Midday Form with the same white color except with orange-gold fur. It retains the three brown claws for all four feet. The white fluffy mane resembles a sun with part of the crescent moon. It also has four rocks around its neck like a sun as well along with a single, bigger stone coming from the mane over its head. Its face resembles Midday Form [NAME]'s but is orange-gold with bright green eyes,  which can change to bright glowing red when angry or attacking.

The Dusk Form [NAME] shares traits from the previous two forms. Its stance, calm demeanor, and loyal nature are shared with the Midday Form. However, it also shares the Midnight Form's fighting spirit, including the red, glowing eyes at the moment of attack. Dusk Form [NAME] never barks, unlike its two other forms. Upon entering battle, [NAME] will relentlessly drive its opponents into a corner. Due to only evolving at sunset, the Dusk Form is considered the rarest of the three forms. The Dusk Form of [NAME] is rather difficult to train due to its temperamental nature. Because of this, Dusk Form [NAME] is considered the most troublesome of its three forms.

;Signature moves

Nihilego,793,Parasite,"[NAME] is an Ultra Beast that resembles a jellyfish. The bell is semi-translucent and encircled with several white, star-shaped markings. The wavy rim of the bell flares outward and is bright blue. Its tentacles appear gelatinous and give it a vaguely humanoid shape. Several tentacles mesh together forming the appearance of a cape or long hair, while four shorter tentacles resemble shorter hair and arms. Two long tentacles make up the legs of the human shape. According to its concept art, [NAME]'s body is made of various types of glass.

[NAME] was one of the first Ultra Beast discovered by Professor Mohn for the Aether Foundation. <!--He was also the one who coined [NAME]'s name.fact-->[NAME] live in another world named Ultra Deep Sea, occasionally being brought to Alola through Ultra Wormholes. Although its exact levels of intelligence are unknown, it is believed to act upon a self-preservation instinct, and displays a lack of emotion or even will. However, in addition to its constantly changing human-like shape, it is sometimes seen acting like a young girl. According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation, [NAME]'s most distinctive feature is its parasitic capability. When [NAME] latches on to a host's head, it does not manipulate its actions directly. Instead it awakens the host's own capabilities and boosts them to an extreme extent in order to protect itself. It injects the host with a sort of neurotoxin to achieve this effect. This neurotoxin of [NAME]'s is incredibly stimulating and inspires feelings of extreme excitement and a lack of inhibition in its host. Anything or anyone that [NAME] latches on to will have its native skills forcibly activated to their fullest extent and will then act as it naturally desires to. Pokemon Adventures also elaborates upon [NAME]'s neurotoxin, explaining that its venom turns their negative emotions into happiness and pleasure. It's also said that [NAME] mostly feed on those who feel intense worry or anxiety.

Wicke also claims that like all Ultra Beasts, [NAME] stores Z-Power, the same energy possessed by Totem Pokemon, within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura. As seen in the games, [NAME] are capable of creating illusions, such as making itself and its allies vanish. In ''The Homecoming Crown!'', a [NAME] was shown using its powers to see the memories of people and even alter their perception. That same episode also showed that [NAME] can demonstrate emotions other than self-preservation and the ability to heal people.


;Fusion

[NAME] is capable of physically merging with its host, such as with Lusamine in various media. In this ""merged"" state, the [NAME]'s bell loses its stars, developing several iridescent spots across its surface. Its eight tentacles become long and flattened and have numerous deep black spots with various colored diamond-shapes inside. Four of the tentacles are connected to the bell via frilly white structures; these tentacles have four spines protruding from them that can be used similarly to hands. The remaining four tentacles each terminate in a single larger spine. Lusamine's body also changes and is visible within [NAME]'s bell as her legs dangle beneath it. Her hair turns black with golden lines, her eyes turn yellow, half of her legs and dress become black as the other half becomes purple.

The toxins produced by [NAME] may remain in the host's body, even after [NAME] has left their body. This can leave the former host to remain ill for unspecified amounts of time and treatment may be necessary. [NAME] leaving a host's body can also cause unconsciousness, as is the case with Lusamine, however it unknown whether or not this is because of [NAME]'s toxins, the stress of fusion or the overwhelming amount of Z-Power within her body. This form of [NAME] is unobtainable, and is only seen with Lusamine as a Trainer. Intenerally, this form is described as '''MOTHERBEAST''', using a combination of the codenames for Lusamine (MOTHER) and the Ultra Beasts (BEAST). The Alola Region Artworks displays the fusion as '''ルザミーネ (ウツロイド)''', organizing it as a Trainer. During battle, [NAME] can control its host's Pokemon, and even empower them with its own Z-Power aura.fact

In Pokemon the Series, as depicted in ''10,000,000 Reasons to Fight!'', [NAME] can lower it tentacles to inject its toxins into the ground while sharp rocks grow below. While the same episode shows that [NAME] can willingly end this merger and it may be disrupted in other ways as well, the lingering toxins and the shock of the separation can leave the host in critical condition, both physically and psychologically. The episode also shows that [NAME] can take full control of its host and form an orb with its own mass to prevent them from escaping the fusion. [NAME] is shown to play on Lusamine's desires and reduced her mentality to that of a child's.

Koraidon,1007,Paradox,"==Biology== 
[NAME] is a large, reptilian Pokemon primarily covered in scarlet feathers with white accents on its cheeks, upper body, thighs, and tail. Its most notable feature is a tire-like gular sac on its throat, which inflates and deflates depending on its form. [NAME]'s head has a crest of feathers and a pair of long, twisted, brow-plume-like tendrils. Additional feathers at the base of its tail transition from blue to purple and end in white tips, creating a striking appearance. Its eyes have yellow sclerae, orange irises, and brown pupils, with red plumes giving the impression of eyebrows. [NAME]'s body is adorned with blue markings on its elbows and shoulders, as well as blue frills down its neck. From each shoulder, a curved, handlebar-like structure extends backward. It has webbed feet, each with four claws; the two central claws are sometimes held close together, making it appear as though there are only three. The gular sac and base of its tail share a grooved texture, but the sac is also lined with spikes.

Aware of its formidable strength, [NAME] exudes confidence and rarely feels threatened. Though cautious around humans, its curiosity sometimes leads it to play with them. Its power surges under harsh sunlight due to an ancient energy coursing through its body. In battle, [NAME] will unfurl its wings and crash into its targets with explosive force. While [NAME] bears a resemblance to modern-day Cyclizar, it is known to be far more ferocious and muscular. 

The origins of [NAME] in the present day trace back to a time machine constructed by Professor Sada, which brought two specimens to Area Zero a decade ago. These two individuals displayed contrasting temperaments: one was friendly and curious, while the other was aggressive and territorial. 200 years prior to the events of Scarlet and Violet, Heath also encountered a [NAME], as seen in the Scarlet Book, though it is unclear how it arrived in Area Zero at the time. According to AI Sada, it is an ancient Pokemon related to Cyclizar. However, a version of Professor Sada that appeared at the Crystal Pool suggests that [NAME] is a counterpart to Cyclizar from an alternate timeline.  It was formerly referred to as the ""Winged King"" in the Scarlet Book, with its current name coined by Professor Sada, potentially as a result of a bootstrap paradox.

[NAME] has five different transformations it can change between as it traverses varying terrain and adapts to different situations. In its ""Apex Build"", [NAME] shifts to a bipedal stance and adopts a poised, battle-ready posture. The feathers on its head and rear unfold and stand upright, forming a crest that resembles a war bonnet. The gular sac on its throat inflates, displaying a red, gear-like pattern, while the base of its tail becomes more robust. [NAME]'s claws spread apart, revealing the white membranes between its toes. During battle, [NAME] leverages its immense strength and array of natural weapons to overpower opponents, including powerful jaws, sharp claws, and a sturdy tail. Its legs possess extraordinary strength, allowing it to leap over 65 feet into the air and use the momentum from its falls for devastating kicks and body slams. It is said to have the power to shatter the ground with its fists alone. According to Arven, this is [NAME]'s true form. In its ""Limited Build"", [NAME] reverts to a quadrupedal stance. The feathers on its head and rear are folded and closed, and the gular sac retracts, exposing a tire-like protrusion. The webbing between its claws is not visible, as its central claws stay close together. [NAME] typically takes on this form when weakened or not engaged in battle. In all travel forms, [NAME]'s tail stays tucked in, displaying a pattern similar to that found on its gular sac. In its ""Sprinting Build"", [NAME] tucks its tail and runs on all fours, allowing it to reach high speeds and climb steep cliffs. In its ""Swimming Build"", the gular sac inflates, enabling [NAME] to float on water. It propels itself by paddling with its webbed feet. In its ""Gliding Build"", the tendrils on [NAME]'s head unfurl into wings, allowing it to glide or even fly through the sky.

[NAME] is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Collision Course. It is also the only known Pokemon that can have Orichalcum Pulse as an Ability.

Arceus,493,Alpha,"In its Normal form, [NAME] is a white, equine Pokemon with an androgynous appearance. It resembles a qilin or centaur with a gray, vertically striated underside. The striated pattern also appears on the underside of its mane, tail, and face. Its four pointed feet are tipped with gold hooves. Its long mane juts away from its head, and its face is gray, with green eyes, red pupils, and a green circular pattern below its eyes. [NAME] also has a streak of gold coloration on its head, which points upward. Its neck is fairly long, with two pairs of extrusions to the sides, and a flap-like feature on the neck's underside that is colored white like much of the body. [NAME] also has a golden cross-like wheel attached to its body by its round abdomen. The wheel also has four green jewels attached to it. The pattern of striated gray of [NAME]'s underbelly continues past its waist. Its limbs have gray undersides and extrusions at the tops of the legs. [NAME]'s tail is similar to its mane in terms of shape and coloration. Despite its quadruped appearance, [NAME] is capable of flight.

According to legend, it shaped the Pokemon universe using its 1,000 arms. [NAME] has been referred to as the ""Original One"" in myths and legends and is generally considered one of the strongest Pokemon. [NAME] is believed to be the creator of the Sinnoh and Ransei regions, the Pokemon world, and possibly, even the entire Pokemon universe. It also created eggs which the Pokemon of myth, Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina, hatched from, as well as another egg which the lake guardians, Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit, hatched from. It could also recreate these eggs if it wanted to. Because of this, [NAME] is thought to be one of the longest-lived Pokemon species, if not the oldest Pokemon in existence. In ''[NAME] and the Jewel of Life'', [NAME] is portrayed as having powers such as bringing back things that it once destroyed, making certain things vanish into thin air, halting time, and overturning the very laws of nature. In the same movie, it is said to ""feed"" off the energy of its Plates. 
[NAME] does not suffer fools gladly and will attack in a violent rampage if betrayed or deceived. It also holds long grudges if betrayed by those it considered friends. In ''Hoopa and the Clash of Ages'', it was shown to be able to stop the destruction caused by a space-time void. As shown in the JN episode ''Showdown at the Gates of Warp!'', [NAME] has the power to not only calm Dialga and Palkia, but also destroy the Red Chain controlling them. It can release countless shots of light that disintegrate the landscape around it. [NAME] can change its type at will to adapt to a situation through the use of its Plates or type-specific Z-Crystals. [NAME] also has the power to split in two, creating a piece of itself to exist outside of its realm, which is implied to be its physical form—only a piece of its whole being—while its true form is unknown and incomprehensible.

[NAME] was known to care for and safeguard the planet in ancient times, protecting the world from cataclysms such as meteors, and it would show gratitude and compassion to those who treated it with kindness. In modern times, [NAME] continues to watch over the world and wishes for people and Pokemon to work together in the face of adversity. Even when it is needed, it only gives hints on how to solve problems instead of directly interfering. [NAME] can also give its blessing to other Pokemon through bolts of light, making them bigger and more powerful, as seen with the ancient hero's 10 Pokemon companions. This blessing is passed down through family lines, as seen with the descendants of the hero's Pokemon: the noble Pokemon and ride Pokemon worshiped by the people of Hisui. 

In Legends: [NAME], [NAME] transformed a normal cellphone into an Arc Phone, a device that allows humans to communicate with it through text messages. [NAME] also has the power to appear in dreams and create a variety of Pokemon to serve as challenges, as seen in Eternal Battle Reverie. In Masters EX, through the sync stones ultimate, [NAME] can give its blessing to a Trainer it deems worthy, transforming their outfits into costumes known as arc suits. As a result, their sync pair is blessed as well, granting them a divine move over their normal sync move. In ''[NAME] and the Jewel of Life'', using its Earth, Splash, Meadow, Zap, and Draco Plates, [NAME] created the Jewel of Life, a powerful artifact capable of turning a desolate land into a rich and fertile one. 

Like the Pokemon it created, [NAME] also resides in another dimension, a realm beyond time and space itself. There, it appears in a form made of golden light, shaped like the silhouette of its normal appearance. This could possibly be its true form. It was also shown to be capable of human speech, stating that ""[NAME]"" is simply the name humans call it. The ancient Sinnoh people worshiped it, referring to it as ""almighty Sinnoh,"" ""great Sinnoh,"" and ""might of Sinnoh,"" with the term ""Sinnoh"" later on becoming the name of the region. The Diamond Clan and Pearl Clan also worshipped it, though they mistook Dialga and Palkia respectively for [NAME]. In ancient myths, it is said that the Origin Ore, an ore of mysterious power, contains the power of [NAME] itself. 

In Alola, the Aether Foundation used [NAME]'s data, collected from myths and legends from Canalave City's library, during the Beast killer project to create the artificial Pokemon Type: Full. Equipped with the RKS System, an Ability similar to [NAME]'s Multitype, it was developed to protect Alola from Ultra Beasts. However, the project was deemed a failure and was later abandoned, and Type: Full's ability was sealed with a control helmet, which caused it to devolve and be renamed Type: Null. 

[NAME] is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Judgment. It is also able to use charged-up versions of the Pokemon of myth's signature moves (Roar of Time, Spacial Rend and Shadow Force), as seen in its boss battle in Pokemon Legends: [NAME]. Additionally, [NAME] is the only known Pokemon that can have Multitype as an Ability.",Normal,,Normal,,1.0,0,"[""Normal""]",1657,73,1730
Miraidon,1008,Paradox,"[NAME] is a large, robotic, reptilian Pokemon with a primarily metallic, violet body. Its face, neck, abdomen, tail, and knee joints are silver, while its claws are white. A distinctive feature of [NAME] is the gular sac on its throat, which changes appearance across its various forms. Its head features a small, dark purple casque reminiscent of a motorcycle windshield and circular, purple cheek markings. [NAME]'s eyes resemble an LED display, with black sclerae and pupils and pixelated irises that can change pattern to simulate blinking. Each eye is bordered by two connected silver plates that resemble eyelids, from which long blue and yellow plasma-like antennae extend, resembling eyebrows. [NAME]'s shoulders are equipped with backward-curving, handlebar-like structures. A black, fender-like structure is positioned on its lower back just above the base of its tail. Each of [NAME]'s feet has three claws, with the central one marked by a vertical black line. Both its tail and gular sac have grooved surfaces, resembling tire treads. In the Pokemon Adventures manga, [NAME] is shown to possess a robotic tongue that visually resembles its gular sac.

Despite its mechanical appearance, [NAME] displays behavior that suggests an advanced level of intelligence and perceptiveness. It carefully evaluates a person's character using keen insight before deciding to accompany them. [NAME]'s calm and enigmatic nature makes it difficult to discern its thoughts or emotions, with subtle hints only visible in its eyes. [NAME] also exhibits biological traits such as the ability to consume food, specifically Herba Mystica sandwiches, to regain strength and power, allowing it to access its transformations after being weakened. Due to the smell of Herba Mystica smell on them, [NAME] can track down Titan Pokemon.

[NAME] can achieve high speeds and unleash powerful, electrically charged attacks, utilizing the advanced engine within its body to amplify its abilities, especially when surrounded by Electric Terrain. In battle, [NAME] can also race at ultrafast speeds to pierce its targets with futuristic electricity. It shares similarities with Cyclizar, a contemporary Pokemon, though [NAME] is notably more powerful and aggressive.

The origins of [NAME] in the present day trace back to a time machine constructed by Professor Turo, which brought two specimens to Area Zero a decade ago. These two individuals displayed contrasting temperaments: one was friendly and curious, while the other was aggressive and territorial. 200 years ago, Heath also encountered a [NAME] as seen in the Violet Book, though it is unclear how it arrived in Area Zero at the time. According to AI Turo, it is a futuristic relative of Cyclizar, though a version of Turo that appeared at the Crystal Pool suggests it may come from an alternate timeline. It was formerly referred to as the ""Iron Serpent"" in the Violet Book, with its current name, [NAME], attributed to Professor Turo, potentially due to a bootstrap paradox.
[NAME] has five different transformations it can change between as it traverses varying terrain and adapts to different situations. In ""Ultimate Mode"", [NAME]'s body becomes charged with purplish-yellow energy. Its gular sac inflates and glows with a bluish-white light, while its antennae flare with electricity, taking on the appearance of lightning bolts. The middle and tip of its tail also emit this energy. [NAME]'s back legs fold into its thighs, forming jet engine-like structures that enable it to hover and fly. Its legs also double as electrical cannons in this form. Its irises display a unique combination of light blue outer rings and yellow inner rings. Areas on its cheeks, arms, handlebars, and thighs are filled with light purple energy. When [NAME] enters sleep, it deactivates, causing its glowing features to turn silver. In battle, [NAME] floats to maintain a strategic position, applying pressure to grounded foes while predicting their movements and striking at their weak points. It uses electricity generated within its body to charge its claws, fangs, and tail, with one strike from its charged tail said to knock out even the most resilient opponents. [NAME] can unleash lightning from its mouth, neck, or hind legs, powerful enough to scorch the land. According to Arven, this is considered [NAME]'s true form. In ""Low-Power Mode"", [NAME] adopts a quadrupedal stance. It lacks the intense purplish-yellow energy seen in Ultimate Mode, resulting in a monochromatic silver appearance on its gular sac, antennae, and tail similar to when entering sleep in that transformation. Its irises remain light blue, and areas on its cheeks, antennae, handlebars, and thighs retain subtle light purple energy. [NAME] assumes this form when weakened or not engaged in battle. In all travel forms, [NAME]'s tail stays tucked in, and its back legs remain folded, exposing its jet engines for propulsion. In ""Drive Mode"", energy is channeled to its tail and throat, creating wheel-like rings that enable high-speed movement and cliff climbing. In ""Aquatic Mode"", the rings expand to help [NAME] float and propel itself in water, using either the rotation of the rings or its jet engines. In ""Glide Mode"", its antennae extend to spread an energy membrane, allowing it to glide or fly through the air.

[NAME] is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Electro Drift. It is also the only known Pokemon that can have Hadron Engine as an Ability.
