[NAME] is capable of freezing its own breath, and will create pathways across oceans using this technique. Should it get tired while swimming, [NAME] will also use its breath to freeze the water it is swimming in so that it can lay down and rest. Its ice breath can create fangs and claws of ice, the former being harder than steel. It inhabits northern areas where it catches prey in the cold waters. Once it captures its prey, it freezes them with its breath to preserve. It has a ferocious temperament, which has earned it the ""Snow-White Demon"" moniker.

[NAME] is a blue, rock-like Pokémon with an array of reddish-orange crystals on its back and front, and a spine protruding from between its yellow ears. Rocky chunks at its sides comprise pincer-like limbs, tipped with reddish-orange crystals similar to the ones on its back. These crystals, which are tough enough to break diamonds, are the hardened form of its endlessly leaking energy.

[NAME]'s crystals shine brightly when it begins overflowing with power or when it is preparing to fire bursts of energy. Because its crystals are valuable, with a fragment being capable of powering a hundred dump trucks, [NAME] is targeted for them. It searches for underground water in the caves where it lives; however, because it is uncomfortable around water, it is always very careful about lapping it up.

[NAME]'s mucus can cause frostbite, and is inhaled and used for its attacks, as well as smeared on anyone it dislikes. [NAME]'s mucus is also an indicator of its health.

[NAME] is a Pokémon that resembles a snail. The lower half of its body is light purple, while the upper half is a paler purple. It has featureless, green eyes, a single, tiny eyelash over each eye, and two pale green spots on each cheek. It has nubby, underdeveloped arms. On top of its head are two pairs of antenna-like horns; the front horns are small nubs, while the hind horns are considerably longer. Its gelatinous body forms a spiral shell-like structure on its back. Contained within the shell are its brain, heart, and other organs.

[NAME] excretes and coats its body with sticky mucus that can dissolve anything. Because it lacks teeth, it sprays this liquid onto prey and slurps them up once they are dissolved. Since its slime can melt through anything, predators stay far away from it. Its eyes have devolved, causing it to go blind. This makes it difficult for it to tell allies from prey and it will sometimes attempt to melt its companions. Its four horns act as a radar system and are used to detect sounds and smells. [NAME] only cares about food and will flee from its enemies whenever possible.

[NAME] is a humanoid Pokémon with plant characteristics. It dons a scarlet flower with white-spotted petals upon its head; said flower has golden filaments with red anther, resembling a crown.

One of the light green leaves, on the back of its head, is about as long as its body and resembles hair. Two light green leaves loosely hang down from its head. Its head and abdomen are white and its eyes, which resemble seeds, are a light shade of scarlet. It has dark green, linear leaves for arms, and a golden sepal under its neck. It wears a large, light green, tulip shaped collection of leaves, resembling a dress. There are two long, dark green, linear leaves coming from its back to around the bottom of its ""dress"". It also possesses another golden, sepal-shaped extension underneath its ""dress"", resembling feet.

Though [NAME] is popular with celebrities, veteran Trainers and first-rate gardeners alike have struggled to coax the flower on [NAME]'s head into blooming. The flowers bloomed by [NAME] in the wild are also said to be the most beautiful despite all these efforts. Once it blooms, it will wilt if [NAME] is then neglected or when it finds a male partner. The flower emits a sweet-smelling aroma, and it is believed to have a relaxing effect on those exposed to the scent. The flower's fragrance differs slightly depending on the soil it was cultivated in. The oil made by [NAME]'s flowers has a sublime scent and is very expensive to buy.

[NAME] is a pink, bipedal Pokémon with mammalian features. It has a rounded, wide snout; triangular ears; and large, blue eyes. It has short arms with three-fingered paws and large hind paws with oval markings on the soles. Its tail is long and thin with an ovoid tip. Its fur is so fine and thin, it can only be seen under a microscope.

[NAME] has shown a playful, childish personality, showing signs of high intelligence, curiosity, shyness, playfulness, and even selflessness. It is said to have the DNA of every single Pokémon contained within its body. This causes many scientists to theorize that [NAME] is the ancestor of all Pokémon. It is an incredibly adaptable species, capable of levitation and teleportation. It can use almost all known moves, regardless of their types. It has also shown the rare power to transform into all known Pokémon. It is capable of making itself invisible at will, so it entirely avoids notice even if it approaches people. As seen on several occasions, it has the ability to create an orb of energy around itself for protection, which can come in many colors, such as green, yellow, and pink.

According to journals found in Kanto's Pokémon Mansion, Mr. Fuji is the one who discovered [NAME] deep in the jungle and coined its name. With other scientists, he managed to gather some of [NAME]'s DNA and used it in his mansion to create a modified clone of it, aiming it to be the most powerful Pokémon of all, which resulted in the birth of the Legendary Pokémon [NAME]two. Since [NAME] can make itself invisible, very few people have seen it, leading some scientists to declare it extinct and most to assume it to be nothing, but a mirage. However, sightings of it are still being reported to this day, confirming its existence. Even though it's rarely seen, it will willingly show itself to a person who is pure of heart and has a strong desire to see it.

According to the ''Pokémon the Series''-related radio drama, ''The Birth of [NAME]two'', [NAME] was discovered by Jessie's mother, Miyamoto, who registered its cry in a forest 20 years before the events of the series. It was worshiped for its protection by ancient people who created a song in its honor and believed it appeared once a year with the rising sun. It wasn't rediscovered until 18 years after Miyamoto met [NAME] by sunrise on the peak of a high mountain. As depicted in the episode ''In the Palms of our Hands!'' it is capable of splitting itself up and transforming into more than one Pokémon at the same time. It was also shown to possess a strong rivalry with its clone, [NAME]two in ''[NAME]two Strikes Back''.

[NAME] is a plump, centipede-like Pokémon that usually stands with the front half of its body raised vertically off the ground. Its segmented body is dark magenta, except for its smooth, dark gray underside. Long, slightly bent horns similar to antennae extend from its head, as well as an identical pair of horns on its rear. Purple bands decorate these horns, and teardrop-shaped rings of the same color mark each body segment, one on each side of its body. It possesses four pairs of short, purple fore-claws on the body segments that make up its neck, which is used to inject poison. The four hind legs are longer, thicker, and spaced farther apart. Each hind limb has curved dark gray bands around the middle.

[NAME] lives in lush forests. It is very aggressive and will not give up until victorious. This Pokémon chases down enemies with great speed and then attacks relentlessly with its horns until it prevails. It latches onto the prey using the toxic spikes on its neck, and then slams it into the ground for the deadly poison effect.

[NAME] is a roughly spherical rock-like Pokémon. Its body is blue and covered in large, smooth facets. It has a hexagonal, yellow artifice in the center of its body, leading to a hexagonal opening that functions as an ear. [NAME] has a brown, rocky oblong atop its head and similar brown rocks that serve as feet.

[NAME] is born deep underground and was discovered about 100 years ago in an earthquake fissure in a layer of exposed rock. Its steel-hard body is made up of dirt from many centuries ago and it compares its hard physique with those of Geodude and Carbink. However, a sufficiently long soak in water will cause its body to soften to some degree. Inside of [NAME] lies an energy core, making its body somewhat warm to the touch. Its ear leads straight to its energy core, causing it to become angry if someone sticks their hand in there. As stated by Cilan in ''Where Did You Go, Audino?'', [NAME] has sensitive hearing and can hear sounds that are inaudible to humans. It tends to follow the sounds it picks up with its lone ear, panicking if these sounds cease.

[NAME] is a blue, quadrupedal Pokémon, with various spiny, reddish-orange, crystalline features jutting out from all over its body; two appear along its back, one on its chest, and one topping each of its four feet. Each foot also bears two claws of a similar appearance and is connected to the body by gray joints. The yellow, front-facing ears of its previous evolutionary relatives are now filled in with red and appear to have become full-fledged eyes. Several of the aforementioned reddish-orange crystals also appear on its face; three below its eyes, one in the middle resembling a crest, and two other crystals connected to the sides of its head. The stone comprising its body is extremely hard.

[NAME] compresses energy in the core inside its body, allowing it to fire attacks powerful enough to blow away mountains. When it fires these attacks at full power, the sheer force of the blast creates multiple cracks on its body. It can also store sunlight in its orange crystals, magnify it within its body, and shoot powerful energy balls that can destroy dump trucks from its mouth, though it loses this ability at night or during rain. It lives in caves and tunnels deep underground. [NAME] is a hardy Pokémon with impressive horsepower, and is a popular partner for construction workers and miners.
