Omanyte regulated its buoyancy by storing and releasing air within its shell and controlled direction by twisting its tentacles. While Omanyte fed on plankton, it was preyed on by Archeops and Carracosta. Omanyte can now be found in the wild due to being released by people or escaping after being restored to life, causing this species to become a problem.",

When full of stored electricity, it has been known to drift with the wind.\n\nElectrode explodes in response to even the smallest stimulation, simply to entertain itself, or because it has taken in too much electricity. However, unlike Voltorb, Electrode can control its explosive ability at will. This unpredictable and explosive nature has earned it the nickname of \"Bomb Ball\". Because of its appearance, many Trainers try to pick Electrode up, mistaking it for an item. As seen in the anime, if Electrode explode to defend themselves, this also results in them using up their energy and becoming extremely worn out.",

It uses this ability for hunting and keeping track of its offspring. However, this ability requires a lot of electricity to use. As a result, Luxray needs to sleep for long periods of time, sometimes into a deep sleep (as mentioned in Pokemon Sleep), in order to recover and store up more energy.

Two of these fins are on either side of its head, similar to ears; and one is directly on top of its head, resembling a dorsal fin. Vaporeon is a quadruped with three small toes on each foot and dark blue paw pads on the hind feet. Its split tail fin has been mistaken for a mermaid's in the past and is believed to be the origin of mermaid folklore. It can detect moisture with its fins, which vibrate when sensing incoming rain.\n\nVaporeon is mostly found in urban settings under the ownership of a Trainer. It is rarely seen in the wild, but it prefers clean freshwater lakes and shores. It has developed gills to become better suited to an aquatic lifestyle, and its cell composition's similarity to water allows it to melt into the water. This ability enables Vaporeon to remain camouflaged while swimming, hiding itself from enemies and allowing it to ambush its prey: fish Pokemon.",

It is even capable of briefly running on the water's surface. It can also smash through ice and plow forward using its strong arms. Poliwrath is capable of out-swimming even world-class swimmers. Poliwrath is also skilled at martial arts. It can launch powerful square punches capable of crushing boulders into dust. Many children learn how to swim by replicating Poliwrath's movement. It is one of the most gifted swimmers of all Water Pokemon.\n\nBeing the result of an Evolution via Evolution stone, Poliwrath is rarely found in the wild. When found, it is usually seen living on dry land near the water's edge, despite it being an excellent swimmer. In Alola, Poliwrath are strong enough to use the breaststroke while swimming.",

Its sky blue body has several tentacles; the tentacles toward the front are shorter and thicker than those in the back. There is a pale yellow, helix spiraled shell on its back, which serves to defend it from critical blows. Several sharp spikes line the shell's midsection from the front to about halfway down its back. The shell's rim has two circular indents where Omastar's eyes are visible. Its eyes have yellow sclerae and vertically-slit pupils. It has an oval mouth with a four-sectioned, fang-like beak.\n\nIn prehistoric times, Omastar swam the seas in search of prey. Omastar uses its highly developed tentacles to ensnare its prey before biting down with its beak, which has enough force to crush rocks. Omastar's diet includes Shellder; it cracks their shells with its beak before sucking out the contents. Omastar was in turn preyed upon by Carracosta. Despite Omastar's power and dexterity, it is slow and can only catch prey that are within reach of its tentacles. It is believed that Omastar's extinction was a consequence of the increasingly heavy weight of its shell that affected its mobility, including its hunting. Omastar is thought to be a distant ancestor to Octillery.",

It senses what kind of prey has been caught by the vibrations in the web and its preferred prey is Cutiefly. Once its prey is captured, a motionless Spinarak will wait until darkness falls.

There is also a thin tuft of white fur on its torso, which is flanked by yellow fur draping down from its shoulders. Its forearms feature long red fur resembling sleeves, and its hands and feet are dark gray with three clawed fingers and toes, respectively. A tail covered in yellow fur protrudes from its \"robe\". Its head is yellow with longer white fur on its cheeks. It has red eyes and a slender snout with a pinkish nose. Three tufts of red-orange fur protrude out of each ear. When its mouth is open, two pointed teeth can be seen on its upper jaw.\n\nDelphox carries a stick that it uses like a magic wand. When in use, the tip is set alight, and when not in use, the stick is hidden away in its sleeve-like fur. Delphox gazes into the flame at the tip of its wand to achieve a focused state of mind that allows it to see into the future. It can use its psychic power to ensnare its enemies in a fiery vortex capable of reaching 5,400 degrees Fahrenheit (3,000 degrees Celsius). Delphox uses the stick to leave burn marks on the ground. In ancient times, people used the shapes of Delphox's burn marks for divination.",

Applin also has two thin hairs on the tip of its tail, as well as two stubby forelimbs which are usually hidden inside its apple.\n\nApplin is both the lightest and shortest Dragon Pokemon, and also one of the shortest Grass Pokemon. As soon as it is born, it burrows into an apple that looks like a Leppa Berry, which serves as a home, food source, and protection against preying bird Pokemon. The apple is prevented from rotting thanks to Applin's body fluid, which also strengthens the fruit's rind. If Applin runs out of apples to eat or if it is separated from its apple, its body will lose moisture, and it will become dehydrated and weak. Since Applin hides inside an apple, it is sometimes mistaken by the frugivorous Noibat for food. In Galar, it is a custom to give an Applin as a romantic gesture. The flavor of the apple Applin lives in determines its Evolution, the apples can be exceptionally tart, sweet, or syrupy.\n\nApplin, Flapple, and Appletun are the only known Pokemon that can have Ripen as an Ability.\n",

It serves as a warning to others that Tauros is about to charge with astonishing speed. Once it starts charging, it is unable to stop or change course until it hits something. Tauros are capable of smashing through large boulders when charging. It lives and travels in herds on plains and grasslands. It will lock horns with others of its kind, and the herd's protector takes pride in its battle-scarred horns.\n\nWhile still ferocious, Tauros are calmer in Alola than elsewhere, likely due to the region's climate. It is believed that the practice of using Tauros as Ride Pokemon, which is done to this day, originated in Alola.

Its eyes are red with blue sclerae, and there is one eyelash over each eye. Its long tentacles have white edges, while its short tentacles have white spots. A female is pink with a tall white crown and a puffy white collar. Its eyes are blue with red sclerae and surrounded by two eyelashes. Just below its eyes is a red heart-shaped marking which resembles a mouth. The long tentacles have white edges like the male, but the short ones have white frills.\n\nJellicent can absorb seawater and project it from its head, which lets it move forward in the sea. Jellicent's body composition is similar to seawater. Schools of Jellicent are known to gather for prey during a full moon. Any fancy cruise ships, tankers, or crew that wander into the oceans where it dwells are never found again, and it is rumored that it drags these ships or tankers into the sea and preys on its passengers. It can create lairs from sunken ships. It is known to feed on life energy, where the more it drains, the bigger its crown gets. Jellicent are highly feared by fishers.",

Its eyes seem to remain open even when it is asleep. Whenever it is seen with its mouth open, an orange glow emanates from inside it. Boiling, magma-like blood circulates through its body. While its body is rugged steel, certain parts of it are partially melted, due to Heatran's own intense body heat.\n\nHeatran is believed to the embodiment of the planet's boiling core. According to legends, Heatran is said to have been birthed from the boiling magma within volcanic mountains such as Mount Coronet and Reversal Mountain. A Magma Stone is capable of both controlling and sealing Heatran within its lair. Without the power of the stone, it would rampage and cause the volcanic crater where it dwells to erupt. Heatran's claws allow it to dig deep into walls. Its feet allow it to stick to surfaces so it can hang and climb on walls and ceilings. The body of Heatran is said to hold many unsolved mysteries. Heatran has the ability to form a shield around itself in order to protect itself from harm.\n\nHeatran is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Magma Storm.",

A person whose dream was eaten by a Munna will forget the dream's contents. It has been observed eating the dreams of Pokemon and humans even while it sleeps.

Munna can also seek out and cure people and Pokemon who are having nightmares by eating their dreams; the Dream Mist extracted from a nightmare will be black in color.

It protects Snover from packs of Galarian Darumaka, who chase them for the Berries they grow, by swinging its arms like hammers. Abomasnow is powerful enough to split huge boulders in two. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, a sleeping Abomasnow can still cause blizzards by occasionally swinging its arms. Researchers acknowledged that it is unknown why Abomasnow does this, though it is theorized that it is either a habit to hide itself or just sleepy flailing.\n\nPrior to Generation VI, Abomasnow and its pre-evolved form, Snover, were the only known Pokemon that could have Snow Warning as an Ability.",

On either side of its main body is a smaller mound reminiscent of a stubby arm.\n\nSandygast is known to inhabit beaches, and is born from grudges that seep into the sand, such as from Pokemon that suffer defeat in battle or the deceased. It can suck the life force of people or Pokemon through its mouth. Apparently, in the Alola region, sticking a hand into Sandygast's mouth is a way of proving one's courage. A person who grabs Sandygast's shovel or puts a hand in its mouth falls under its control. Sandygast uses this power to make children add sand to its body so it can become bigger. Sandygast cares a lot about the shovel on its head. A Sandygast that loses its shovel may replace it with something like a branch or a flag, but it is said to keep searching for its lost shovel. Sandygast attacks prey by flinging sand into their eyes; however, because Sandygast is very slow, its prey tend to escape before it can approach them.\n\nSandygast and its evolved form, Palossand, are the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Shore Up.

It bears a strong resemblance to Tyranitar, although it is said to be coolheaded and prefers to avoid unnecessary fights. It appears to be highly intelligent and is speculated to be a Tyranitar as it would appear 1,000,000,000 years in the future. Its name is said to come from a similarly described entity appearing in the Violet Book. When it falls asleep, it turns itself off, causing the green energy on its torso, legs, tail, and spikes to turn black.\n\nAccording to AI Turo, Iron Thorns is an future Pokemon related to Tyranitar. However, according to a version of Professor Turo that appeared at the Crystal Pool, Iron Thorns is a counterpart of Tyranitar from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. Iron Thorns was brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Turo ten years ago. 200 years ago, Heath also encountered Iron Thorns, as seen in the Violet Book, though it is unclear how it arrived there at the time.-",

As its green spheres dry out, their dull luster increases. It can remain in the same spot for a long time. It also has a habit of crying, not because it is sad or needing attention, but rather it is due to excess moisture in its body. As it cries, it expels both sweat and tears from its eyes; Bonsly's sweat tastes a little salty, while the tears are slightly bitter. It dies if it gets too damp with this moisture. This habit also gets enemies to let their guards down. It prefers dry, rock-strewn areas, but it is not uncommon to see one in a garden. As suggested by Brock's Bonsly, a very young Bonsly needs to be bottle-fed but can eat solid food when it matures. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, people tend to think Bonsly is crying in its sleep, and that something is wrong.

Weavile travel in packs of four or five, with one of them acting as the pack leader. They hunt for prey such as Alolan Sandshrew, Alolan Vulpix, and species as large as Mamoswine, then divide up the prey amongst themselves. Weavile can communicate with each other by carving patterns into trees, ice, and boulders, with over 500 distinct signs recorded.

The tail consists of four large, blue fins with pink ovals in their centers. Each of the tail fins overlaps the next slightly, causing it to resemble a fan. Milotic's scales are said to change color depending on the viewing angle, which has so far only been depicted in Pokemon Battle Revolution.\n\nMilotic is said to be the most beautiful of all Pokemon. In fact, it is said to have inspired many artists in their works. However, there are Trainers who prefer Feebas over it, seemingly disappointed after it evolves from said Pokemon. When there are fights going on, it has the power to calm angry feelings and end arguments by releasing a wave of energy. In addition, it can move by floating in the air as shown in the twelfth Pokemon movie.

At night, Morelull can make the spores filling its mushroom caps glow.\n\nMorelull likes dark, damp areas such as dense jungles, but changes locations every night to avoid depriving the plants in any one area of too many nutrients. In addition to locomotion, its roots are also used to communicate with other Morelull. When in danger, it scatters spores that burst into bright, glittering sparks. The pulsing light of the spores can induce drowsiness. It is rumored that once when a group of Morelull were disturbed and all threw out their spores at once, a plane passing overhead suffered a near brush with disaster..

It has four legs, each of which ends in a single white claw. Its long, tapering tail has a white tip. This tail drips a sweet, sappy substance that is attractive to many species of fish. Slowpoke uses the tail as a fishing lure. The tail often breaks off, but it will grow back. Slowpoke tails are considered a delicacy and commonly used as a cooking ingredient: in Alola, they are often dried and used in home-cooked stews, while in Galar, they are smoked and packaged as a curry ingredient. Slowpoke is also known to dive underwater to hunt, but is often itself caught instead.\n\nSlowpoke has a notoriously dim intellect and often forgets what it was doing. It takes a long time to respond to outside stimuli. For example, it can take up to five seconds to process pain and can take an entire day to notice when its tail has been bitten. Slowpoke is commonly found at the water's edge. In some places, it is believed that Slowpoke's yawn causes rain. This Pokemon is worshiped in those areas. Its vacant expression is said to help some people relax, whilst causing irritation to others. It is posited that those who lead hectic lives are most likely to become relaxed. As mentioned in Pokemon Sleep, researchers have debated if Slowpoke is either awake or asleep while it stands around doing nothing.",

It is also very sensitive to cold, so it forms clusters with other Ledyba for warmth, and in warm regions like Alola, Ledyba seems quite lively in nature. An aromatic fluid is secreted from its feet and leg joints, which it uses for communication. The fluid indicates its location and conveys emotion; it will smell sour if Ledyba is angry. In the GS episode ''The Whistle Stop'', Ledyba is shown to serve a role in pollinating fruit-producing plants and is usually instructed to do so by means of a special whistle. However, like most Pokemon, it will also respond to regular vocal commands.

The body consists of two sections; the top section is slightly smaller and overlaps the lower. On top of its head is a starfish-like collection of ten tentacles. All of the tentacles reach the ground, except for the one directly in front, which is shorter and leaves its face exposed. The tentacles are light blue and covered in purple spines. On top of its head is a purple area with a collection of spikes with a larger, yellow spine in the center.\n\nMareanie is able to regenerate any body part overnight, except its head. The lost limbs have a very bitter, astringent flavor, and thus they cannot be eaten as food. Bruxish feeds on Mareanie, which in turn eats the branches of Corsola \u2014 except in Galar, where it has not yet learned to prey on them. Mareanie also eats broken-off Pincurchin spines, despite the risk of getting electrocuted. It uses the spike on top of its head to poison its prey and uses its tentacles to either trap its prey or deal the final blow. In the SM episode, ''The Sun, the Scare, the Secret Lair!'', it is seen attaching itself with all of its tentacles and releasing poison through its spines. The poison causes numbness and intense itching. Mareanie live in groups and are found in beaches and the bottom of oceans.\n\nMareanie and its Evolution, Toxapex, are the only known Pokemon that can have Merciless as an Ability.",

It is artificially intelligent and capable of learning new behaviors on its own, including information it does not need to know.

It is generally found in computers or in labs and other buildings working with people. It can survive in a space vacuum, though cannot move very well in zero gravity. In ancient Hisui, people were confused about Porygon2 and its evolutionary relatives due to them arriving through space-time distortions and being the product of far more advanced technology than what was available at the time.\n\nPorygon2 and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pokemon capable of learning the moves Conversion and Conversion 2.

It will rampage until it falls asleep, but its anger remains in its dreams. This causes it to wake up and become furious all over again. However, this constant release of stress grants it a long life. Mankey can be found in the mountains, where it lives in treetop colonies. If one becomes enraged, the whole colony rampages for no reason. If it loses sight of its colony or if it is left alone to rage, its loneliness causes it to become infuriated.\n\nAccording to the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team games, Mankey's preferred food is chestnuts. However, Mankey usually lacks the dexterity to peel them. It becomes agitated and rage after attempting to peel a chestnut's spiky shell.

It shares traits with Volcarona, and some theorize that it may have been revived from fossils of a prehistoric era. However, no Volcarona fossils of that era are known to have been found.\n\nAccording to AI Sada, Slither Wing is an ancient Pokemon related to Volcarona. However, according to a version of Professor Sada that appeared at the Crystal Pool, Slither Wing is a counterpart of Volcarona from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. Slither Wing was brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Sada ten years ago. 200 years ago, Heath also encountered Slither Wing, as seen in the Scarlet Book, though it is unclear how it arrived there at the time.",

Its favorite food is frozen souls. Froslass is known to bring its frozen prey back to the cave it lives in before lining them up neatly. It also goes down to human homes to knock on doors during nights of cold blizzards. There is a legend that Froslass will place curses on any men that misbehave. As evidenced in the DP episode ''The Drifting Snorunt!'', it can create illusions to manipulate others.

Its ovoid body is completely covered in yellow fur, with notable tufts sticking out on each side of its face, just over each eye, and its lower back. Joltik has four blue eyes. The two larger eyes are set relatively far apart on its face, containing black pupils. The two smaller simple eyes are situated between the first pair, slightly higher up on its face. These eyes lack eyelids and pupils, and stay open when Joltik blinks or sleeps. Joltik's mandibles point downward and reside at the bottom of its face, where they closely resemble tufts of hair. It is capable of producing silk from these mandibles, enabling it to hang from trees.\n\nAt 4 inches (0.1 meters) tall, Joltik is one of the shortest Pokemon in existence. In fact, it is too small to generate its own electricity, so it attaches itself to larger Pokemon and feeds off their static electricity. More than often it prefers sticking on Yamper's hindquarters. It will also make its way into houses and feed off electricity in electrical sockets. All of the energy it absorbs it stores in an electric pouch on its body. As seen in the BW episode ''Oshawott's Lost Scalchop!'', Joltik is not especially aggressive, but will defend itself if bothered. In the episode ''Crisis at Chargestone Cave!'', it's shown that if Joltik is unable to find a source of energy, it will be unable to move and be put in serious danger. Joltik mainly lives in caves and cities with electricity. \n",

Because it has difficulty supporting its weight out of the water, it has been known to move on all fours. However, when hunting or fighting, it is agile and fast, due to its powerful hind legs. Feraligatr can rarely be found living near the water's edge.

It is nocturnal, so during the day, it spreads its leaves wide to catch the sunlight. During the night, it spends its time searching for a new spot to sleep for the next day. It will not stay in the same spot for more than a day due to the danger involved. If anything bothers it while it is gathering sunlight, Fomantis will fiercely attack it. The reason is that Fomantis hates its naps being disturbed. When regularly exposed to sunlight, it grows up with vivid coloration. Though it excels at long-range attacks, it will rarely use those that require it to use its stored photosynthetic energy. Fomantis can give off a sweet and refreshing scent.

Prior to Generation VIII, Octazooka was its signature move, but other Pokemon could still inherit it via breeding.\n\nOctillery is normally found in oceans and caves. For a long time, people refused to believe Octillery was an Evolution of Remoraid, because of the extreme physical differences between the two. It is thought to be a distant relative to Omastar. In New Pokemon Snap, an Octillery can be seen about to be preyed on by a Seviper.",

Its body is covered with frayed-looking yellow and blue feathers designed for flight on its arms and legs enabling all four of its limbs to act as wings. All of these \"wings\" bear sharp claws. It has a ring of smaller green feathers on the ankles. Its tail is completely red and featherless except for a fan of blue feathers at the end, and as with the ''Archaeopterygiformes'', it has fully-movable vertebrae in its tail instead of a pygostyle. Its plumage is very delicate.\n\nIt is capable of flying, but is more adept at running, taking a running start to take flight with its weak wing muscles. To achieve flight, Archeops must run nearly 25 mph (40 km/h) as it builds up speed over a course that is 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) long. Archeops can hunt more efficiently when on the ground. Archeops is known to be intelligent, hunting for its prey in packs. One Archeops first corners the prey before another swoops down on it. It can outrun even an automobile. It has the intelligence to work with its partners to catch prey. Archeops are extinct but can be revived via fossils. Archeops is omnivorous; along with hunting for prey, it was shown eating fruit in the BW episode ''Archeops In The Modern World!''.\n\nArcheops and its pre-evolved form, Archen, are the only known Pokemon that can have Defeatist as an Ability.",

Its four legs and two arms are blunt and stubby.\n\nSmaller Pokemon like Horsea and Luvdisc are sometimes sheltered by Corsola's branches and even offer it protection from foes. Corsola's horn is a prized material, commonly used for jewelry and carving, as seen in the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''A Corsola Caper!''. Some people keep Corsola branches as charms to promote safe childbirth. Corsola's branches glitter very beautifully in seven colors when they catch sunlight. If any branch breaks off, this Pokemon grows it back in just one night.\n\nFound in the warm shallow waters of southern seas, Corsola requires clean water to live. If its habitat is dirty, the growths on its back become discolored and degenerate. However, when it is healthy, its growths regularly shed and grow back; it is able to regrow them over the course of a single night. It forms large social groups. Occasionally, these groups get so large that people may live atop them, as is the case in Pacifidlog Town. \n\nIn the Alola region, Mareanie and Toxapex are natural predators of Corsola, preying on its branches. If pursued by them, Corsola will sometimes snap its own branches off as a diversion.

It has yellow diamond-shaped gems on its chest and head, and three sharp toes on each foot. Its left ear has a long black and red feather that extends down to its back; it also has red and black feathers for a tail.\n\nSneasler's Evolution was the result of Hisuian Sneasel adapting to life on cliffsides in the frozen highlands of Hisui. Despite Sneasler's lanky build, it possesses great strength owing to its vicious claws. Due to its severe poison and deadly physical power, no other Pokemon species could defeat Sneasler in its habitat. Using its claws, Sneasler is capable of climbing up walls and cliffs with ease. Unlike its counterpart, Weavile, it prefers to be alone instead of living in packs.\n\nA special Sneasler is worshiped in Hisui due to her being descended from one of the 10 ancient Pokemon who received a blessing from Arceus.

Quagsire shares many similarities with its Paldean relative, Clodsire.\n\nQuagsire is carefree and sluggish by nature, although it is protective towards Wooper. An unintelligent Pokemon, it tends to bump its head inadvertently while swimming and seems not to care. It hunts for food by leaving its mouth wide open in water and waiting for its unaware prey to blunder in. Because Quagsire does not move, it does not get very hungry and can afford to wait for its food. As shown in Pokemon Sleep, Quagsire leaves its mouth open even as it sleeps.

During the day, Quagsire avoids sunlight by submerging itself in the water.\n\nIn the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''Once in a Blue Moon'', wild Quagsire are shown to have an annual celebration at Blue Moon Falls when the moon is full.

Gible is typically sighted in rocky areas, such as mountains.\n\nGible has tremendously strong jaws that it uses to bite enemies and prey alike, dragging the latter back into its nest.

Long after its passing, ancient people would dig up its well-developed skull fossil and use it as a helmet. However, because its skull grew so thick, its brain became even smaller than that of Cranidos, leading to theories that its stupidity led to its extinction. Its fossils have been found near those of Bastiodon, suggesting that these two lived in the same habitat, likely as enemies. Very little was known about Rampardos's biology in ancient times. There were records of a Rampardos that escaped after being revived and evolved, destroying a skyscraper in the process.",

There are red feathers under the sheaths that cover its sharp wings, and each feather can be moved independently. Its wings are actually hollow, allowing it to travel up to 185&nbsp;mph (300&nbsp;km/h). Its feet have three toes on them, two in front and one in back, and its tail has hooked ends.\n\nIts steel wings become tattered and bashed in from repeated battles, but once a year the battered wings grow back completely. This process restores the cutting edges of its feathers, which are sharper than any human-crafted sword. Its skin and feathers are solid due to being raised in very harsh conditions. Its nests are usually found in thorn bushes, where continual scratching of a young individual's skin will eventually harden it into the strong, armor-like state associated with its adult stage. However, water can cause Skarmory's hard body to rust easily, so it stays in its nest on rainy days. In ancient regions where these Pokemon are common, warriors would use the sharp feathers that fell off Skarmory to craft swords. It is a popular Pokemon that is used for heraldic designs, and in Galar, it has violent territorial clashes with Corviknight. In Blueberry Academy, Skarmory is used for the school's Flying Taxi service.\n\nIn Generation V, Steel Wing was its signature move, but other Pokemon could still inherit it via breeding.",

It has a single pelvic fin positioned like a revolver's trigger, two small pectoral fins, and a dorsal fin near its mouth resembling a gun's front sight. In addition, it has two caudal fins, the bottom of which resembling the butt of a gun and the top resembling the hammer. All of its fins except for the dorsal fin are white. For a long period of time, due to their vast anatomical differences, no one believed that Remoraid evolved into Octillery.\n\nRemoraid is well known for its ability to shoot jets of water out of its mouth with incredible accuracy and distance. It uses its abdominal muscles to do so, often to shoot down prey, such as Burmy, out of the air. The water attack can reach its prey from over 300 feet (100 meters) away, even when the prey is moving or flying. Because of this, Remoraid is referred to as the \"sniper of the seas.\" When threatened, it can also shoot water to propel itself backward.\n\nRemoraid tends to travel by attaching to Mantine's fins or in large groups of its own kind. It attaches itself by using its dorsal fin, which acts like a suction pad. When attached to a Mantine, it feeds on whatever the Mantine leaves behind, but will fight alongside it as well. A school of Remoraid is often seen working together and traveling with a Mantyke, helping it achieve its Evolution into Mantine.

Disturbing one Beedrill will cause the whole group to attack. It flies at high speed and attacks using the large venomous stingers on its forelegs and abdomen. It will then take the victims of its attacks back to its nest for food. Beedrill nests in temperate forests and misty wooded areas.

Its thick, cream-yellow body is further protected by a gray ridge and dark gray plates on its back, jagged growths on its legs, and a plated tail.\n\nIt is from roughly 100 million years ago. Bastiodon are known to live in herds. Despite its rough, intimidating appearance, Bastiodon is a docile, caring Pokemon that feeds on grass and Berries. Its shield-like face is as hard as diamond, and capable of repelling any attack. When multiple Bastiodon line up side by side, their faces form a wall that nothing can break through; this was how they protected their young. In stark contrast to its impenetrable frontal defense, it is helpless when attacked from behind. Because its facial bones are so hard, they were initially mistaken for its spine by researchers who found its fossils.

Gastly can be found within caves and old, dilapidated buildings, but may also be seen outdoors during nighttime. Its gaseous body will dwindle away when exposed to strong winds, so they huddle together in decent-sized groups under house eaves to avoid the wind.

Hitmonlee is an exclusively male species with no female counterpart.\n\nHitmonlee's legs freely contract and stretch similar to a coiled spring (and one particular Hitmonlee can do this with its arms as well). The source of its power comes from the ligaments in its legs that Hitmonlee can fully control. This flexibility allows Hitmonlee to run with lengthy strides, giving it greater reach for its kicks. Its excellent sense of balance enables it to kick in succession from any position. Hitmonlee's kicking strength is incredibly powerful owing to its diamond-like soles. Right before kicking an opponent, Hitmonlee will harden the muscles on the sole of its foot, allowing it to maximize the full power of its kick. It has sometimes been nicknamed the \"Kick Master\". After battling, it rubs down its legs to relax the tight muscles. Rarely found in the wild, it is primarily found in urban areas. It has been seen competing with either Hitmonchan, or Hitmontop.\n\nHitmonlee has had several kicking moves as signature moves:\n* High Jump Kick (Prior to Generation III)\n* Jump Kick (Prior to Generation IV)\n* Rolling Kick (Prior to Generation VII)\n* Mega Kick (In Generation II, and from Generation IV to VI)\n\nPrior to Generation V, Reckless was Hitmonlee's signature Ability.",

A lime green mask pattern frames its eyes, and extends towards its forehead in a small bump above its snout.\n\nGrookey has two, leaf-shaped hair tufts that hold a stick on the top of its head. The stick used to be a branch from a forest where troops of Grookey lived, and it has a special power due to being exposed to the energy within Grookey's body. This energy helps Grookey's stick grow harder and more flexible. Besides using it when attacking, Grookey beats this stick rhythmically against the surfaces of all sorts of objects. This has been observed to cause grass to grow, and wilted flowers and leaves to seemingly regain their color. It enjoys being in high places, and rhythmic things such as music or dancing. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy.\n\nIn Generation IX, Grookey and its evolved forms are the only known Pokemon that can have Grassy Surge as an Ability.",

The left claw forms a single, sharp point; while the right claw is much larger and forms a more traditional pincer, with a tiny yellow lower claw and a yellow circular pattern with two stripes on the back. Each front claw has a black stripe across the top. It has a pair of yellow antennae on top of its head, yellow eyes, and three pointed mandibles. There are three black stripes along its back that separate its body into segments, and it has a light gray underside. Two black, rectangular fins form its tail.\n\nClauncher's large right claw gives it a poor sense of balance and makes it difficult to swim straight. Instead, it moves by firing compressed water from this claw. This is achieved through controlled expulsions of internal gas. Additionally, it uses this ability to shoot down flying prey and can shatter rock at close range. It is an adept user of aura-based attacks.\n\nOccasionally, Clauncher's claws will fall off, causing it to go into hiding until the claws grow back. The meat inside its claws is said to be delicious; however, it has a characteristic taste that is not universally loved. Clauncher's claws are a popular delicacy in places like Galar and Paldea.  Dreepy is known to bite on Clauncher, although it does not actually feed on them; this is said to be a behavior carried over from when the Dreepy was alive.\n\nFrom Generation VIII onward, Clauncher and its evolved form, Clawitzer, are the only known Pokemon that can have Mega Launcher as an Ability.",

Zeraora has large ears with black insides and blue eyes. Its forepaws have four clawed fingers and light blue pads, while its hindpaws have only three clawed toes.\n\nZeraora was supposedly born from an explosion caused by a bolt of lightning striking an erupting volcano. It lacks an electricity-generating organ, so it gathers and stores electricity from outside sources. This Pokemon can create a very powerful magnetic field through the strong electric currents emitted from its paw pads. Using this magnetic field allows it to levitate and move at high speeds while airborne. Zeraora can travel as fast as a lightning strike. Its fur is known to stand on end whenever it is using massive amounts of electricity. Zeraora can tear its opponents apart with its high-voltage claws. Even if the opponent dodges, they can still get electrocuted by the flying sparks. Lightning flashes and thunderclaps can occur when Zeraora starts running.

In the fifth movie, in Pokemon Adventures, and in JN, Latios had the ability \"Sight Sharing\", which allowed Latias and people around it to see exactly what Latios was seeing. Oakley also mentioned that it can shape-shift. It prefers compassionate Trainers, to whom it opens its heart. Latios uses telepathy to detect locations and the emotions of others and can understand human speech. It can summon explosive light energy whenever an offensive situation is required.

It has a growth of green fur-like leaves on its neck, which extends at the front and droops down to its hips, resembling a poncho. Dark green colorations adorn the lower part of this neck fur, along with its hands, feet, and face; the latter is patterned to resemble a mask. Its face also has pink eyes and a small pink nose. Floragato's fur can change in hardness depending on its mood \u2014 its fur becomes sharp as needles when it is ready to battle. Each of its hands and feet has a round, pink paw pad and three digits, with visible claws on its fingers.\n\nThere is a vine tucked inside Floragato's fur \u2014 which has a hard, round, visible pink flower bud on the end, acting similarly to a boutonni\u00e8re. Floragato wields the vine and swings the bud to attack its opponents. In HZ, the vines can be used to pull others towards Floragato and even knock off objects held by other Pokemon. The bud additionally can be used for its entertainment as a yo-yo. When not in use, the bud is kept on the left side of Floragato's chest, near its neck. As mentioned in the Sleep Style Dex, Floragato plays with the bud while sleeping. Floragato is intelligent and dexterous. It is also mischievous and likes showing off, desiring attention and companionship from others. If its Trainer refuses to give it attention, Floragato may misbehave by pulling pranks, such as tying the Trainer with its vine while they are asleep. \n",

Magmar's shoulders and thighs are yellow, and its red feet have two, clawed toes each. It has black, metal shackles around its neck and ankles.

Because it hates cold places, this Pokemon typically resides in and around active volcanoes where it is born from. This Pokemon has even been known to spit scorching flames to establish an ideally warm environment for itself. The Magmar found in Alola are said to be sturdier than Magmar found elsewhere.\n\nIn battle, Magmar blows out intense flames from all over its body to intimidate its foes and incinerate its surroundings. The ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''Riddle Me This'' has shown that extremely well-trained Magmar can block Electric attacks with super-heated air. However, an outmatched Magmar will quickly retreat, using its fiery camouflage and its wavering, rippling glare to blend into any present fires. As stated in the 23rd chapter of Pokemon Adventures, Magmar is very persistent and will hunt down anyone who manages to defeat it. It is able to heal its wounds and weariness by soaking in lava.

Unlike Magneton,  each eye blinks independently of one another and not in unison. The top unit bears markings similar to tribal war paint as well as iron filings on its body and horseshoe magnets that resemble hair. The bottom units have only a single magnet each, which is elongated in a manner that makes them resemble legs; they are also covered with iron filings on their ends. Instead of floating like Magneton, it walks by bending these magnets. A series of screws with iron filings on the end floats between the two lower units, making it resemble a tail. \n\nAccording to an article from a July issue of Occulture magazine, some scientists claim that Sandy Shocks is a Magneton that has lived for 10,000 years. It has allegedly been sighted numerous times in Paldea's more arid regions, but there are no reports of it ever having been caught. It is said to have an aggressive disposition and some people who have seen it claim to have been attacked. Sandy Shocks purportedly takes its name from a beast with a matching description in the Scarlet Book.\n\nAccording to AI Sada, Sandy Shocks is an ancient Pokemon related to Magneton. However, according to a version of Professor Sada that appeared at the Crystal Pool, Sandy Shocks is a counterpart of Magneton from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. Sandy Shocks was brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Sada ten years ago. 200 years ago, Heath also encountered Sandy Shocks, as seen in the Scarlet Book, though it is unclear how it arrived there at the time.",

It has a unique organ that allows it to create \"fighting energy\" in its lower abdomen through special breathing techniques and intense focusing. Wild Kubfu live in mountainous areas far away from the Galar region, although they lived in the region at some point. According to historical texts, Kubfu used to travel to uncharted lands with people as they went to trade or explore.

It has been referred to as the \"'''secret armor'''\" of the Isle of Armor's Master Dojo, being gifted by Mustard to the one who pass the dojo's three trials. The move it masters by reading one of the special scrolls in one of the Towers of Two Fists will determine which fighting style it takes after evolving.

There is a crack across the chest of the armor, which is patched diagonally with a brown seal resembling a belt.

There is an unproven theory that Golurk contains a perpetual motion machine that creates a limitless amount of energy.\n\nDespite its large size, Golurk is capable of flying by retracting its hands into its arms and its legs and feet into its body, then taking off like a rocket at Mach speeds. It is also capable of forming a cannon by pulling its legs into its body and standing on its hands, as seen in PokePark 2: Wonders Beyond, the animated series, and the Pokemon Adventures manga. If the seal on its chest is removed, its energy runs wild, and its energy's color turns from yellow to red. This causes it to rage and fly around uncontrollably without being able to land itself. Removing the seal also causes Golurk to attack indiscriminately. A rampaging Golurk can turn a whole town into a mountain of rubble.\n\nGolurk is said to have been invented by ancient people to serve as a laborer and protector of people and Pokemon, and is sometimes used in construction projects.

Marshadow is a cautious Pokemon and can sink into the shadows to ensure it is not noticed, similarly to Gengar. While hiding in the shadows of others, it can understand their feelings and even copy their abilities. Through mimicry, it will eventually become more powerful than those it imitates. It can even learn the ultimate technique of martial arts masters it copies. As seen in the movie ''I Choose You!'', Marshadow is also capable of causing nightmares. In the same movie, Marshadow can also shapeshift and stretch out its arms. While corrupted by the Rainbow Feather, it can even take control of countless Pokemon with the power of its shadows.\n\nMarshadow is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Spectral Thief.

Gyarados's fangs can crush stones and its scales are harder than steel. Gyarados is feared for its fierce temper and wanton destructive tendencies since ancient times. In some regions, Gyarados is called the \"deity of destruction\" because of this. It appears in times of conflict and destroys the surrounding area. Its rampages have been known to last a month at a time. These rampages can occur even during a harsh storm. A Gyarados's rage won't stop completely until everything is destroyed. Some believed any human settlement is fated to be destroyed should a Gyarados appear. Gyarados lives in both fresh and salty waters. Both Gyarados and its Mega form have demonstrated in Pokemon Chronicles and ''Pokemon the Series'' that it can leap huge distances both from the water and from the ground, usually several times its own body length. However, Gyarados is rarely seen in the wild. The move Hyper Beam is often associated with Gyarados due to it being being powerful enough to instantly destroy everything it hits.",

Its yellow beak is slightly curved, and its head is supported by a broad, short neck. Honchkrow has a white and prominent crest of feathers on its chest that bears resemblance to a beard or cravat. Its wings have red feathers on the inside. Honchkrow has black feet with four toes. The tail's base is a white, cylindrical stalk, on which there is a growth of red feathers on the end.\n\nHonchkrow is known to be ruthless. With a mere cry, it can summon and organize a murder of more than one hundred Murkrow to collect food for it. Honchkrow also summons Murkrow to fight on its behalf, letting them do most of the fighting before it deals the finishing blow. The flocks of summoned Murkrow often plunge the sky into pitch-black darkness, giving Honchkrow the moniker, \"Summoner of Night.\" Honchkrow will never forgive any failure or betrayal of the Murkrow that follow it, and it will hunt and punish any member of its flock that does so. Honchkrow is more active at night, and normally spends the daytime hours tending to its feathers in solitude. It is a scavenger that lives in swamps, forests, human towns and cities, and plains. As mentioned in Sleep Style Dex, Honchkrow has been occasionally seen sleeping while guarding large number of jewels. It is theorized that the jewels it holds were gathered by its Murkrow followers. Honchkrow has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: ''Preening Sleep'', ''Roosting Sleep'', ''Gem-Guarding Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''.",

Goodra is known to be very friendly. When it grows close to someone, it will hug them and leave them coated in slime. If it is left alone, it will ooze gooey tears. Goodra usually misunderstands instructions, appearing dazed or bewildered. Despite this, many Trainers don't mind it, instead finding this behavior to be adorable. However, it will strike at its tormentors with its retractable horns and powerful tail. Goodra can become uncontrollable once enraged.

Each arm ends with a single, pointed claw from which it can spin a sticky string to create structures. There is a gray circle on each shoulder and a gray band around its abdomen. Its segmented legs each end with a large, upward-curving claw.\nGenesect was revived from a Fossil and technologically enhanced by Team Plasma to create the most powerful Pokemon ever. N had the project canceled and the P2 Laboratory closed because he felt that Pokemon, who he thought to be perfect beings, would lose their beauty if modified by science. However, Scientist Dudley kept working on it, angry that N denied his talent. This scientist reconstructed Genesect and installed the cannon on its back. According to a Hiker in Ambrette Town's Fossil Lab, there is a rumor that Genesect can be found in Glittering Cave.\n\nBy folding up its limbs and connecting its head to the cannon on its back, Genesect assumes a disk-like form known as the '''high-speed flight configuration''' (Japanese: '''\u3053\u3046\u305d\u304f\u3072\u3053\u3046\u3051\u3044\u305f\u3044''' ''K\u014dsoku Hik\u014d Keitai'', \"high-speed flight configuration\"), allowing it to fly at remarkable speeds.

It usually burrows under the surface of the sand, with only its nose and eyes appearing above ground. Due to being so close to the surface, it can move around the desert and allow the heat of the sand to regulate its body temperature. This also serves as a way of hiding from enemies. Its movement through sand has been described as being similar to swimming. When the sun sets, it burrows deep into the sand to sleep until sunrise. As seen in the BW episode ''A Sandile Gusher of Change!'', in the wild, Sandile can be mischievous and potentially troublesome to humans. However, Sandile will protect another of its species, and can be caring at times. Sandile is an ambush predator, hiding under the sand and waiting for unwary prey, such as Trapinch, to walk over it before it bites on their legs.

The larger head has a cream-colored skull-and-crossbones marking below its face, while the smaller head has a ring marking instead. It is covered with many geyser-like protrusions, which usually expel mustard-colored gases. Weezing is said to form when poisonous gases pool and two Koffing fuse over many years. Very rarely, two Koffing can become a Weezing in a short time span because of a sudden mutation. Triplet Weezing have been discovered, although they are extremely rare.\n\nEach of Weezing's heads contains a different toxin. It mixes its gases by inflating one head and deflating the other. When its gases mix, Weezing becomes more toxic and putrid. Weezing can hover in midair, presumably due to gases lighter than air, as is the case for Koffing.

Its body is specially adapted to have a hydrodynamic shape, and it has a long tail that it uses as a rudder to steer. Golduck is sometimes mistaken for the Japanese monster, and the physical inspiration for Golduck, the Kappa due to its general humanoid shape, beak, and webbed hands and feet.\n\nGolduck is a fast swimmer, capable of out-swimming even the most athletic of humans because of its webbed appendages. Even rough seas do not hamper this Pokemon's swimming abilities, and it will sometimes rescue people from shipwrecks. The TCG depicts Golduck with the ability to shoot massive jets of water form both of its hands simultaneously, using them to propel itself underwater. The gem on its forehead glows when it uses its psychic powers, and occasionally when it swims at full speed. In the past, this Pokemon was overhunted due to the belief that the gem granted people supernatural powers. As seen in Pokemon Adventures, Golduck has the ability to give knowledge to its Trainer and fellow Pokemon through telepathy. Golduck can typically be seen swimming in lakes, where it hunts fish. The prey is disabled, captured, and then brought to shore for consumption. Old tales claim Golduck punishes those who defile their rivers by dragging them in and taking them away.

Snorlax is known to appear without warning in villages and steal their food supplies, such as rice granaries, which has long been considered a disaster whenever it happens.

However, Chansey will never share its egg to those with evil hearts. The eggs become more delicious if Chansey is raised with love and care. Chansey's egg is used as a high-class cooking ingredient due to the nutrition it has. As a result, Chansey have been referred to as ''doctors' doubles'' because of its eggs. Due to its egg being over-harvested, Chansey is extremely rare in the wild and is said to bring good luck and happiness to those who manage to catch it. Fleeing from those seeking its egg has made this once-slow species much quicker on its feet than in the past. It is more commonly found in urban settings.

Sneasel feeds on Eggs, such as those of Pidgey, that it steals from unattended nests. It uses its claws to poke a hole in the Egg before slurping the contents out. It has been known to form pairs to hunt: one Sneasel will lure the parents away from their nest, while the other steals their Eggs. Although the Sneasel pair works together, they will also fight over their hunt among themselves. As a result of its Egg-based diet, Sneasel are despised by Breeders to the point where they try to drive away or eradicate the former.

It is unknown if Dusknoir has a will of its own, or if it is forced to follow the bidding of the transmissions it receives. The band on its body can open, similar to a mouth. Dusknoir is capable of using its belly mouth to swallow its target whole. It also uses this ability to take spirits into its body and carry them home or as it travels to unknown places. Dusknoir only consumes spectral essence, leaving only the empty remains of living beings untouched. As shown in ''The Truth Revealed!'', Dusknoir can eat with the mouth on its stomach.",

Swampert is semi-bipedal. It can stand on its three-toed feet with a hunched posture, and pick up or grab objects with its hands, but when moving about it tends to run on all four limbs. It has orange conical gills that protrude from round patches on either side of its face. Two large fan-like black fins extend from the top of its orange eyes to the back of its head. Similarly, a black fan-like tail fin extends upward from its hindquarters. Swampert is predominantly cobalt with a white abdomen, orange gills, and similarly orange padding on all four limbs.\n\nSwampert boasts the physical strength to easily drag an enormous boulder weighing more than a ton, batter down opponents, and swim faster than a jet ski. It can even tow a large ship while swimming. Swampert's arms are as hard as rocks. The arms can shatter enormous boulders to pieces with one swing. It has keen eyesight, enabling it to see in murky waters. Swampert also can predict storms, sensing subtle differences in the sounds of waves and tidal winds with its fins. When a storm is approaching, Swampert will pile up boulders to protect its nest. It makes its nests on beautiful beaches. The reason Swampert covers itself in mud is that it wants to keep its skin moist. It has also been seen living on beautiful beaches.As mentioned in Sleep Style Dex, Swampert has occasionally been observed relaxing in the mud before falling asleep. Swampert typically does this after exhausting all of its strength. Swampert has four different sleep styles: ''Dream-Swimming Sleep'', ''Sturdy Sleep'', ''Mud Sport Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''.\n\n\nIn Generation III, Muddy Water was its signature move.",

It has pink eyes with rounded, yellow eyebrows, short whiskers resembling a mustache, floppy ears, and a small, white beard with a circular extension. On top of its head is a mop of white hair split into four rounded sections: two draped down either side of its head. Fluffy white fur drapes the lower half of its body and conceals its arms when they are tucked against its chest. When its arms are spread, two short claws are revealed on each hand. It has a bushy white tail with a small, curved spike at the base.\n\nThis draconic Pokemon lives alone in the mountains 10,000 feet above sea level. The Berries it feeds on do not grow at this altitude, so it descends to the base of the mountains daily at dawn. Drampa is known to have a kind and compassionate personality. It loves communicating with people and Pokemon, and is especially gentle with children. It often appears in places where children gather, such as schools and parks. Mothers of the children never worry about Drampa playing with them, as Drampa is willing to protect children from any form of danger. Despite its gentle nature, it becomes enraged if a child it cares for is hurt, and can go as far as to burn the bully's house down if able.Drampa is known to stir up a gale of wind when angered, while flattening anything that gets in its way as Drampa rampages. During its rampage, Drampa's Dragon Breath attack is strong enough to demolish buildings. As seen in the SM episode ''Tasting the Bitter with the Sweet!'' and New Pokemon Snap, Drampa is capable of flying.\n\nPrior to Generation VIII, Drampa was the only known Pokemon that could have Berserk as an Ability.\n",

The absorbed metals are circulated within Meltan's body to generate electricity, which it uses as an energy source. Meltan can also use this electricity to attack by firing it from its eye. According to Professor Willow, Meltan has been described in ancient texts in the same place the Mystery Box was found. The Mystery Box was created by Melmetal's followers to store away the Meltan created after its death, until one day, they could create a new Melmetal. At the end of a Melmetal's life span, it'll rust and fall apart, however its shards will eventually be reborn as Meltan. It is known to live in groups, until the day comes where one strong Meltan absorbs the rest of the group to evolve.\n\nAs seen in the SM episode ''Show Me the Metal!'', the hexagonal nut on Meltan's body can be removed. It has also been seen working in packs. Meltan can spin its head, creating a sound that calls others of its kind. Its head-spinning can also be used as a sign of affection.

Its body expands as it collects more souls. If it explodes, the souls unleash with a screaming sound. It is also rumored that Drifloon itself is reincarnated from deceased humans.\n\nThis Pokemon is known as a \"Signpost for Wandering Spirits\" due to its aimless drifting. Desiring company, Drifloon often seeks out children and grabs their hands. However, due to how light it is, it can be resisted easily and is often pulled around. This results in Drifloon running away from any children who are rough with it. Drifloon also dislikes heavy children.

Despite this reputation, as seen in the DP episode ''Drifloon On the Wind!'', Drifloon can be friendly and helpful. In the movie ''The Rise of Darkrai'', Drifloon's body puffs up when it gets angry or aggressive. Drifloon sightings are typically more common at night.

Its arms and legs are brown and have metal shackles on the wrists and ankles. This is probably indicative of a method of training with weights. The hands have no visible fingers, instead resembling mittens or boxing gloves, and the feet have two toes.\n\nPrimeape is easily angered; even the slightest glance of eye contact will make it furious. When it becomes enraged, its blood circulation is boosted. This makes its muscles stronger, but at the cost of some of its intelligence. Primeape also possesses the ability to convert its anger into energy to attack its opponents with. It has sturdy vessels in its brain that keep it healthy despite its constant anger. It will chase anyone who upsets it and will not stop until it has caught up to its target. Even if it is awoken from sleep, it will groggily chase whatever woke it. Some researchers have a theory Primeape is angry even when inside a Poke Ball. In some cases, Primeape has been known to die as a result of its rage, though it is also said to look peaceful in death, potentially due to its rage transcending and leaving its physical form to become something new. In the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''Showdown at the Po-ke Corral'', it is shown to have a fondness for bananas. Primeape can be found on mountains.

Its body is covered in black stripes, and it has large bushes of moss growing in its back and feet.\n\nRegigigas is an extremely skilled craftsman. Long ago, it created five golems in its image and brought them to life. It used ice, rocks, magma, a cluster of electric energy, and crystallized dragon energy to create these golems. They would become known as the Legendary Pokemon Regice, Regirock, Registeel, Regieleki, and Regidrago.

Kartana's light, thin build makes it one of the lightest Pokemon in existence.\n\nKartana live in another world named Ultra Forest.

The edges on its arms are particularly in a class of their own. Any opponent who tries to attack it will be cut down with a single strike of its blades. Its thin body also allows it to evade attacks by dancing lightly out of the way. This is a very dangerous creature, considering its excellent offensive and defensive capabilities, but due to the nature of its body, it is also highly vulnerable to fire and moisture.\n\nWicke also claims that like all Ultra Beasts, Kartana stores Z-Power, the same energy possessed by Totem Pokemon, within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura.

    "bio": "Wartortle is a bipedal, indigo reptilian Pokemon similar to a turtle. It has brown eyes, a dark blue streak on each cheek, and two sharp teeth protruding from its upper jaw. It has three clawed fingers and pointed toes. On each side of its head are feather-like ears covered in pale blue fur. A brown shell with a pale yellow underside encases its body. A thick, white rim separates the upper and lower halves of the shell. An older Wartortle may have scars and algae growing on its shell. Poking out of the bottom of the shell is a thick, wavy tail that also has light blue fur and cannot be fully withdrawn into its shell. Its tail fur will darken with age. Its tail symbolizes longevity and good luck, making this Pokemon popular with the elderly.\n\nBecause it is larger than Squirtle and has a larger shell, Wartortle has a more difficult time walking on land and keeping its balance in the water. Wartortle moves its furry ears and tail as both rudders and balancing rods to maintain balance while swimming at high speeds. Air can be stored in its fur for extended underwater diving. It hides in water when hunting and emerges to surprise its prey. It's shown in the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''Beach Blank-Out Blastoise'' that Wartortle can be found living in colonies on islands. Still, its preferred habitat seems to be freshwater ponds and lakes. As shown in Pokemon Sleep, it is known to sleep with its body tucked into its shell while remaining wary of threats. It leaves its long, furry tail poking out a bit to feel out its surroundings in case of danger. Wartortle has four different sleep styles: ''Sheltered Sleep'', ''Unsheltered Sleep'', ''Flattened Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''.\n\nIn Generation II, Wartortle and its evolutionary relatives were the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Skull Bash naturally, but other Pokemon could still inherit it via breeding.",

It has extremely long, layered, symmetrical hair, far longer than its body is tall; much like a cloak, the hair on its head drapes to the ground and swathes around it to conceal much of its true body, which is adorned by a pink semi-translucent dress that gives it a much taller silhouette, resembling that of a stereotypical sorceress or witch. This hair is colored in a gradient of baby-blue, pale pink, and white from its upper portions downwards. The hair above Hatterene's head is shaped like a wide-brimmed witch's hat with a conical shape serving as the crown of the hat formation. Extending from the pointed end of the hat is a single tentacle that ends in a pink bulb and a consecutive baby-blue, hand-shaped bulb that has a trio of sharp claws, which can articulate in a manner similar to fingers, jutting out of it. Hatterene is a female-only species.\n\nHatterene has a solitary and reclusive nature, emitting psychic powers strong enough to cause headaches. This is employed as a method to deter others from approaching and disturbing it. It has also been observed that it dislikes loud noises, tearing apart perpetrators with the claws on its tentacle as a result. As shown in the JN episode ''Must Be Our Heroes and the Witch!'', Hatterene plays with people's minds and creates illusions, deceiving them for its own pleasure. Due to its long hair obstructing its floating body, Hatterene's main forms of locomotion are levitation and short-distance teleportation.

As shown in Pokemon Sleep, Blastoise is known to sleep soundly while protected by its tough shell. Blastoise has also been seen sleeping with its belly exposed on very rare occasions.

A pair of white tusks, which are smaller on the female, extend from the corners of its mouth. It has thin, elongated ears held out almost perpendicular to its body. Its four short legs are each encircled with a broken, black band and have three toes.\n\nDonphan has the ability to curl up into a ball and violently roll around like a wheel. These rolling tackles are strong enough to knock down a house. While normally calm, Donphan can become enraged and start a rampage. Once it starts its rampage, it will be almost unstoppable. Donphan will chase after anyone who angers it. The AG episode ''Date Expectations'' showed that this ability is further used as a form of courtship. The male Donphan have rolling competitions to demonstrate their toughness to the females. A Donphan's tough hide is so strong, not even a car can scratch it. Despite this, the armor is extremely vulnerable to rain.\n\nIn the PTS episode ''Roll On, Pokemon!'', it is shown that Donphan has a keen sense of smell, capable of sniffing out a gem known as amberite (Agate in the Japanese version). Donphan travels in herds with a ranking system. The larger its tusks, the higher its rank in the herd. It lives in rough, mountainous terrain. \n\nBoth Great Tusk and Iron Treads share a resemblance to Donphan. Great Tusk is theorized to be Donphan's ancestor from the dinosaur era, while Iron Treads is believed to be a descendant of Donphan or a scientific weapon sent to the Pokemon world by aliens, but according to a version of Professor SadaS/TuroV that appeared at the Crystal Pool, both Pokemon are counterparts of Donphan from parallel timelines.",

The right arm is pink, while the left is blue. Each arm has a spherical bulge near the shoulder. Its legs are shaped like white high-heeled boots with curled toes.

On either side of the ball are stars that are blue on the outside, pink on the inside, and have yellow dot-like eyes on the center. The head is not attached to the body and can be removed for use as a weapon. As seen in Pokemon Refresh, the color of the sparks and the color and shape of the stars change with Blacephalon's mood. It is known to trick its targets through the silly way it walks before blowing its head up without warning, shocking them in the process; it then steals their vitality to use as energy. Like all Ultra Beasts, Blacephalon stores Z-Power, the same energy possessed by Totem Pokemon, within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura. As seen in ''Twirling with a Bang!'', this Ultra Beast can freely move its head around easily and regenerate it after blowing it up. As depicted in the same episode, Blacephalon and Xurkitree have a rivalry with each other, often competing in contests to see who can shine the brightest.\n\nLike Stakataka, Blacephalon's homeworld is one of the only worlds which is not seen and cannot be visited riding Solgaleo or Lunala through Ultra Warp Ride.\n\nBlacephalon is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Mind Blown.\n",

Extending from the top of its head is a horn that resembles an old-fashioned key with two wide, blunt teeth. Extending from either side of the key is a thin loop that surrounds Klefki. Hanging from the loop are various keys that this Pokemon has collected. As seen in the TCG, the loop is highly mobile and can split both at the top and the bottom, allowing Klefki to collect new keys and even express its feelings. Klefki is very tiny, tying with Alolan Diglett and Meltan as the shortest Steel Pokemon.\n\nKlefki are known to be even-tempered Pokemon. In the past, Klefki inhabited mines, but when the minerals on which it fed became scarce, it moved into human settlements. It now feeds on metal ions by inserting its key-like horn into chinks in metal. It likes to collect keys, particularly master keys, and will sneak into people's homes to steal them. It collects keys to feed on their metal ions, as well as to threaten predators by rattling its collection at them. It is said that Klefki's key-like appearance is the result of an adaptation to suit its habit of collecting keys. Although it feeds on keys, it will never release a key it likes, holding onto to it for decades, so people will give it important keys as a way to prevent theft. However, on rare occasions, it will discard a key without second thought. In the past, nobles kept Klefki for generations, taking great care of them while entrusting them with important vault keys.\n\nKlefki is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Fairy Lock.

They are beloved by the people of Kitakami as heroes who once protected the land from the \"evil ogre\", and stone statues bearing their likenesses were made by the people as an expression of their gratitude right where the three had been buried. According to locals, worshipping Okidogi will grant kindness and help ensure things are 'okey-dokey' between both sides. Even with its greedy and arrogant personality, Okidogi has great relationships with its teammates, talking to each other in private and acting together to defeat their opponents. By consuming the Kitakami Mochis, Okidogi can become a Titanic Pokemon.\n\n\nIn myth, it is said that Okidogi was once a smaller, weaker Pokemon. A desire for strength led it to meet the Mythical Pokemon Pecharunt which, in need of retainers in its journey to Kitakami, used its Binding Mochi and toxic chains to tame and transform Okidogi. This resulted in the toxic chain being wrapped around its neck, chaining Okidogi to Pecharunt's will.

When Zapdos flaps its glittering wings, it releases electricity that can potentially cause thunderstorms.

Crabominable's claws can deliver powerful strikes capable of smashing ice walls or halting avalanches. In desperate times, the claws can even be fired like rockets. Additionally, Crabominable can freeze its opponents in place by firing icy bubbles from its mouth, which is useful since Crabominable has a slow movement speed.

Its eyes are reddish-orange and it has a hooked dark green beak. The feathers covering its wings and back are brown, while the rest of its body is primarily white. The three feathers at the tip of each wing are structured similar to fingers and have lighter tips. The backs of its wings and torso are dotted with many white spots, there are six on each wing. The inside of each wing has a line of upside-down, reddish-orange triangles across the top. It has long legs, feet with two toes facing forward and two backward, and short dark green talons. Its tail consists of three long, green leaves.\n\nA leafy hood covers its head and shoulders, and partially covers its face. The hood is smoothly draped across the shoulders and back, but has uneven edges. Around the head, the hood forms many pointed projections that extend over its face. A single white feather with a reddish-orange base extends from the top of its hood. In the center of its chest is a reddish-orange X shape formed by dead leaves. Extending from its hood are two vines that, when pulled, close the hood further over Decidueye's face and improves its focus. The vines can also be used as bowstrings.\n\nWhile this Pokemon is cool and cautious by nature, it begins to panic if surprised. It can hide from opponents by masking its presence, allowing it to attack unaware foes. It takes only a tenth of a second for it to pluck, aim, and fire an arrow quill from its wings. It is not only quick but also accurate, capable of striking targets over half a mile away.\n\nAlolan Decidueye is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Spirit Shackle. It is also the only known Pokemon capable of using the Z-Move Sinister Arrow Raid. Additionally, Alolan Decidueye and its pre-evolved forms are the only known Pokemon that can have the Ability Long Reach.",

Its front flippers are much longer than its tail flippers, although both have white tips. There are three digits on the front flippers.\n\nBrionne is a skillful dancer. While it normally learns to dance from members of its colony, Brionne can also learn to dance from humans. It works diligently to memorize each dance through imitation and gets excited when it sees a dance it does not know. It is capable of dancing in perfect time with others, even if it's never danced with them before. Large groups of Brionne can be seen dancing together on moonlit nights when the sea is calm, sometimes being led by the singing of a Primarina. Brionne has a caring nature; if its Trainer is feeling down, it will perform a dance to cheer them up.\n\nAs Brionne dances, it creates water balloons in a variety of colors. Its battle strategy consists of dancing while creating water balloons. The dance confuses the opponent, and during this weakness, Brionne slaps the balloons toward the target where they explode.

Its arms consist of gauntlets with large magenta blades protruding from the sides, which it can detach and combine to serve as a deadly double-edged weapon. The blades can be coated in a magical energy for additional offensive power. Its head spikes outward twice from both sides and is covered by a green curved piece resembling hair with two cone-shaped structures at the back of its head, and a teal head crest, somewhat akin to a gladiator's helmet. The centerpiece on its chest is a hollow magenta core, which can extend in order to fire ranged attacks akin to a cannon. Five petal-shaped white and green guards tinged with magenta at the ends adorn its torso, resembling a dress.\nAccording to an article from an April issue of Occulture magazine, Iron Valiant's name is borrowed from that of an object described in the Violet Book. An unproven theory claims that it is a robot built as the product of a mad scientist's efforts to create the most powerful psychic Pokemon. According to eyewitnesses, Iron Valiant is similar in appearance to both Gardevoir and Gallade. It is also said to be a cruel Pokemon, willing to take its shining blade and cut down anyone confronting it without hesitation. When it falls asleep, it turns itself off, causing the pink energy on its \"ponytails\", cannon, blades, feet and dress to turn black.\n\nAccording to AI Turo, Iron Valiant is a future Pokemon related to both Gardevoir and Gallade. However, according to a version of Professor Turo that appeared at the Crystal Pool, Iron Valiant is a counterpart of Gardevoir and Gallade from another timeline. Its true origin is unknown. Iron Valiant was brought to the depths of Area Zero by a time machine built by Professor Turo ten years ago. 200 years ago, Heath also encountered Iron Valiant, as seen in the Violet Book, though it is unclear how it arrived there at the time.",

Smeargle has a footprint on its back that is typically the same color as the paint on the tip of its tail, though Smeargle can have separate back and tail colors in Stadium 2. The mark is placed on Smeargle's back as a sign of adulthood. Smeargle also has a round structure on its head with a point that resembles a beret.

Small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw when the mouth is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three sharp claws. On Bulbasaur's back is a green plant bulb that conceals two slender, tentacle-like vines, which grow from a seed planted there at birth. The bulb also provides it with energy through photosynthesis and from the nutrient-rich seeds contained within.\n\nFirst partner Pokemon are raised by Breeders to be distributed to new Trainers. Having been raised by humans from birth, Bulbasaur is regarded as both a rare and well-behaved Pokemon. It is known to be extremely loyal, even after long-term abandonment. Bulbasaur have demonstrated a nurturing instinct towards younger, weaker Pokemon, one individual even using its vines to pick up a crying Pokemon, gently rocking it back and forth through the air while singing a \"Bulba-by\". Its vines are long and strong enough to allow Bulbasaur to grab the branches of trees and pull itself up to reach berries. Bulbasaur can survive for days without eating. As mentioned in Sleep Style Dex, Bulbasaur is known to sleep in sunny spots. Bulbasaur has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: ''Sunbathing Sleep'', ''Sturdy Sleep'', ''Vines-Out Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''.\n\nIt is found in grasslands and forests throughout the Kanto region. However, due to Bulbasaur's status as a first partner Pokemon, it is hard to come by in the wild and is generally found under the ownership of a Trainer. It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy. A Bulbasaur's bulb will flash blue when it is ready to evolve.

Similarly to its pre-evolved form, the smaller eyes lack eyelids and pupils, and stay open when Galvantula blinks or sleeps. It has two long pedipalps connected from the underside of its head, which are blue and hairless on their lower half and covered in thick yellow fur on the upper half. Galvantula's body is covered in yellow and light purple fur on top with blue fur under its abdomen. Four tufts of hair sprout from under its abdomen and grow upward. Two large tufts sprout from the left and right of the rear, while two smaller ones sprout from each side. The fur on its back is light purple and with three thick, yellow stripes running up from its rear. Despite being based on a spider, Galvantula has only four legs. Each leg is connected to the head by a blue upper half. The lower half is covered in yellow fur and forms a bell-shape over its blue, conical feet.\n\nGalvantula likes to use electrically charged silk to ensnare prey. Galvantula preys on the chicks of bird Pokemon that cannot fly, by placing electrified threads near the nests. Galvantula attacks its foes with electricity by using the fur located on its abdomen. The electricity stuns the victim which can last three days and three nights. This allows Galvantula to consume the target at its leisure. Its pedipalps are very strong, allowing Galvantula to hold down unruly prey. It also uses electric webs to defend itself from threats. As seen in the BW episode ''Scraggy\u2014Hatched to be Wild!'', Galvantula is not particularly aggressive unless provoked. If bothered, it may attack in groups.

The space on the back has only a single blue dot. There is a golden half-circlet on both the top and bottom half of its body, which divides it exactly in half.

It had the title of \"god of fields\" in Hisui due to it bringing life to the region alongside Enamorus. Its tail causes the soil to gain nutrition. The energy from the tail is created by combining lightning and wind. It possesses great physical strength and can create powerful sandstorms during combat. Landorus can also stop and calm Tornadus and Thundurus whenever the two fight or cause destruction, thus being referred to by the grateful people as \"Great Landorus\". It can be summoned at Unova's Abundant Shrine with the presence of Tornadus and Thundurus. It lives in the sky, usually around islands surrounded by water. It can unleash mini sandy whirlwinds along with surrounding itself with a wind shield to protect itself from harm. It attacks by wrapping the target in fierce winds and searingly hot sand.

The feces can be put to many different uses; in Pokemon Adventures, they can be used as makeshift landmines, exploding from a mere touch.

Zoroark has a large, red, voluminous mane with black tips, tied into a ponytail, as a teal bangle down its length separates a mass of the mane from the lower portion. It has a black ruff on its upper body, pointed at the shoulders from which its arms extend. Its upper arms are thin, whereas its lower arms, while still slim, are bulkier. The arms have spiky extensions of fur at the elbows, and it has red claws on its hands and feet. Zoroark's eyes are red-rimmed with light blue irises.\n\nZoroark can create illusions that are indistinguishable from reality, deluding many people simultaneously. It can even create illusory landscapes in the forests where it dwells, to hide its territory and protect its den. However, Zoroark is incapable of physically changing itself into another form; it is merely capable of casting illusions. When a Zoroark takes the form of a human, it is capable of human speech. It can make convincing illusions of attacks, and these illusions are extremely realistic, enough to fool even cameras and make one believe they're being physically affected, though the illusion does not have any direct physical effect. Lonely Trainers tend to use Zoroark to create illusions in order to ease their own burden of solitude. There are stories of Zoroark punishing people who tried to capture it with illusions.\n\nZoroark lives in groups, where unity is strong. It is extremely protective of those it cares about and will go to any lengths to keep them safe, including risking its own life, and it can hold grudges against those who harm its loved ones. Zoroark will hide its Zorua young in its mane to protect them and carry them around.\n\nPrior to Generation VII, Zoroark and its pre-evolved form, Zorua, were the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Night Daze. Additionally, Zoroark, its pre-evolved form, Zorua, and their regional forms, are the only known Pokemon that can have Illusion as an Ability.",

Its body is primarily dark blue, with black fur covering its necks and shoulders. Its secondary necks are also arms with elbow and shoulder joints. Despite its three heads, it is a singular entity, unlike its pre-evolved form Zweilous. Its secondary heads lack brains and do not move or think of their own accord, while its central head houses its brain. The inner fur surrounding its heads is fuchsia in color, and resembles collars. Hydreigon's heads have black eyes; the main head additionally has fuchsia pupils and visible pointed teeth, while the secondary heads' eyes are simplistic and unable to blink. Its abdomen has two fuchsia stripes and its feet appear atrophied, having no claws or defined soles. Its tail also sports a fuchsia stripe and ends with a black tuft.\n\nHydreigon is a violent, destructive Pokemon. It will attack anything that moves, determining it a foe. However, in the BW episode ''Cameron's Secret Weapon!'', Hydreigon is depicted as fairly obedient when around its Trainer. The three heads take turns when attacking, not stopping until their target is defeated. Hydreigon can also use its three mouths to rapidly eat through anything, and it is a powerful user of pulse and energy-based attacks. Hydreigon is said to be highly intelligent in spite of its constantly destructive thoughts. It is rarely encountered in the wild, but has occasionally been sighted divebombing passers-by from the sky. Many stories described Hydreigon destroying entire villages. Due to its eyesight, Hydreigon is afraid of Noivern during nighttime. It is said Hydreigon's reason for being ferocious is due to ancient people loathing it. The ancient people believed Hydreigon was evil incarnate, hence always attacking it.\n\nIron Jugulis shares a resemblance to Hydreigon. The reason is believed due to it being a possibly futuristic hybrid made from combining Hydreigon and machines together as one. It is also rumoured that Iron Jugulis is the child of a Hydreigon which fell in love with a machine.",

Its bifurcated ears are brown on the outside, yellow on the insides, and end in a distinctive curl. There is a circular yellow marking on each cheek where its electric sacs are, and it has a triangular, dark brown nose. Its arms and feet have patches of brown fur at the end, and the soles of its long feet are tan with a circular orange pad in the center. On its back are two horizontal brown stripes. Its long, thin tail has a lightning bolt-shaped end. The tip of this lightning bolt is chipped on females. Raichu exudes a weak electrical charge from its body and glows slightly in the dark.\n\nRaichu's tail is used to gather electricity from the atmosphere, or it can be planted in the ground to search for electricity. It also protects Raichu from its high-voltage power. Raichu can store over 100,000 volts of electricity, enough to knock out a Copperajah. If Raichu's sacs are fully charged, its ears will stand straight up, and its muscles will become stimulated. However, it will become aggressive if it has stored too much electricity and stress. To prevent it from reaching this state, it discharges electricity through its tail into the ground. This leads to scorched patches near its nest. Being the result of Evolution via Evolution stone, Raichu is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in forests and woodlands. The main reason Raichu is rarely seen with Pokemon trainers is because people prefer the look it had as Pikachu. As revealed in the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''Electric Shock Showdown'', Raichu is not capable of learning speed attacks upon evolving and can only learn them when they're still Pikachu. As shown in Pokemon Sleep, Raichu is known to sleep while discharging electricity, and a long tail is planted into the ground like a rod.

The fur around Passimian's head and face is longer and forms many small clumps, especially around the top of its head and under its chin. On top of its head is a pale green helmet similar to half of a coconut shell. The helmet has a small orange blaze on the front and two leaves that stand up straight attached to the back. Its eyes are partially hidden by its headwear, but its yellow sclerae and reddish-orange irises are visible. It is often seen carrying a large berry that resembles a green coconut. There are several leaves stuck on its body with saliva. The shoulders and chest all have one vertical and one horizontal leaf. While most Passimian have green leaves, it's shown in the SM episode SM064 that there is a red leaf variant on Akala Island that has one additional horizontal leaf in each area. The leaves' color and position are decided by the leader of a troop and aid in distinguishing one troop from another.\n\nThis Pokemon creates troops of 20 to 30 members. Each troop has a leader that picks 10 of the strongest members to search for food. Passimian tend to get into territorial disputes with Ambipom in their search for comfortable trees, in which they win half the time. This Pokemon's battle strategy involves throwing berries at opponents, hard ones for damage and soft ones to obscure vision, and confusing opponents by throwing the berry to other troop members. A troop's leader is the member that can throw these berries the farthest. Through rigorous training, the troop improves its coordination, teamwork, and skill in handling berries. Some Passimian are unable to handle the intensity and flee from the troop. In place of a troop leader, a captive Passimian looks to its Trainer for leadership.

On top of its head is a protuberance with a dark purple bulb at the tip. The bulb is able to open like a flower, which reveals a light blue orb in the center.\n\nThis Pokemon buries itself on the seafloor, leaving only the growth on its head exposed. By emitting a low level of psychic power, it serves as a radar to detect prey. Additionally, the protuberance can emit a strong psychic power. Opponents bathed in this power are stricken with terrible headaches and fall unconscious. Prey, which includes Shellder and Mareanie, are ground into mush and eaten. Toxapex is a rival of Bruxish in warm ocean currents.\n\nWhen emitting psychic power, Bruxish grinds its teeth, which stimulates its brain and creates psychic energy.

Its wings are as big as its body and appear to be prehensile enough to substitute for hands. It has yellow legs with webbed feet and a stubby tail.\n\nFarfetch'd is always seen carrying a leek stalk or spring onion. It carries this sprig in its wings, but sometimes chooses to hold it in its beak or feet instead. Unable to live without its stick, Farfetch'd will defend it with its life. Losing the stalk can leave Farfetch'd defenseless, and it will seek out a new one to replace it. Known uses for the stick include use as a weapon, nesting material, and emergency food source. When using the stalk to attack, Farfetch'd wields and uses it like a sword to cut through things. There are several different fighting styles involving Farfetch'd's leek. It is selective about which sticks it will use and has been known to fight over good ones. As mentioned in Sleep Style Dex, Farfetch'd will always hold onto its stalk, even when sleeping on its back in a defenseless position. Farfetch'd has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: ''Sprawled Sleep'', ''Plant-Stalk-at-the-Ready Sleep'', ''Plant-Stalk-Nibbling Sleep'', and ''Atop-Belly Sleep''.\n\nFarfetch'd is found in temperate grasslands where reedy plants grow, guarding the plants from anyone trying to disturb them. However, Farfetch'd is rarely seen, and thus it is thought that its numbers are decreasing, and that it is at risk of extinction. According to sources such as ''Pokemon the Series'' and the Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia, its population decline is caused by humans who hunted it down for food; one popular recipe suggested cooking it with its own leek. There have been attempts at breeding in order to increase the Farfetch'd population. In the Pikachu short ''Pikachu's Vacation'', Farfetch'd are shown to be able to swim like real-life ducks.\n\nFarfetch'd and Sirfetch'd are the only known Pokemon capable of using the Leek item.",

On its chest are four yellow, diamond-shaped bumps. There is a thin, yellow band around each of its leg joints and the lower, maroon portions of its legs are larger than the thin, blue upper portions. Each ankle has a short, blunt growth, while each foot has three yellow claws. Volcanion has a short, tapering tail with a slightly shorter blue bump along the top. On the back of the front portion of its body are two arm-like cannons. These cannons are normally held together and form a ring around the back. Each cannon is separated into three segments by bright blue lines and each segment has a single blue dot and a short, blunt growth. The topmost segments also have four small, yellow bumps around the ends.\n\nVolcanion has an organ that allows it to vaporize the water it absorbs instantly with extremely high temperatures. The arms on Volcanion's back expel the resulting steam from inside its body, allowing it to disappear into the dense fog. It can expel steam of superbly high pressure and has the ability to blow away mountains. Volcanion is capable of creating explosive shockwaves. This power also allows Volcanion to gouge out the earth and changing the land by reshaping it. It's said to live in mountains where humans do not tread. Volcanion can run out of water within its body to use, as depicted in the movie ''Volcanion and the Mechanical Marvel''.

Its left eye is closed with thick, mauve-colored eyelashes. It has a wavy purple mane that transitions into mauve towards the tips, with the tips themselves being translucent. Its fringe and tail are completely mauve. It has slender legs marked with a purple sock pattern. Each of its purple hooves is detached from its legs at the pastern, and the rear pair of the hooves are trailed by spectral mist.\n\nAs Spectrier desires isolation and silence, it tends to be active during the night where its energy is heightened. Its nocturnal habits resulted in it having weak eyesight, but its other four senses are keenly sharpened; this allows Spectrier to have an accurate sense of the terrain and location of living things. Its kicks are said to separate a soul from its body, and it can steal the life force of sleeping beings. It feeds on the ambient life-force it steals from others and will attack anyone who would try to disturb it.\n\nSpectrier is known to be very proud and arrogant, preferring to serve individuals it deems the strongest. It once ruled over the Crown Tundra, lording over all the other Pokemon living there and terrorizing humans who intrude on its territory. This lasted until it was defeated and tamed by Calyrex using the Reins of Unity. Spectrier has a fondness for carrots, particularly Shaderoot Carrots. It also loves Spectrier Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered it in the past.\n\nWhen fused with Calyrex, Spectrier's speed becomes swift to the point it can run a thousand miles within a single day. The strength of Spectrier's spectral power also increases. By Shadow Rider Calyrex's psychic influence, Spectrier can create countless small will-o'-the-wisps. These wisps have the power to steal the opponent's life-force with burning heat. Calyrex can also transform the steed's spectral aura into a black mass. This mass is powerful enough to absorb the life-force and souls of any being's energy like a black hole.\n\nSpectrier is the only known Pokemon that can have Grim Neigh as its Ability.",

They have a green, ovoid body, tapering off in the rear to a trapezoidal tail fin. A thick black stripe covers the top of their body from mouth to tail and a white, dorsal fin with four protrusions resembling spikes. Their lower jaw juts ahead of their upper jaw, with a small indent near the edges of their mouth. Both forms have three black dots on both sides of their body, behind their pectoral fins.\n\nThe main difference between the three forms of Basculin is the color of the stripe that separates the black and green on their body. All forms of Basculin have fins in the same places, with one on top of their body ahead of the tail fin, one below the body ahead of the tail fin, and two side fins. The Red-Striped Form has jagged fins that resemble tridents, whereas the Blue-Striped Form has smooth fins all around. The Red-Striped Form has circular, red eyes, while the Blue-Striped Form has narrower, blue eyes.\n\nRed- and Blue-Striped Basculin are extremely hostile, especially towards their opposite form. They generally start fighting each other on sight for territory. However, on rare occasions, one form may swim with the other's school. Basculin is full of vitality and reproduces quickly. When a school of Basculin appears in a lake, Pokemon other than Corphish and Crawdaunt flee. It competes with Carvanha for food.\n\nBasculin has often been referred to as \"the thug of the lake\" or \"Thug of the River\", and uses its jaws, which are strong enough to leave bite marks in iron sheets, to devour everything in its way. However, despite their fierce reputation, Basculin become prey to stronger organisms, such as Bombirdier and Dondozo. Basculin were once also consumed by humans, and were considered very delicious. The meat of Blue-Striped Basculin has an inoffensive, light flavor, while the meat of Red-Striped Basculin is fattier, and was more popular with the youth.

Most of its coat is brown with a yellow underside that extends over the top of its tail. It has an additional yellow stripe that starts on its forehead and ends between its shoulders. There are tufts of fur near its shoulders, hips, and around the base of its tail. These tufts in combination with its yellow underside create the impression of an open trenchcoat. Its ears are rounded with a small notch and are located on the sides of its head. It has a short snout with a pink nose, a large mouth full of pointed teeth that is usually depicted baring the teeth, eyes with white sclerae and black horizontal pupils nearly hidden under its yellow stripe, and tufts of yellow fur on its chin. There are three black claws on each of its four short legs. Despite its length, Gumshoos is thick-bodied and has a wide, flat tail with longer fur on the tip.\n\nGumshoos hunts by patiently waiting along its prey's known travel routes and pouncing when the unsuspecting prey comes along. Due to its tenacious personality and ability to withstand intense hunger, it is able to wait for its prey for long periods without eating. Its favorite prey are the Alolan forms of Rattata and Raticate, but since Gumshoos is diurnal, it rarely encounters them. It is also known to prey on Skwovet, which does not provide Gumshoos much challenge. Once the sun sets, this Pokemon's stamina is depleted and it will fall asleep where it stands.

These wings, especially its back wing, release shining particles and undulate beautifully around the quarter moon. It has paw-like protrusions resting on its chest. Cresselia generally floats in the air, but may rest on the floor when it is injured.\n\nDue to its appearance, Cresselia is said to resemble a crescent moon and the woman who made the Milky Way. Cresselia has the power to dispel nightmares, and holding one of its feathers is said to bring happy dreams. It is also great at recovery and healing techniques. Cresselia can unleash spores in the air to cause confusion on opponents while forming a shield to defend itself at the same time.

It possesses cream-colored fur on its torso and blue fur on its thighs that resemble shorts. It has a medium-length tail of the same blue color as well. It stands on its toes rather than on its entire foot. It has developed four black appendages that hang down from its head, which rise when Lucario reads or manipulates aura, a special energy that it senses; these appendages are very similar in shape and number to the four pink appendages on the head of the Being of Emotion, Mesprit. Lucario can use its powers to create a staff in the form of a bone and use it to fight.\n\nLucario can study auras to predict the movements of its opponents and track their quarry. With sufficient training, a Lucario can read auras to understand how living beings are feeling from more than half a mile (1 kilometer) away. However, Lucario sometimes ends up learning information that it would not like to know, causing it to get stressed out easily. It also has the power to manipulate this energy in an offensive manner, in the form of explosive spheres of energy. Lucario can understand human speech and has been reported to communicate with humans through telepathy.\n\nLucario is considered to be prideful and is extremely loyal to its Trainer.

There is a large, lightning bolt-shaped stripe on Electabuzz's chest, a V-shaped stripe on its forehead, one stripe on its side, a thick stripe down its back, two bands on each leg, several broken bands on each arm, and many rings around its long tail. There are three clawed toes on each of its feet, two in front and one in back, and five fingers on each hand.\n\nIn the dark, Electabuzz will glow light blue from the electrical charges running across its body. It is constantly leaking more electricity than it consumes. Being near an Electabuzz will cause a human's hair to stand on end. Electabuzz often gathered groups around tall trees to wait for the upcoming storm. During torrential thunderstorms, Electabuzz will compete to find locations likely to be struck by lightning to absorb the electric power. Electabuzz is often used as an alternative to lightning rods because it is unharmed by the absorption of electricity.

Blackouts have been known to happen when groups of Electabuzz gather to consume electricity from power plants, they often get blamed for the occurring power outages.

Rotom tend to reside in abandoned buildings. Research continues on Rotom and its ability to power unique motors. In the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''Rotom's Wish!'', a specific Rotom was shown to have the ability to time travel.\n\n",

It resembles a mysterious object introduced in Occulture as a cutting-edge weapon shaped like a Cobalion. The glowing parts on its horns can create two long bright-blue blades that can extend before bending at the end. These can be used as energy swords or be used to repeatedly launch particle blades capable of slicing any material.

When turned on, each of its heads glows blue with black eyes; the main head additionally has fuchsia pupils and visible pointed teeth formed from its armor plates.

They are blue on the inner surface and yellow on the outer surface. At the base of each mandible is a large spike and the inside is lined with short spikes. Its body is black and divided into three sections by yellow rings. The last two sections have a yellow spot on each side. On its back is a pair of wide, flat wings that are transparent with blue elytra. It has four legs; the front pair of legs has two claws, while the back pair has only one.\n\nVikavolt produces electricity with an organ in its abdomen and controls it with its huge jaws to fire powerful electromagnetic beams. Vikavolt shoots these to strike down bird Pokemon. When it clasps a Charjabug in its legs, it is able to utilize it as an extra battery. This allows it to rapidly fire its powerful beam attacks. However, during fierce aerial fights, it will release Charjabug to make itself lighter and more mobile. It is an adept flier, capable of acrobatic maneuvers such as tailspins and sharp turns. Even as it weaves through complicated tangles of branches in the forest, it is able to maintain high-speed flight. It is known to have a rivalry with Pinsir and Heracross. As shown in the episode ''A High-Speed Awakening!'', it likes to drink tree sap. In that same episode, it is shown that, in Alola, there is a competition known as the Vikavolt race, where Trainers can have their Vikavolt race for the chance to win a Buginium Z. As mentioned in Pokemon Sleep, Vikavolt's mobility is exceptional, to the point it can remain flying while it sleeps. This usually happens after intense battles, where Vikavolt used up too much electricity. In preparation for its next battle, Vikavolt will sleep upside down in order to generate electricity in its abdomen.\n\nA special Vikavolt in Alola acts as the Totem Pokemon for Sophocles's trial in Hokulani Observatory.

There is a purple stripe running down the center of its face and a purple, crystalline organ in its chest. Its white, circular eyes are set inside rectangular, black eye sockets.\n\nDeoxys was formed by the mutation of a virus from space. The Pokemon is highly intelligent; its brain appears to be the crystal in its chest. This organ is capable of firing laser beams. It was also shown the ability to morph its tentacles into human-like hands. While inactive, it can also take the form of a triangular, stone tablet. As shown in ''Destiny Deoxys'', it is able to regenerate any part of its body that it may have lost during a battle. It has also demonstrated the ability to create an aurora without changing its form. These auroras can have different electromagnetic wavelengths and are used to communicate with other Deoxys. It is also shown that the various electromagnetic waves given off by people, Pokemon, and all electronics can obscure its vision if there is enough interference with its communication. Deoxys can use powerful telekinesis in combat, and its different forms grant it further abilities and techniques to use in battle.\nIn ''Destiny Deoxys'' and Pokemon Adventures, Deoxys has been observed to create clones of itself. These clones have lifeless eyes and duller color, lack of the trademark crystal on the chest, and seem to be unable to change from the Normal Forme. Furthermore, they seem unable to morph their tentacles into hands. When these clones are defeated, they dissolve into dust-like particles. Deoxys is bitter enemies with Rayquaza, with the two often clashing with each other, as depicted in several media.\n\nDeoxys is an extraterrestrial Pokemon that was coming towards the planet inside the Grand Meteor Delta during the Delta Episode.

Its wingless body rests on two long and slender, but powerful legs with feet that have three clawed toes in front and one in back. A male has black necks, whereas a female has brown necks; both genders have brown legs.\n\nEach head has its own working brain and distinct personality. Each head represents and expresses either sorrow, anger, or joy. Despite being separate, it has the innate ability to use all three of its brains to collect data, formulate, and then execute complex plans and strategies. However, on occasion, it may overthink, which causes it to become immobilized and unable to carry out any action whatsoever. Being separate individuals on the same body, the three heads will continue to bicker until they, or at least one of them, gets to eat. This satisfies the other two heads, quelling them and temporarily ending their infighting. The strongest of Dodrio's heads and the thickest neck will become the leader and gain primary control of the body. Another form of adaptation that it has acquired is the ability to have at least one head alert at all times. Extreme caution is advised when all three heads are facing separate directions. It is in this state that it is the most dangerous and going near it may result in a severe pecking.\n\nAlong with its three heads, it has three sets of hearts and lungs as well. This allows it to efficiently oxygenate and pump blood throughout its body, thus giving it increased endurance to run vast distances without rest. It is especially prone to race vigorously across grassy plains, even in arid seasons with little rainfall. As a result, despite being slower than Doduo, Dodrio can keep running for an even longer time. As mentioned in Pokemon Sleep, Dodrio is known to usually sleep standing up.

The three long leaves each have three yellow spots near the top and three near the bottom; the markings are present on both the under and upper sides of the leaves. On top of the calyx is a growth resembling a small, purple crown with four thin yellow stripes.\n\nTsareena is known to be both powerful and aggressive. This Pokemon has a high-class nature and punishes anyone who approaches it with evil in mind. This attitude will even be directed at its Trainer if given commands Tsareena dislikes, such as being told to use an ineffective move. Touching the crown-like growth on its head is said to render it defenseless, however, and instantly calms it down.\n\nTsareena fights using finely honed kicks and graceful movements. Every time it lands a hit, it cackles at its opponent. It will even continue kicking or stepping on a downed opponent, laughing boisterously. Additionally, its sweet fragrance acts as a distraction. Because only the most powerful Steenee evolve into Tsareena, this Pokemon uses its power to protect its pre-evolved forms. Quaquaval is Tsareena's rival in kicking.\n\nTsareena is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Trop Kick.

Its arms have ties where its shoulders, elbows, and wrists would be. The upper arms have two cables, while the lower have three. At the ends of its arms are copper structures that resemble hands, each with six flat \"fingers\". The legs have ties at the hips, knees, and ankles and are composed of four cables fused together for the whole length. The feet have four toes possessing \"claws\" of exposed copper; each foot has two fused toes pointing forward and two separate toes pointing backward. Finally, its tail has three ties and four cables, one of them loose in two sections. The tail ends in what resembles a three-pronged plug.\n\nXurkitree live in another world named Ultra Plant. There, many have been seen unmoving, with their arms and legs stuck to the ground, similar to trees as they absorb electricity from the ground. Xurkitree vary greatly in size, from being a little bigger than a human to being the size of a mountain. Because this Ultra Beast reportedly raided a power plant, it is speculated to sustain itself with electricity. Witnesses claim that its entire body crackles with astonishing electrical power. According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation, Xurkitree's most distinctive feature is an organ that can generate power. This UB's bodily makeup is highly reminiscent of electric wiring, thus enabling it to conduct electricity with great efficiency. It can discharge as much as a million volts of power at a time. When it begins to run out of power, it stabs its legs and tail into the soil, entering a treelike state as it absorbs electricity from the ground.\n\nWicke also claims that like all Ultra Beasts, Xurkitree stores Z-Power, the same energy possessed by Totem Pokemon, within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura. Xurkitree and Blacephalon have a rivalry with each other, often competing in contests to see who can shine the brightest as depicted in ''Twirling with a Bang!''.",

Its large eyes contain dark irises and usually appear closed. It also has a stubby beak with a white upper jaw and an orange-brown lower jaw, and a few short tufts of feathers on the back of its head. Two green leaves curve around its face, resembling an asymmetric cut; the leaf on its right is longer than the one on the left. Under its chin are two smaller leaves that resemble a bowtie, and there are two pointed ones on its rear that form its tail. Its wings have two tan spots on the upper side and leafy plumage close to the body on the underside. Within the leaves under its wings are two sharp orange-brown feathers known as blade quills. Dartrix has orange-brown talons with two toes facing forward and one facing backward.\n\nThis alert Pokemon is sensitive to the presence of others around it, and is capable of launching attacks on unseen enemies behind it. It propels its blade quills at enemies or prey with astounding precision. By bending the feathers, it can even alter the trajectory of its strikes. However, it can occasionally miss hitting at times. Dartrix is narcissistic by nature, spending a lot of time grooming its feathers to maintain its appearance. This compulsion will occasionally lead to it losing focus when its plumage is ruffled or dirty, even retiring from battle to preen. It has been described as a bit of a birdbrain as it has a tendency to make mistakes; when it does, it sometimes tries to cover it up, which ends up making the situation worse. A Trainer who helps Dartrix through this difficult stage of its life will allow it to reach its full strength. Conversely, Dartrix will refuse to listen to a Trainer who doesn't diligently help it groom.\n\nIn Hisui, Dartrix tends to expose itself to sunlight in order to gain power, presumably due to the region's cold climate. As a result of the harsh environment, Dartrix becomes more sturdy when it evolves into Hisuian Decidueye, gaining the Fighting type instead of the Ghost type.\n\nDartrix and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pokemon that can have the Ability Long Reach.",

All 26 alphabetic forms of Unown have fully open eyes, while the two punctuation forms have half-closed eyes. Though each of its forms has a counterpart in the Latin alphabet, Unown is said to resemble ancient writing and hieroglyphs called Unown symbols. It is a mystery whether Unown predates or postdates written language, and therefore which one is based on the other. Unown can move its appendages independently like tentacles or fingers.\n\nIn the Japanese version of Crystal, a researcher implies that the Unown began appearing at the Ruins of Alph after the Pokemon Communication Center was built in Goldenrod City. This text was translated and left unused in the English release.\n\nThe Pokedex, Unown Report, and Professor Oak's research disagree on whether Unown communicates using electromagnetic waves (specifically radio waves) or telepathy. Either way, it can be detected by the Pokegear radio, which interprets it as the melody of the Azure Flute. Unown has an unknown connection to Arceus. It is said that an \"odd power\" emerges when more than one Unown come together. Certain Unown loose in the Hisui region were capable of repelling Poke Balls that contained Pokemon, preventing them from being battled. Professor Laventon's research observed that Unown resemble human writing from other lands, though no one took him seriously. In the Pokemon movie ''Spell of the Unown: Entei'', Unown is shown to be capable of reading the thoughts of other life forms. Great numbers of Unown are capable of distorting reality to suit the dreams and wishes of whoever is in control of the Unown. However, they can only do this when more Unown are present, so it could be a shared effort rather than an ability unique to each Unown.\n\nUnown is an extremely rare Pokemon that lives in its own dimension and rarely ventures outside. When it moves to the Pokemon world, Unown tends to stick to walls like engravings of ancient texts, or orbit other Unown, usually in ruins.\n\nIn Pokemon Crystal, the Unown are said to share a cooperative bond with Suicune.\n\nIn Generation VIII, Unown is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Hidden Power.",

These fur patches form pockets that it can store seeds in. On the back of its body is a pattern resembling a Pikachu's tail that extends from the bottom half of its fur. In its Full Belly Mode, its body is a creamy yellow, and its eyes are circular and black with large white pupils. The fur on the left side of its body is black, and on the right side, it is brown. A single bucktooth can be seen protruding from its smiling mouth. While in its Hangry Mode, Morpeko's primary body color turns purple, its eyes become downward-slanting red semi-circles, and its right-hand patch of fur turns from brown to black so that it matches the other side. Its mouth is also constantly formed into an angry snarl.\n\nMorpeko carries around Berry seeds that have been electrically roasted in its pockets.

Two small claws, one on each hand, serve as its thumbs, and one large nail on each foot make up its toes. It has two small spikes on its back and a short tail. On its head, Cubone wears the skull of its dead mother as a helmet. Because of this, much of its actual face has never been seen, except for its triangular, black (sometimes green or blue) eyes and a small area surrounding them, and in its Bandai Namco card a bit of its mouth, where it has a pair of a few sharp teeth and a long pink tongue. The skull has two rounded horns on the top of its head and a tooth-like point on the lower sides. Under the skull, Cubone has a brown snout. This small Pokemon survives only through the immense skill it possesses in wielding the bone it carries as a weapon.\n\nIt is called the Lonely Pokemon because of its tendency to keep to itself and avoid social situations, due to the trauma caused by the death of its Marowak mother. Cubone will often weep at night in mourning of its mother. When Cubone cries, the skull that it wears on its head vibrates and emits \"a plaintive and mournful sound.\" On the night of a full moon, the cries are said to be especially terrible. Cubone seems to recognize a likeness of its mother in the full moon, and so it howls with a particular sadness. Its cries attract Mandibuzz, its natural predator, who uses this Pokemon's bones to decorate itself and its nest. It is said a Cubone will evolve into a Marowak once it comes to terms with the pain of its mother's death. As mentioned in Sleep, Cubone is known to cry while sleeping. It is theorized that Cubone's dreams are about its deceased mother. The dreams Cubone have make it cry, but crying makes it stronger. Cubone lives in rocky areas, usually on mountains or in caves. It also once inhabited the Pokemon Tower in Lavender Town where deceased Pokemon were buried and mourned. One such Cubone's mother is shown as a ghost there.\n\nCubone and its evolved form, Marowak, are the only known Pokemon capable of learning the moves Bone Club and Bonemerang. Cubone and Marowak are also the only known Pokemon capable of using the Thick Club item. In Generations II and III, Bone Rush was another one of their signature moves.",

It has a yellow- and black-striped abdomen, which flares out from a thin, waist-like protrusion under its thorax in a manner that resembles an elegant ballgown. Underneath the expansive abdomen are seven orange, honeycomb-like cells that serve as a nest for baby Combee; the centermost cell, however, surrounds what appears to be a slender, yellow, more insect-like abdomen, which is often obscured by the \u2018gown\u2019 part of its abdomen. Vespiquen has black arms that each consist of two thin, conical segments. Each arm ends in two small, orange claws. It flies with a pair of relatively small wings, each of which consists of two stacked, translucent teardrop segments. Vespiquen's arms and wings attach to its round thorax, which is yellow on the front, black on the back, and orange on each side where its arms attach. A curved line on its back, between its orange shoulders, separates its thorax and waist. Vespiquen's head consists of its face and horns. Its orange face has intimidating red eyes; yellow mandibles that protrude from its face and connect to its horns; and a large, red gem on its forehead. Vespiquen's horns are yellow near its face and black at the tips, and with the gem, they resemble historical headpieces or crowns worn by European royal and noble women in the Late Middle Ages, such as the escoffion.\n\nSimilar to queen bees in real life, Vespiquen is a female-only species. Vespiquen is the sole queen of a hive of Combee, which it commands by releasing pheromones. The more pheromones Vespiquen produces, the more Combee it will have in its hive. As queen, Vespiquen gives birth to and raises Combee grubs, feeding on flowers to make honey for its progeny; it also controls and protects its hive. It is far more powerful than its Combee, and it will only take direct action if its Combee are unable to protect the hive; even so, the Combee will defend their Vespiquen even to the point of death. Vespiquen will destroy and feed on any outsiders it catches sneaking into its hive.

This organ can emit psychic energy powerful enough to obliterate a 10-ton truck or tanker into dust. When emitting psychic powers, the organ glows light blue.

Its eyes are green with light blue sclerae. The organ in its ears is green with a light blue ring. The tuft of fur between its ears is white and curves slightly to the side and the collar around its neck is white with several stray tufts of fur.

Iron Treads also has long black plate-like earlobes, and metal plates covering its legs, which can be retracted to aid in its rolling attacks.\n\nIron Treads is said to have a cruel nature. It is capable of swiftly curling up its body and rolling like a wheel to attack. According to the Pokecology book, Iron Treads's tire-like armor is what allows it to rotate and move around. Iron Treads will additionally curl up into this form and rock itself back and forth when sleeping. The trails it leaves behind are described as similar to scorched earth.

There are flaps on the underside of its arms, which give the impression of long sleeves. On its belly is a curved seam, which conceals a third, yellow eye with a cyan pupil, known as its \"true eye\". Additionally, Jirachi has a normal pair of ovalish eyes on its face, with small, blue triangular markings underneath. On its head is a large, yellow structure with three points extending outward: one from the top and one on either side. On each point is a teal tag, known as a \"wish tag\". A rounded extension hangs from either side of the yellow structure, framing Jirachi's face. Two yellow streamers flow from Jirachi's back, resembling comet tails.\n\nJirachi hibernates for most of its life, awakening for seven days every thousand years. It can be also awakened if sung to by a voice of purity. While it sleeps, a tough, crystalline shell envelops its body to protect itself. However, as seen in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, it can still fight while asleep. During the short periods it is awake in, Jirachi will grant wishes. However, how its wish powers work differ between canons. In the ''Jirachi: Wish Maker'' movie, M06 cannot create objects through its wishes, instead, it'll teleport the wished object to the one who wished for it. By contrast, in the BW episode ''Searching for a Wish!'', it can grant wishes without the use of teleportation. In the Pokemon Adventures manga, Jirachi will only grant wishes when its true eye is opened. Additionally, it can only grant three wishes every thousand years, which are written on each of its three wish tags. It was also shown being able to create artificial Pokemon through its wishes, animating a mass of seawater in the shape of a Kyogre. Jirachi's power is similarly exploited in the movie to create a monstrous Groudon. The movie further reveals that Jirachi's awakening is linked to the appearance of the Millennium Comet and that its third eye has the ability to absorb the energy Jirachi needs for hibernation. In Pokemon Adventures, Jirachi was shown to slumber in space. It is said that Jirachi's ability to grant wishes also gives it great attack power, as seen when it creates a concentrated bundle of light to blast its target.

    "bio": "Gastrodon is a sea slug-like Pokemon. Much like its pre-evolved form, it has a slug-like body with a round head and a mantle covering the top half of its body. It has six stubby legs and two black eyes with white pupils, with a mark imitating a third eye appearing on its forehead. A yellow stripe runs along the edge of its mantle, through its two lower eyes, and around the back of its head. Like Shellos, Gastrodon has two forms based on the sea it lives in.\n\nIn its West Sea form, it has a pair of large tentacles on its head that curve upward and a smaller, straighter pair on its neck. Its underside is pink, while its mantle is brown, with three pink spots on each side of its back. There are also two lumps on its back, resembling the cerata on real-life sea slugs.\n\nIn its East Sea form, it retains the head tentacles it had as a Shellos, which are now fully green and angled slightly further upward. Its underside is turquoise, while its mantle is forest green with two turquoise spots on each side. It has a pair of yellow, fin-like cerata on its back and a wavy yellow line bordering its side and rear.\n\nGastrodon and its pre-Evolution Shellos are examples of allopatric speciation, although the two forms can still breed with each other. It is also a relative of Shellder and Cloyster. When threatened, it oozes a purple liquid and flees. While not poisonous, the fluid is very bitter and sticky. Its mucus-coated body is soft and squishy yet surprisingly resilient, and it leaves behind a trail of sticky slime when moving on land. It also has strong regenerative capabilities that allow it to recover from injuries or dismemberment within a few hours. In ancient times, it had a shell on its back, which gradually became a thin yet hard vestigial plate.\n\nGastrodon lives in shallow tidal pools, beaches, and rocky shorelines. Its diet consists mainly of plankton, but it is occasionally known to move onto land to look for other foods, such as beach sand. When it finds prey, it melts it with mucus before eating them. While Gastrodon cannot stay out of water for too long due to its body being highly vulnerable to dehydration, it becomes more active during cloudy or rainy weather. It has been found on far-off mountains during times of constant rain. The two forms of Gastrodon are known to engage in heated conflict with one another. West Sea Gastrodon was much more numerous in the past than it is in the present. Conversely, East Sea Gastrodon's population has visibly increased in population as of late.",

Falinks usually march in a single file line headed by the brass, giving their formation the appearance of a caterpillar. This formation is known as the Column formation. However, Falinks occasionally break their formation to attack.\n\nThe six members rely on teamwork as their strategy to win battles, and constantly change formation when they fight. The five troopers follow their brass loyally, and the brass's orders are considered absolute by them. Falinks are capable of fitting into small holes, as shown in Galar, where they can be seen marching and charging through small caves and crevices. A common formation that the members change into is a form in which the troopers stand in a triangular formation around the brass, either in front of or behind it. This formation is known as the No Retreat formation, as the members stand in this formation when using the move No Retreat. In JN, the six individual Falinks are shown to occasionally stand upon one another to execute certain moves. In UNITE, it is shown that the brass may also dispatch troopers to attack on their own, with this strategy being known as the Dispatch formation.\n\nAn individual Falinks trooper has a black, spherical body with two stout, trunk-like legs. They also have blue, ovular eyes which can either be interpreted as being white or glowing slightly from their dark body. Each trooper has a golden, armored shell resembling a Spartan helmet that covers their dorsal half. This shell is topped with a red horn that continues into a small crest. The lateral sides of the trooper are protected by two horned plates resembling shields. Each of these shields features a red, central horn ringed in white. Each trooper also has a small red horn on their posterior resembling a tail.\n\nThe Falinks brass is the largest, strongest, and most intelligent out of the six members. It has a larger crest with an extendable horn it uses to attack and issue orders. The horn is supported by a golden anterior strut absent in the troopers. The brass's golden shell extends to the ventral half of its body. Unlike its troopers, the brass's lateral shields can be opposed. The brass's shields are often chipped or nicked. When Falinks is marching in formation, the brass holds its two shields in front of its face.\n\nFalinks is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move No Retreat.",

It has a square main castle for its body, two round towers for arms, and the top of another round tower with a conical point rising up from the body. A tunnel through the center of the main body creates a mouth. There is a line of five alternating blue and pink seashells over the top of its mouth, and a similar ring of seashells surrounds the central tower just below the point. The central tower has six windows: three located in the front, one on each side, and one in the back. The two outermost windows in front of the central tower have tiny pebbles in them and appear to act as eyes. The two side towers have crenellations along the top with a ring of windows underneath. Palossand's main body has crenellations around the central tower. In the peak of its tower is a red shovel stuck handle-first into the top.\n\nPalossand has the power to control the sand, and each grain of its body has a will of its own. It curses and control people and Pokemon alike, making them gather sand for it to build upon its body. Unlike Sandygast, Palossand is able to replenish any sand it loses on its own. The shovel on Palossand's head rotates when it searches for prey and is believed to function as a radar. Palossand can be found at beaches, having been referred to as the \"Beach Nightmare\"; however, it hates water. It cannot maintain its castle-like structure during heavy rainfall. As seen in the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''A Shivering Shovel Search!'', Palossand can manipulate its size to grow to the size of a building and whip up sandstorms with a swing of its tower-like arms.\n\nPalossand captures smaller Pokemon into its sandy body by dragging them down into the sand. Once they are trapped, it drains their vitality whenever it pleases, until all there is left under its body are the dried-up bones of its victims, which Palossand is able to fire from the hollows in its arms. The aforementioned ''Pokemon the Series'' episode shows that trapped victims are unable to escape Palossand's body unless it has suffered enough damage, otherwise they will be pulled back inside; it also suggests Palossand is not able to drain the life force of humans. Wherever it passes, traces of its victims' ill will are left, which are said to be the genesis of new Sandygast.\n\nPalossand and its pre-evolved form are the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Shore Up.

It also has various white-colored patterns on its head, lower jaw, neck, back, shoulders, arms, legs, and the cylindrical tip of its tail. The white coloration on the top of its head resembles a lute. Skeledirge has three black claws on each foot, and although it usually walks on all fours, it is capable of standing on its hind legs.\n\nSkeledirge's head is delineated with a black circular shape at the top. It has black eyes with yellow irises and red eyelids, serrated jaws with purple insides, and various square and triangular patterns that come in red, orange, yellow, and purple. A wreath of solid orange-and-yellow fire energy emerges from the back of Skeledirge's jaws, which circles around its head.\n\nThere is an orange fiery bird resting on top of Skeledirge's head, which is a separate, independent entity from the Pokemon. This bird is spherical, with a yellow face, white eyes, a short crest and tail, and a singular tiny pointed \"foot\" it balances itself on. It is said that the bird was born when the egg-shaped fireball Skeledirge had as a Crocalor gained a soul, which also gave Skeledirge its Ghost typing. The bird can sometimes be seen pecking at Skeledirge's jaws, supposedly cleaning its teeth.\n\nAs shown in Pokemon Sleep, Skeledirge and its pre-Evolutions are known to sometimes sleep with one eye open. The fiery bird on Skeledirge's head sometimes moves about and even plays pranks on it when Skeledirge's sleep is shallow, a behavior which Skeledirge tolerates.\n\nSkeledirge has a meddlesome but caring personality. Its singing is gentle, but powerful and full of vitality, capable of soothing the souls of all who hears it. Opponents hearing its singing will feel warm and fulfilled inside, losing their will to battle. Skeledirge burns its enemies by unleashing flames that exceed the temperature of 5,400&nbsp;\u00b0F (3,000&nbsp;\u00b0C).

Around its shoulders are segmented purple rings and its long thin arms have webbed hands with three fingers. Each finger is tipped with a purple claw. On the front of its lower body is a light blue, fin-like projection with three spikes. It also has light blue fins on top of its head that resemble long, flowing hair.\n\nTapu Fini's main body resides inside a violet shell that resembles a swordfish head when closed. The top half of the shell has a fin with light blue webbing on top and a thin, pointed spine on the front. On each side of the top shell are two C-shaped markings facing each other to form a rough circle. One marking is white and one is light blue, but both are outlined in black. These markings form the \"eye\" of the swordfish. Along the edges of both shell halves are a series of white triangles with black outlines.\n\nAs the guardian of Poni Island, Tapu Fini can freely manipulate water and it gains energy from ocean currents. Tapu Fini is both respected and feared. To avoid harm to itself in battle, it shrouds its surroundings in a mysterious fog that sends its opponents into a self-destructive trance. The guardian also unleashes this fog as a test for those who seek the special water it can create, which is said to cleanse anything unclean that it touches. Many humans have attempted this trial, including those with ill intent; disgusted by this history, Tapu Fini does not care much for humans. Despite this, it is willing to help those who prove themselves worthy. As seen in ''Run, Heroes, Run!'', Tapu Fini has shown to be able to make water clocks out of water and bridge the world of the living with the world of the dead using mist. As stated in ''Memories in the Mist!'', long periods of exposure to this mist can trap people within it forever, specifically targeting those who cannot endure the pain of seeing a deceased loved one again.

In the middle of its face is what appears to be a golden nose similar to a bull's snout. There is a white ring through the nostrils of the nose. On each side of its face is a thick white line that curves upward at the outer tip. There are red rings around its shoulders and golden, cloven hooves at the end of its arms. Its tail is mostly covered in a golden bell with two thin black rings around the top and a wavy black line around the bottom. A tuft of fur is just visible inside the bell. On top of its head is a pair of curved, black horns. Each horn has a thick yellow marking near the tip and half of a wooden shell attached to it.\n\nTapu Bulu's shell is primarily red with white and yellow markings thickly bordered by a muted black. The shell itself resembles a flower or plant when open; when closed, the horns shift to the sides and it takes on the appearance of a bull. The top of each half is slightly thicker than the bottom, which gives the \"bull\" a slightly protruding brow. At the bottom of each half is a white rectangle with a muted black triangle at the bottom.

Each of its upper arms have tan marks resembling bow-ties or butterflies, and it has two, diamond-shaped, tan marks running down its spine. The first, and larger, of the two marks begins around its shoulder blades, and the second, and smaller, mark begins below its rib cage. Rillaboom has a thick bush of green, leaf-like hair on its head, which cascades down its back; on its forehead, a single, vine-like hair, which closely resembles a music note, falls between its eyes and curls at the end, which sits to its nose's left side. On its hips on either side, it has green, belt-like adornments resembling four leaves in a row. Similar adornments with two leaf-like parts sit on its each of its shoulders near the clavicles; these adornments appear to be part of its hair when not attacking.

It has short arms with three-fingered paws and large hind paws with oval markings on the soles. Its tail is long and thin with an ovoid tip. Its fur is so fine and thin, it can only be seen under a microscope.\n\nMew has shown a playful, childish personality, showing signs of high intelligence, curiosity, shyness, playfulness, and even selflessness. It is said to have the DNA of every single Pokemon contained within its body. This causes many scientists to theorize that Mew is the ancestor of all Pokemon. It is an incredibly adaptable species, capable of levitation and teleportation. It can use almost all known moves, regardless of their types. It has also shown the rare power to transform into all known Pokemon. It is capable of making itself invisible at will, so it entirely avoids notice even if it approaches people. As seen on several occasions, it has the ability to create an orb of energy around itself for protection, which can come in many colors, such as green, yellow, and pink.\n\nAccording to journals found in Kanto's Pokemon Mansion, Mr. Fuji is the one who discovered Mew deep in the jungle and coined its name. With other scientists, he managed to gather some of Mew's DNA and used it in his mansion to create a modified clone of it, aiming it to be the most powerful Pokemon of all, which resulted in the birth of the Legendary Pokemon Mewtwo. Since Mew can make itself invisible, very few people have seen it, leading some scientists to declare it extinct and most to assume it to be nothing, but a mirage. However, sightings of it are still being reported to this day, confirming its existence. Even though it's rarely seen, it will willingly show itself to a person who is pure of heart and has a strong desire to see it.\n\nAccording to the ''Pokemon the Series''-related radio drama, ''The Birth of Mewtwo'', Mew was discovered by Jessie's mother, Miyamoto, who registered its cry in a forest 20 years before the events of the series. It was worshiped for its protection by ancient people who created a song in its honor and believed it appeared once a year with the rising sun. It wasn't rediscovered until 18 years after Miyamoto met Mew by sunrise on the peak of a high mountain. As depicted in the episode ''In the Palms of our Hands!'' it is capable of splitting itself up and transforming into more than one Pokemon at the same time.

It has three Phillips head screws on its body: two near the bottom of its body and the one on top of its head that looks similar to an antenna. The two bottom screws serve no noticeable purpose, although they may be its feet as the Pokedex identifies a footprint similar to that of the screw's head. Even though Magnemite and its evolved forms are mechanical creatures, it is shown in the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''Get Along, Little Pokemon'' that it has emotions and a way of reproducing. In ''The Poke Spokesman'', it exhibited the need to eat, although its main form of nutrition are electrical currents. It is commonly found in locations such as power plants or caves with a strong magnetic field. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, Magnemite has been depicted in carvings discovered at the Ruins of Alph. It has also been present in AZ's retelling of the Kalos war, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years.\n\nThe magnetic units on Magnemite's body generate an electromagnetic field that allows it to defy gravity and can potentially disrupt electrical equipment. The units generate stronger magnetic fields the faster they rotate. Magnemite is not known to be unnecessarily aggressive but they may approach Trainers with little notice. If a wild Magnemite is approached, it may simply flee on rare occasions, as Magnemite does not care for interaction. However, if attacked, it will retaliate with non-damaging moves. In the care of a Trainer, it can be a devoted fighter. However, as seen in the PTS episode ''The Poke Spokesman'', it's shown that it may be deterred unless a strong bond is formed with its Trainer. Should it run out of electricity, Magnemite will fall to the ground. Usually, batteries can help recharge it in order for Magnemite to start moving again.\n\nMagnemite can be attracted to anything emitting electricity or a magnetic field, including gadgets such as a Poketch. In the episode ''Sparks Fly for Magnemite'', it is shown to be attracted to electric Pokemon producing such fields. With modern electrical lines buried underground, Magnemite attacks on power plants have increased. To prevent power outages, these power plants deliberately send out signals Magnemite cannot stand to ward them off. As mentioned in Pokemon Sleep, Magnemite is known to sleep airbone by generating electromagnetic waves from its side magnets.There are rare occasions where while Magnemite sleeps and muddles to the direction of its waves, it will loop in the air while sleeping.",

Electricity can be used to receive and send messages with each other, as well as with other Electric Pokemon. It raises its tail to check its surroundings and is occasionally struck by lightning in this position. When groups grow, they can inadvertently cause lightning storms. Pikachu forage for Berries, which it roasts with electricity to make them tender enough to eat. A sure sign that Pikachu inhabits a location is patches of burnt grass. In The Electric Tale of Pikachu manga, it is depicted eating and sometimes destroying telephone poles, wires, and other electronic equipment. By occasion, it can get unintentionally swallowed by Cramorant. While startled, it looks for ways to escape from the latter.\n\nPikachu charges itself while sleeping overnight, though stress and a lack of sleep can affect this. It can release electric discharges of varying intensity. In the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''Sparks Fly for Magnemite'', Pikachu is shown to build up energy in its glands, which it will need to discharge to avoid complications. It is also able to release energy through its tail, which acts as a grounding rod, as well as recharge fellow Pikachu with electric shocks. Pikachu and its evolutionary relatives are related to Pachirisu. As shown in Pokemon Sleep, Pikachu is known to generate electricity through its cheeks while sleeping. Pikachu discharges while sleeping due to it dreaming of firing electric shots.\n\nPikachu and its evolutionary relatives are the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Volt Tackle. Pikachu is also the only known Pokemon capable of using the Z-Move Catastropika, and the only known Pokemon capable of using the Light Ball item.",

It has red-tipped, rudder-like wings on its shoulders and down its body, and similarly patterned fins on the tip of its tail. Yellow ring-like symbols run across the length of Rayquaza's body and it has an additional yellow ring on top of its head. Rayquaza has two limbs with three-clawed hands, and two long, flat, horn-like structures on its head, with two shorter horns along its jawline. It has small, yellow eyes with black pupils, prominent pink gums, and two discernible fangs in its upper jaw.\n\nRayquaza has a strong and endless desire to do heroic deeds for the Pokemon world. Rayquaza is said to be equal to both Groudon and Kyogre. For that reason, it is the only one who can halt the endless battles of the other two super-ancient Pokemon, by overpowering them and forcing both back into their slumber, even in their Primal Forms.. It is also the only one that can restore the order of nature that they've disrupted. Rayquaza is said to have lived for hundreds of millions of years in the ozone layer, where it feeds on water and other particles. There, it feeds on meteoroids, which includes Mega Stones and even Minior. It also loves Rayquaza Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered it in the past. Rayquaza is rarely seen by people; even in flight, its appearance is indistinguishable from that of a meteor. For living in the ozone layer, it can breathe in outer space.\n\nRayquaza possesses some of the strongest attack power out of any Pokemon, and can easily summon cyclones to overwhelm its opponents. It can soar into the sky and drop out into its foes at high speeds, causing huge damage. Thanks to its weather-manipulation powers, it can eliminate weather effects. Rayquaza was worshiped by the Draconid people as the savior of the region since ancient times. Thus, they built the Sky Pillar to honor it. Additionally, it can be summoned atop Sky Pillar by multiple Key Stones. In Pokemon Adventures, the Draconids referred to it as their \"Dragon Lord\". It is one of the longest-lived Pokemon species. Inside its body lies an organ that contains the same power as a Mega Stone, which was named the \"mikado organ\" (Japanese: '''\u30df\u30ab\u30c9\u304d\u304b\u3093''') by a Devon Corporation scientist.\n\nRayquaza possesses a strong rivalry with Deoxys, an extraterrestrial Pokemon that repeatedly invades its territory, with the two often clashing with each other in space. This is depicted in the movie ''Destiny Deoxys'' and in the games Omega Ruby, Alpha Sapphire, and Masters EX.\n\nRayquaza is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Dragon Ascent.

Its body consists of three orange, hexagonal sections that resemble honeycomb cells, arranged with two hexagons on top and the remaining hexagon between and below them. Each hexagon has a round, yellow face with two black, oval eyes and a black, curved mouth. In the middle of their foreheads, the upper two faces each have a single whisker-thin, black antenna with black, oval tips approximately the size of their eyes. They also each have a translucent, rounded-triangle-shaped wing connected to an orange, domed joint on their sides. The backsides of the upper faces are yellow and rounded, as the sides of a sphere. The bottom face is the main thinker of the three, and it is also the only one to have a full, insectoid abdomen. This abdomen is yellow near the tip with a thick, black stripe close to its hexagonal frame. Female Combee have red, wedge-shaped spots on the foreheads of their lower faces, just below the point where all three faces meet; male Combee have no distinct markings in this area.\n\nSimilar to other Pokemon with multiple heads, such as Dugtrio and Dodrio, Combee's trio of faces each have their own consciousness. For example, each face has a different taste in nectar, and Combee can fly only when the top two faces coordinate the flapping of their wings. Each Combee's trio of faces has been together since birth.\n\nUnlike bees in real life, the vast majority of Combee are male. However, Combee are otherwise similar to bees in their social behavior. They are mostly sociable among their own kind, and form groups of about a hundred individuals. They are generally harmless to others, as they tend to flee when threatened. From sunrise to sunset, Combee will collect nectar to create Honey wherever they can. Beautifly often provides trouble by driving away any Combee that tries to collect near it. Though Combee produce Honey for multiple purposes, they usually consume it. Each swarm of Combee makes a different flavor of honey. When not gathering nectar, Combee will protect their queen Vespiquen. They are very suggestible and will never defy the orders of their queen. When a Vespiquen feels threatened, its Combee will not think twice about risking their lives to protect their queen, to the point of aggressively attacking or even killing the threat. Combee commonly live in caves and hollow trees of forests and other natural, secluded areas with their queen. Combee sleep by creating a hive with other Combee, locking together into a tessellated wall to feel safe in larger numbers. Teddiursa and Mothim regularly raid Combee nests for the Honey they collected.\n\nPrior to Generation V, Honey Gather was Combee's signature Ability.",

Its head has a gold crown-like object surrounding it with two large horns pointing sideways. A thick black stripe runs vertically along its front with five red horizontal stripes. In its Altered Forme, it has two large black ghostly wings with three red tips on each that can resemble claws. These wings can change shape as if made of a liquid or gas. Its six legs are thick and have golden claws. Two golden half-circles similar to those on its neck are on each side of each leg, resembling shackles. It has a tail with two band-like markings.\n\nAccording to the myths and legends of the Hisui/Sinnoh region, in the beginning of existence, the Mythical Pokemon Arceus created the eggs in which the Pokemon of antimatter\u2013Giratina, the Pokemon of time\u2013Dialga, and the Pokemon of space\u2013Palkia, hatched from, all three in their Origin Formes. After the Pokemon universe was created, due to Giratina's violent nature, Arceus banished it to the Distortion World, a world that lies on the reverse side of the Pokemon world. Since then, Giratina carried a strong grudge against its creator Arceus and was willing to stand against it with the help of a human named Volo, but after being defeated by a human from another time and fleeing, it would change its ways to protect the universe from threats such as Cyrus, who had a similar goal to its former partner.\n\nGiratina is highly aggressive and territorial, likely other reasons for its banishment. It has been reported to appear in ancient cemeteries. Giratina has the power to tear holes in reality, sometimes even creating a space-time rift, being so big and powerful that it can even throw both Dialga and Palkia into a frenzy. This rift might also spread smaller space-time distortions all over the region it was created in, creating Alpha Pokemon and releasing bolts of lightning that throw noble Pokemon into a frenzy. It is also capable of cloaking itself in darkness as it attacks. It generally moves by levitating itself in the air, as opposed to walking on its six legs. Giratina is said to be equal in strength to its siblings Dialga and Palkia. \n\nGiratina is said to have observed the real world silently while in its home dimension. It remains in its Altered Forme while outside of its home dimension. Unlike in the games, Pokemon movies depict Giratina only opening portals through reflective surfaces. Giratina also had many different titles throughout the years: \"the banished Pokemon\", \"Arceus's shadow\", \"the Pokemon of Shadows\", and \"the being on the other side of our world\". \n\nGiratina is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Shadow Force by leveling up.",

Its arms are not attached to its body and instead float next to it; each arm has a small golden spike similar to those on its shoulders. It has mitten-like hands and dark pink rings around each wrist. In place of actual legs, it has a wispy tail. Hoopa has three gold rings: a large one around its waist and one hanging freely on each of its horns.\n\nIn the past, Hoopa's true power is said to have been sealed away in the Prison Bottle for the destruction it used to cause, reducing Hoopa to its smaller, weaker form; opening the bottle grants Hoopa its true form once again, but only for three days. In ''Hoopa and the Clash of Ages'', the one who sealed Hoopa's power in the Prison Bottle was a traveler named Ghris. The rings on Hoopa's body can warp space and allow it to transport items, humans, and Pokemon by passing them through its hoops. This power allows it to cause mischief and take anything it wants. Hoopa is connected to many strange events because of these mysterious powers. It stores all of its gathered loot in a secret spot only it knows. Hoopa is said to have the power to bend dimensions. It is heavily implied to be the one causing many of the Mirage spots in the Hoenn region. As seen in Masters EX, Hoopa can even bring people and Pokemon from alternate timelines. Hoopa is very fond of foods that have holes in them, especially donuts.(September 12, 2025).  \u2014 Pokemon Official Website\n\nHoopa's lair is rumored to be located inside an hidden desert oasis. This lair contains many objects and treasures Hoopa obtained over the years, claiming as its own. Hoopa's lair is believed to contain mountains of gold and silver treasures it stole from ancient kings and wealthy land barons. To the present day, no one has ever found Hoopa's lair due to how well hidden it is. Hoopa can be very vengeful to those who attempt to manipulate it for its unique power. According to one tale, it punished an organization by transporting their individual objects before moving their headquarter to the middle of the desert.

It has a pointed, beak-like snout, bright blue eyes, a black, forward-curving horn over each eye, and a thin, antenna-like growth behind each eye. A feathery gray ruff encircles its neck and billows out over its back. Yveltal's wings each have three spikes along the bottom edge near the body and five large, black claws on the tip. It has small, birdlike legs with gray talons. Each foot has two toes facing forward and one pointing backward. Its tail is similar in structure to its wings, including the five claws on the tip.\n\nYveltal has the power to absorb life energy by spreading its wings and tailfeathers. According to legend, Yveltal does this in order to power up its own energy. It is highly feared by the ancient people of Kalos because of this. Yveltal is known to appear during a conflict, draining the life energy of any person or Pokemon that it encounters. Upon reaching the end of its lifespan, Yveltal steals the life energy of everything around it, then encases itself in a cocoon and falls into a deep slumber. Yveltal along with Xerneas have the power to transform Evolution stones into Mega Stones as seen with the ultimate weapon's blast shot by AZ 3000 years ago. Both are in charge of taking care of the land in a delicate balance between life and death. Yveltal's power can be used to power up machines as seen with the ultimate weapon. It can also absorb its target's energy, restoring its vitality as a result. Said attack can also burn the ground it hits in the process. \n\nAs shown in ''Pokemon the Series'', any living creatures drained by Yveltal will turn into petrified stone, though it is unknown whether this action is intentionally malicious or not. As depicted in ''Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction,'' Yveltal can be very vengeful to anyone who disturbs its sleep and will seek to destroy it. Its counterpart Xerneas has the power to cure Yveltal's victims by filling them with life energy, but as seen in ''The Legend of X, Y, and Z!'', it couldn't undo Aila's case for unknown reasons. Xerneas is also shown capable of calming Yveltal should it get enraged. In ''Sylveon Enchants'', Yveltal was shown making plants wither away by simply touching them.

The bottom of this crest goes all the way to its neck, where it divides its face in half and creates a beak-like nose. It has small, blue eyes with yellow markings behind them. The lower half of its body is orange with four pointed projections: one short spine on the front and two short spines in the back, with one longer spine between them. These spines resemble a bird's tail feathers. Its thin arms have round, yellow structures encircling its shoulders. On each arm is a shell that appears to be half of a bird mask, and its hands end in two large claws to create a beak for the mask.\n\nThe mask itself is mostly yellow with black, orange, and white markings. There are three white triangular markings with black edges on the top of each half of the mask, which create diamond shapes when the mask is closed. The 'eyes' consist of a white diamond connected to a slightly larger orange diamond, which is inside a larger yellow diamond. Each of these shapes is edged in black. On each half of its beak is an orange triangle with a white rim. There are wing-shaped structures on each side, toward the back. Tapu Koko is able to pull the mask together and hide its upper body inside, creating the impression of a stylized rooster.\n\nThis Pokemon is called the guardian deity of Melemele Island. It's known for protecting its home, but it is fickle and will not necessarily help people in need. However, it is very curious and may come to play or battle with people or Pokemon that interest it. It is able to store electricity by closing itself inside the shells on its arms. It does this by summoning thunderclouds. It has an explosive temper, but it instantly forgets what enraged it in the first place. Due to this, Tapu Koko has been referred to as a malevolent deity should it get provoked. It can move lightning-fast in order to confuse enemies that fight it. Tapu Koko is known to defend its home from the Ultra Beasts. As seen in ''Revealing the Stuff of Legend!'', Tapu Koko and the other tapu can transform a Z-Ring into a Z-Power Ring.

Its long legs have an outer layer of black, but otherwise appear as if split from a tree trunk: their innermost sides are flat and of a woody ash-brown color. The soles of its two-toed feet are also of this color, and show matching portions of growth rings. Between the toes on each foot, two green leaves sprout, evoking the image of ''hanao'' sandal thongs. Its torso is mostly covered by a large, green, multicolored cloak-like structure that extends from a stem on top of its head. This cloak frames its face with a large, black, thorny vine, the two uppermost thorns resembling horns. The cloak appears prehensile, and its \"sleeves\" serve as Ogerpon's arms, able to grasp and manipulate objects; Ogerpon is never seen without the cloak. Ogerpon has an orange face, yellow eyes with white, star-shaped pupils and small green leaves at the edges that loosely resemble eyelashes, a three-pointed leaf that serves as hair, small black markings on its eyebrows and cheeks, and two pointed fangs in its upper jaw. Its face is usually hidden behind one of its masks, and in battle, it wields a large, spiky cudgel wrapped in ivy; these tools are stored under its cloak when not in use. Ogerpon is a female-only species with no male counterpart.\n\nOgerpon is a very intelligent Pokemon with a playful mischief-loving side. It's full of curiosity about the lives of people and other Pokemon, usually spending time with humans while wearing a mask to blend in with them in Kitakami's Festival of Masks. It is known to often cause trouble, such as by stealing snacks from the village\u2019s food supply or making off with items that caught its eye. It fights by confusing its opponents with its nimble movements and kicks, and it draws type-based energy from its masks, imbuing its cudgel with different elements. Ogerpon becomes weaker if its masks are taken away, and its full power can be restored to it by returning its masks. By using any of its masks, Ogerpon is capable of Terastallizing itself without the need of a Tera Orb, supposedly due to the masks being made of Tera crystals, just like Tera Orbs. This species is known to have a very long lifespan; one specimen is confirmed to have been alive for hundreds of years. Ogerpon is mortal enemies with the Loyal Three and their leader Pecharunt, mainly due to the group's actions towards it in the past.

A similar fur pattern is seen on Torracat's face, though now it moreso resembles an upside-down double cross: the vertical stripe extends up from its head, forming a short cowlick, and the lowest horizontal stripes tilt upwards into a V-shape above its eyes, forming its eyebrows. Its eyes have yellow irises and black pupils with a red tint at the bottom and are heavily outlined in black fur. Its ears are pointed up and have light gray fur at the base. It has a short muzzle, a tiny triangular white nose, and tufts of fur sprouting from each of its cheeks, which make up its mane. Its tail is thicker the farther away from the body and ends in several tufts of fur, giving the impression it has blown up. Its forelegs are more developed than its hind legs, capable of bending iron with a single blow. Each paw has three toes, with the front ones being larger and ending on short black claws. On its tail and legs, there are two rings of opposite-colored fur.\n\nHanging from Torracat's neck is a round, bell-like organ, which is yellow with an orange core. This fiery organ is actually Torracat's flame sac, which produces the flames it uses to attack; when it does so, the organ sometimes flares with wing-like projections to the sides. The fire bell responds to Torracat's emotions, blazing hotter according to its spirits, and rings brightly whenever it spews fire or in the heat of battle. As seen in the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''Exhibition Unmasked!'', its fire bell is also capable of absorbing flames from outside sources and converting them into its own power. In addition, Torracat's mane acts as a sensory organ, allowing it to navigate in darkness and sense hidden foes. It is also an indicator of its wellbeing, standing on end when it is in a good mood and lying flat when it is not feeling well.\n\nTorracat loves to battle, and its relentless onslaught causes others to lose the will to fight.

Incineroar usually attacks first by unleashing both ferocious punches and flinging furious kick combos and then finishing the opponent by spewing fire from its navel. It is a violent Pokemon with rough, aggressive, and egotistical behavior. It will sometimes ignore its Trainer's orders when it is not in the mood to listen. Despite this, it finds fighting unworthy opponents boring and gets motivated to fight a challenging one. Weak or injured opponents also cause them to lose the desire to fight, which others sometimes use to their advantage. \n\nIt also values the attention of the crowd as Incineroar's spirit goes up while the crowd is excited or falters when the crowd is bored. When Incineroar's fighting spirit rises, so does the temperature around its navel waist. While it tends to act like a heel, Incineroar is very happy internally when receiving the admiration of children or young Pokemon. It is also willing to help out children and small Pokemon, further showing its hidden soft side.\n\nIn Generation VII, Darkest Lariat was its signature move.\n\nIncineroar is the only known Pokemon capable of using the Z-Move Malicious Moonsault.",

Its eyes are blue with a pink line through the middle of each iris. Below each eye is a curved white line and above each is a curved pink line separated into three segments. On its upper body is another, thicker curved white line. Its thin arms have digitless hands and puffy pink bracelets on each wrist. On top of its head is a mass of dark pink, tentacle-like hair. Two longer strands of hair frame its face. Encasing its dark pink lower body and on top of its head is a shell resembling an insect.\n\nTapu Lele's shell is primarily light pink. The portion on top of its head is conical with a white diamond marking in the center and a white half-diamond marking below that. Both diamond shapes are framed in black. The shell around its lower body mirrors these diamond markings and has an additional half-diamond on the back. On each side is a hexagon marking consisting of five dark pink triangles and one light pink triangle all outlined in black. These resemble the compound eyes of many insects. There are also projections on the back of the shell that resemble butterfly wings and a small black bump on the bottom similar to a curled proboscis. When closed, the shell resembles a bug's head with small wings. Tapu Lele's strength is derived from the vital energy stored within its shell.\n\nThe people of Akala Island worship Tapu Lele as their guardian deity. It is known to scatter glowing scales, which affect others by stimulating and healing their bodies; however, these scales are also dangerous if too many are touched at once. Tapu Lele is sometimes described as cruel for the way it weakens others as it scatters its scales for its own amusement. This indifferent disposition has earned Tapu Lele the moniker \"nature incarnate\". An old legend recounts that Tapu Lele ended a war between Alola's islands by healing the tired warriors with its scales, but some accounts point to a more disturbing truth behind this story. If Tapu Lele finds itself at a disadvantage during battle, it focuses on avoiding an outright loss rather than seeking a decisive victory. It is said to gain energy from the scent of flowers. Tapu Lele is known to defend its home from the Ultra Beasts. As seen in ''Revealing the Stuff of Legend!'', Tapu Lele and the other tapu can transform a Z-Ring into a Z-Power Ring.\n\nTapu Lele and the other guardian deities are the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Nature's Madness.

It has a mammalian head with mechanical parts. Covering most of its head and neck is a thick, silver mane that extends down over its chest. Its blunt snout is metallic on the bridge of its nose and upper jaw. Silvally has a triangular black nose framed by three red lines, pointed ears with bright pink and black insides, one visible fang on each side of its lower jaw, and a slight overbite. Its eyes are bright silver, have no visible pupils, and appear to be surrounded by an empty, black space. On each side of its head is a circular, metallic drive, with a white circle crossed by a metal line. On top of its head is a large, axe-like fur or feather crest. The tip of the crest has a hooked, metallic piece, while the back has three white feathers. Silvally's lower body is mostly covered in short, black fur. The lower half of each front leg is insectoid and green with spikes along the back, while the rear legs have thick purple scales on the flanks, shins, and the top of the foot. All four of its feet have three toes, but in the front two toes face forward and one backward. Additionally, the hind paws have a short, gray claw on the back of the ankle. Its fishlike tail consists of two dark blue spines with a white fin stretched between them. The top spine has a line of short, gray spikes.\nOnce Type: Null finds a trusted partner and forms a powerful bond with them, it gains the strength and willpower needed to destroy its control mask and finally evolve into its original form, Silvally. After its Evolution, it reactivates its RKS System, gaining the ability to change its type through the Memories created by the Aether Foundation; this ability was based on the powers of a certain Pokemon depicted in myths. Additionally, Silvally's speed and senses are increased due to Evolution. It was created as part of the beast killer project as an \"Anti-UB Fighting life-form\", however, the project was deemed a failure and a control helmet was built to seal away its power, turning it into Type: Null. It reverts back to its natural, wild temperament, but it is still extremely loyal to its Trainer, and it will even risk its own life in its partner's defense. Gladion was the one who coined Silvally\u2019s name, but when it was created, it was named as \"Type: Full\" due to its ability to change between all types. Being created to hunt down Ultra Beasts, as seen in SM and Pokemon Adventures, Silvally can feel the appearance of Ultra Beasts and the opening of Ultra Wormholes. \n\nSilvally is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Multi-Attack.

It has round purple-striped plates on its shoulder area, where two pink pearl-like crystals lie encrusted with a gray rim encircling them, and fin-like wings on its back. Palkia's arms have extended formations resembling gauntlets and a purple band around each wrist. Palkia has a long neck that is normally bent, a pointed white crest on the top of its head that extends to its wings, two strong horn-like tusks on the sides of its jaw, and a powerful tail. It has faint cracks along its legs and tail.\n\nAccording to the myths and legends of the Hisui/Sinnoh region, in the beginning of existence, the Mythical Pokemon Arceus created eggs in which the Pokemon of space\u2013Palkia, the Pokemon of time\u2013Dialga, and the Pokemon of antimatter\u2013Giratina, hatched from, all three in their Origin Formes. After the Pokemon universe was created, Palkia retreated into its own dimension, where it has lived ever since. It was revered and feared as a deity in the past, being worshipped by the Pearl Clan, who mistook it for Arceus and referred to it as \"almighty Sinnoh\". Palkia is capable of speaking human language via telepathy, as seen when it communicates through the leader of the Pearl Clan, Irida. Palkia and Dialga may be also thrown into a frenzy by powerful space-time rifts created by Giratina. Both can also control and spread the space-time distortions from Giratina's rift, which create alpha Pokemon and cause noble Pokemon to become frenzied through lightning bolts that come out of these distortions.\n\nPalkia has power over space: it can warp space and travel to faraway places as well as alternate dimensions and parallel timelines. Additionally, it is capable of rending its targets along with the space around it. It even has the power to destroy and create an entire universe, either by itself or with Dialga's aid. As seen in JN, Palkia can open and close dimensional portals to alternate universes. It is said that the birth of Palkia was what caused the walls of the world to disappear, creating a sky that spans for infinity. It is also stated that space becomes more stable with its every breath. Palkia usually travels by levitating. Since Palkia primarily resides in a different dimension, its behavior is nearly impossible to study. The dimension Palkia lives in is said to be in shreds like ribbons. In the anime,  it has been shown to be very protective of its home, and as a result, tends to have violent conflicts with Dialga when their dimensions intersect. Palkia is capable of travelling by creating a large yellow sphere from its two pearls, then using it to fly very fast, as seen in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. \n\nPalkia is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Spacial Rend.",

The rock is trapezoidal in shape and has two small dots. There is a fissure running down the middle, splitting in two near the bottom. The crack in combination with the two dots appears to form a frowning face. Spiritomb's projected appearance is an ethereal composition of swirling purple energy of an unknown kind. Its face is set in the middle of the purple, and contains green, crescent eyes that are connected to its jagged mouth. Its pupils are composed of a spiral and it is sometimes only seen with one. Swirling around its face are green orbs with yellow centers.\n\nSpiritomb is formed by a collection of 108 spirits, some of which are ill-natured. This collection of spirits is known for its misdeeds; thus, as punishment, the spirits were trapped to its Odd Keystone by a traveler using a mysterious spell. Several Pokedex entries state that Spiritomb was sealed roughly 500 years before the present time. The Pokemon lays curses with its wicked thoughts. It will lash out at anyone with little thought, often exercising short-sightedness in its pursuit of vengeance. It is rarely encountered in the wild. In most media, Spiritomb moves its body primarily through levitation; though in the core series games, it can only appear to do so through dragging the Odd Keystone across the ground.\n\nPapers found within Sea Mauville in Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire state that it was donated from the Oreburgh Mine, suggesting that several Odd Keystones meant to contain Spiritomb can be found in the Underground of Sinnoh. Professor Cozmo's father, Raizoh, was responsible for misplacing it when working on the ship.''\"The file folder holds a stack of ragged papers.<br> Official Statem\u2014 of Apolog\u2014 <br> I, \u2014izo\u2014 Co\u2014mo, am respon\u2014 for the los\u2014 of the Odd Keystone dona\u2014d...by the Oreb\u2014gh Mine...\"''\n\nIn Pokemon Legends: Arceus, Spiritomb's 108 spirits appear in the form of Wisps, small purple entities scattered across the Hisui region after a seal was broken. When 107 Wisps have been taken to a large Odd Keystone shrine at the Crimson Mirelands' Shrouded Ruins as per Vessa's request, she will provide the player with the final Wisp and disappear, with a wild Spiritomb appearing shortly afterwards.\n\nAs depicted in ''The Keystone Pops!'', Spiritomb can be just as aggressive and destructive as the spirits that it is composed of. ''The Spectral Express!'' also revealed that anyone possessed by one of Spiritomb's spirits will start to cause misdeeds, and their face will eventually start to resemble Spiritomb. Losing one of these spirits will cause Spiritomb to go on an uncontrollable rampage until the lost spirit is returned.",

Its eyes are beady black through the holes in the body of its disguise however, as seen in the animated series, its eyes are actually purple. Fringe of an amorphous foot or lower body is visible under the hem as well. Occasionally, it will also extend a long, black claw-like appendage from under its rag. When angered, its eyes will glow yellow. The veil itself resembles a Pikachu. The cloth is yellow with black-tipped ears. The Pikachu face appears to be drawn with crayons, consisting of black eyes, red cheeks, and a squiggly black mouth. The rag's head is hollow and can be used to store objects. Mimikyu also carries a small stick resembling a lightning bolt to create a tail for its costume. When its disguise is damaged, the costume's head droops limply backward, revealing Mimikyu's ruse. Larger rips in the costume are accompanied by shadowy vapors pouring out from whatever is hidden within.\n\nA lonely Pokemon, Mimikyu is always covered by its disguise. It is unknown what Mimikyu's true appearance looks like. However, glimpses of it are seen, such as its claw, its underside, and its eyes. Since this Pokemon is weakened by sunlight, it is rumored that the veil is used for protection. It is believed that seeing its true form will cause a mysterious illness or even a painful death. Because of this, Mimikyu will become agitated and violently stop anyone from attempting to look underneath its rag. \n\nMimikyu's disguise is modeled after Pikachu because of the popularity of Pikachu-styled merchandise, thinking that its disguise would allow it to make friends with people. It uses the disguise to bond more with humans and other Pokemon. Unfortunately, this attempt makes its disguise look more creepy. Until recent times, Mimikyu was initially thought by humans to be just a ghost wearing a cloth. As mentioned in Pokemon Sleep, Mimikyu mimics Pikachu to the point it even sleeps similar to it. Its relationship to Pikachu can vary between individuals and canons, with some being antagonistic, as seen in SM, or can be friendly, as shown in the short, ''A Mimikyu Bedtime Story''.\n\nA special Mimikyu in Alola acts as the Totem Pokemon for Acerola's trial in an abandoned Thrifty Megamart. This Mimikyu possesses Z-Power, an energy that originates from Ultra Wormholes and takes the form of a golden, flaring aura. The reward for defeating Totem Mimikyu and completing the trial is a Ghostium Z.\n\nMimikyu is the only known Pokemon capable of using the Z-Move Let's Snuggle Forever.

Both forms have amorphous, slug-like bodies, black oval-shaped eyes with yellow outlines, minuscule, dot-shaped noses, and wide yellow lips. Like real-world sea slugs, they have mantles covering the top halves of their bodies. These mantles are outlined in yellow, similar to their eyes. Unlike real sea slugs, however, they have bulbous heads and four small feet rather than one large foot.\n\nThe West Sea form's underside is white, and its mantle is pink, with several small spike-like protrusions on its back. On its head is a ring of pink, fleshy knobs resembling the gills of a nudibranch. West Sea Shellos' appearance is theorized to have been influenced by warm ocean waters.\n\nThe East Sea form, meanwhile, sports a green underside and a turquoise mantle. Two yellow-lined, flap-like protrusions, resembling cerata, are present along its back. On its head are two white-tipped tentacles resembling rhinophores that extend away from its face. East Sea Shellos's appearance is theorized to have been influenced by cold ocean waters.\n\nShellos lives along seashores; its color becomes more vibrant the better quality of the waters it lives in. It is also believed that Shellos's diet, which consists of plankton, also influences its form, though this has yet to be proven. The physical differences between both forms appear largely cosmetic; no significant changes in capabilities have been observed. While it can travel onto land, it can only stay on the shore for a limited time before its skin dries out. When Shellos' squishy body is pressed or squeezed, or when Shellos senses imminent danger, a mysterious purple fluid \u2014 theorized to be a kind of stress-induced greasy sweat \u2014 will ooze out of its body. This fluid is its defense mechanism against enemies; although harmless, it is very sticky and hard to wash off. Shellos has a friendly disposition and is said to have great regenerative capabilities. In the animated series, West Sea Shellos can extend their necks to incredible lengths. It is unknown if the East Sea form can do this as well.\n\nThis species once had a shell on its back long ago and is considered a close relative to Pokemon such as Shellder. The Nurse Joy featured in ''Gateway to Ruin!'' revealed Mount Coronet's formation led to an allopatric speciation event, in which the original population of Shellos was separated into two. As a result, Shellos's color and other physical aspects began to vary due to environmental differences and population isolation over time. The two forms are still able to interbreed; the child normally takes the mother's form but takes the father's if bred with a Ditto. Recently, East Sea Shellos' population has been declining, while West Sea Shellos has become more abundant than before.",

Three pointed teeth jut out the bottom of either side of its jaws, which are frozen shut by the ice covering its head. Its long, gray neck has lines running around its whole body, legs, arms, and tail. It has two arms, each with two claws, and each arm is joined by its oddly-shaped, blue ice wings. Each wing has two spikes which are bioluminescent. If its wings are broken, gray tendril-like appendages are revealed on Kyurem's back. The right side of its body seems to be damaged in some way, as the wing and horn on its head on that side are shorter; the right side of its head also has a spiked edge near its jaw hinge that is absent from its left. Its legs are somewhat slender and have three sharp ice-like claws on each enormous foot. Its tail has three blue conical spikes on its tip, and appears to be some sort of propulsion device or a container of energy; exactly what it is based on is unclear, but it may be a damaged turbine.\n\nKyurem generates powerful, freezing energy inside itself, but its body becomes frozen when the energy leaks out. It appears that this Pokemon uses its ice powers to freeze its own body in order to stabilize its cellular structure. It is said to have a power that exceeds that of Reshiram and Zekrom, however, this power is kept at bay by the extreme cold. Kyurem can use its tendril-like appendages to transform Reshiram and Zekrom back into their respective Dragon Stones and even absofuse with them while they're in that state. In Pokemon Adventures, similarly to Reshiram and Zekrom, Kyurem is somehow capable of flying even with its frozen wings. According to the Village of Dragons's Elder in ''Kyurem VS. The Sword of Justice'', Kyurem is considered one of the strongest Dragon Pokemon in the world. Kyurem is powerful enough to cover Opelucid City and even the entire Unova region in ice. Kyurem loves Kyurem Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered it in the past.\n\nAccording to an old legend in Lacunosa Town, Kyurem is an extraterrestrial Pokemon that crashlanded on the planet inside either an icy meteor or a Dragon Stone, creating the Giant Chasm. This same legend describes Kyurem as hostile towards Pokemon and humans, due to the fact it supposedly devoured them if they were found outside of Lacunosa Town during the night. However, according to another old legend told by Drayden, Kyurem was created by the leftovers of the single powerful Dragon Pokemon owned by the twin heroes of Unova after it split up into Reshiram and Zekrom.

It also has a red spiky growth around its neck. It has skinny arms and long black tatters hanging from its shoulders. It also has black, claw-like hands. It has the slight appearance of an hourglass figure and appears to be wearing an old, ripped cloak. It normally does not have any sort of legs, but it is able to extend stilt-like appendages in their place. In self-defense, Darkrai can retract its head and white \"plume\" into the pit atop its torso fringed by the aforementioned red growth.\n\nDarkrai is known to \"inhabit\" dreams and causes the target to have unending nightmares, which can be stopped if exposed to a Lunar Feather from Cresselia. However, the \"unleashing of nightmares\" is actually a defense mechanism, instead of an intentionally malicious act. Darkrai is capable of flying at high speeds, and it can become a shadow in order to escape danger or contact with humans. It is also capable of some human speech, and can manifest dark energy for offensive purposes. However, in ''The Rise of Darkrai'', it was shown that its power was weaker than that of Dialga and Palkia. Its relationship to its counterpart, Cresselia, can vary between individuals and canons, with some being antagonistic, as seen ''Sleepless In Pre-Battle!'' and Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Time, Darkness, and Sky, or cooperative, as seen in ''Nightfall?

It can also go around objects it is attracted to several times, as seen in the mentioned episode and Pokemon Ranger: Shadows of Almia. Shadows of Almia also reveal Darkrai can use an ability called ''Dark Power'' to either trap humans or Pokemon in a ''Dark Void'' dimension of total darkness or teleport them to another location. \n\nDarkrai is said to be active on nights of the new moon.

One eye has a small, brown dot in the corner. Even while apparently at rest, Minior tends to spin slowly in place.\n\nWhen its core is exposed, Minior loses its rocky shell. The core is a bright, pastel color. Depending on the color of debris and food it absorbed and ate while in the stratosphere, Minior's core can be Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, or Violet. A handful of darker triangles are also visible on its body in random places. Minior's eyes and mouth are formed from energy that floats in front of its body like a two-dimensional mask. The eyes are two large swirls and the mouth is a smaller line. Its face tends to stay level regardless of how Minior spins the rest of its body. The colors of Minior's forms are determined by the composition of the dust it consumes.\n\nMinior forms in the stratosphere from an aggregation of mutated nanoparticles, where it absorbs particulate matter from which it builds its core and shell. When touched in Meteor Form, Minior will react when touched or called to, it is unknown if these responses indicate its consciousness. Eventually, this process makes it too heavy and it falls towards the surface of the planet. When its shell breaks from landing, Minior becomes lighter and capable of attacking quickly. However, it cannot survive for long with its core exposed, and will eventually die if not placed inside a Poke Ball quickly enough. Despite this, many fallen Minior will attempt to return to space, sadly being unable to return to space. Despite their wish to return home, all they can do is fade away without their shells. The cute, pastel coloring of Minior's core often inspires designers to use it as a motif for clothing and accessories. While in the ozone layer, it serves as food to stronger Pokemon such as Rayquaza. Minior's diet consists of eating dust. Places where Minior falls are few, Alola being one of them.\n\nMinior is the only known Pokemon that can have Shields Down as an Ability.",

    "category": "Magnet",
    "bio": "Magneton is a robot-like Pokemon, the result of three Magnemite becoming linked together by a strong magnetic force, although a single Magnemite can evolve by itself when there are no other Magnemite in the vicinity. Each individual Magnemite has a gray spherical body with a single eye, and a gray and red-and-blue tipped horseshoe magnet on each side. The topmost Magnemite has three Phillips head screws on its body, while the others appear to have only two. The three Magnemite that Magneton consists of can be linked in several ways. Magneton is most commonly seen as one Magnemite on top, and two Magnemite linked by the screws on the bottom, forming a triangle. In some cases, commonly seen in 3D games such as Snap, the Magnemite will not be connected at all, remain in a triangular formation at rest, and are able to freely move within each other's vicinity to form other patterns. In this case, all three Magnemite have three screws. The magnetic forces that hold the three Magnemite together are powerful enough to dry up all moisture and raise the temperature by 3.6&nbsp;\u00b0F (2&nbsp;\u00b0C) within a radius of 3,300 feet (one kilometer). It can also be disruptive to electronic devices and induce earaches. It uses powerful radio waves to help it study the surrounding area.\n\nMagneton's anti-gravitational powers enable it to fly through the air. Being composed of three Magnemite, it is about three times as powerful electrically, though not three times as intelligent. Even though Magneton is a mechanical creature, it still needs to eat. As seen in the ''Pokemon the Series'' episode ''The Poke Spokesman'', food for Magneton consists of electrical currents. It is usually found in rough terrain, often near power plants. \n\nWhen sunspots flare up, Magneton tends to appear more often, presumably due to the changes in the sun's magnetic field. When rain clouds form, it also gathers in high areas prone to lightning strikes. As seen in the eleventh chapter of Pokemon Adventures, it possesses the ability to form its electricity into both platforms and barriers. As seen in the HZ episode ''The Future I Choose'', it can cause interference with phone and internet signals. In ''An Unexpected Picnic!'', a herd of Magneton produced an EMP that could destroy computer software. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, carvings depicting Magneton have been discovered at the Ruins of Alph. One was shown in the Pokemon Generations episode ''The Redemption'' in a flashback to the great war of Kalos, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years. Additionally, Sandy Shocks bears a strong resemblance to Magneton. It is believed to be an ancient Magneton that was alive 10,000 years ago. As mentioned in Pokemon Sleep, Magneton is known to sleep with its three linked Magnemite either stuck together or drifting apart by a strong magnetic force. It is theoried that its magnetism is unstable while Magneton sleeps.",

    "bio": "Dialga is a dark-blue, sauropod-like Pokemon with some gray metallic portions and light blue stripes. It has a chest plate on its torso, which has a deep blue diamond-like crystal embedded in the center. Dialga has a five-spiked fin-like structure on its back similar to a gear, three spines on the back of its neck, and a crest on its head, resembling a dinosaur. The crest somewhat resembles the shape of a sundial's rod. It also has two structures on the sides of its head that extend outward and resemble horns and fangs. It has three claws on each foot, of the same metallic look as its chest plate. \n\nAccording to the myths and legends of the Hisui/Sinnoh region, in the beginning of existence, the Mythical Pokemon Arceus created eggs in which the Pokemon of time\u2013Dialga, the Pokemon of space\u2013Palkia, and the Pokemon of antimatter\u2013Giratina, hatched from, all three in their Origin Formes. After the Pokemon universe was created, Dialga retreated into its own dimension, where it has lived since. It was revered and feared as a deity in the past, being worshipped by the Diamond Clan, who mistook it for Arceus and referred to it as \"almighty Sinnoh\". Dialga is capable of speaking human language via telepathy, as seen when it communicates through the leader of the Diamond Clan, Adaman. Dialga and Palkia may be also thrown into a frenzy by powerful space-time rifts created by Giratina. Both can also control and spread the space-time distortions from Giratina's rift, which create alpha Pokemon and cause noble Pokemon to become frenzied through lightning bolts that come out of these distortions. \n\nDialga has the power to control time: it can warp time by either speeding it up, slowing it down, reversing it, or stopping it altogether. It can also travel through time to visit the past, present, and future. Additionally, it is capable of blasting its targets with power that distorts time itself. It also has the power to destroy and create an entire universe, either by itself or with Palkia's aid. As shown in JN, Dialga's temporal powers possess the ability to devolve anything or anyone against their will, including Pokemon, people, and plant life. It can reverse these effects as well. It is said that time started moving when Dialga was born and will continue flowing as long as its heart beats. Dialga usually travels by levitating. Since Dialga primarily resides in a different dimension, its behavior is nearly impossible to study. In the dimension where Dialga lives in, time is said to be constantly moving in different directions and speeds. In the anime, it has been shown to be very protective of its home, and as a result, tends to have violent conflicts with Palkia when their dimensions intersect. The fin-like structure on its back is shaped radiating outwards and can be used to focus the flow of time, as seen in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. \n\nDialga is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Roar of Time.",

Its eyes have blue irises and black pupils. There are two pairs of pointed teeth visible when its mouth is open, one in the upper jaw and one in the lower. Reshiram has a long and slender neck, with a fluffy, collar-like protrusion jutting out of two gray, glass-like neckbands. Its arms begin slender and arm-like but then flare into a more wing-like appearance, sporting four claws resembling hands on the leading edge. There are plates at the back of Reshiram's \"hands\" that sport a similar color to its neck rings. Reshiram has a feathered or furry feature on its chest, with the lower portion protruding outwards to a point. Long feather-like protrusions jut out of its thighs. On its feet are large gray claws, three at the front and one positioned at the back, resembling high heels. Reshiram's tail is a mass of plume and ribbon-like extensions, surrounded by two large bands, similar to the ones around its neck. When its emotions surge, it enters Overdrive mode, and its tail lights up with a fiery glow.\nReshiram has a jet engine-like tail, which it uses to accelerate itself when flying at high speeds. It can send flames from its tail into the air to incinerate everything around it. By flaring its tail, Reshiram can move the world's atmosphere and change the weather. This tail generator is also activated when influenced by either Zekrom's signature moves, which in turn powers up Reshiram's. Reshiram loves Reshiram Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered it in the past.\n\nIn Unovan mythology, Reshiram was created from a single Dragon Pokemon owned by the twin heroes when it split into two: Reshiram and Zekrom. It sided with the older brother who sought the truth; as a result, it firmly believes in truth. Reshiram is said to be Zekrom's equal in battle, meaning neither of the two dragons can truly defeat the other. It is powerful enough to destroy the Unova region with its intense, enveloping flames. Reshiram will transform into the Light Stone should its body get destroyed or when attacked by Kyurem's tendril-like appendages.

It is often referred to as amorphous, but has a relatively consistent appearance in official artwork, including two small nubs on its \"head\", a few soft lumps at its base, and two pseudopod-like protrusions in place of arms. The face consists of beady eyes and a simple mouth; almost always pulled into a smile.\n\nDitto bears a variety of unusual and often entirely unique traits that set it apart from every other Pokemon. It is capable of transforming into an exact replica of any physical object or living creature, including its form and properties. Each Ditto has its own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to transforming; being unable to remain transformed while laughing and getting details of its transformation wrong if based on memory being apparently universal. The Bandai Pokemon Carddass Cards depict Ditto being able to transform separate sections of its body into parts from multiple Pokemon at once. Similarly, in Pokemon Pokopia, Ditto can transform parts of its body even while transformed as a human, such as transforming its arms into Bulbasaur's vines to use Leafage. In the ''Pokemon the Series'' episodes ''Ditto's Mysterious Mansion'' and ''Deceiving Appearances!'', as well as in the TCG and some spin-off games, it is shown that occasionally Ditto cannot change its face during transformation; this trait has become synonymous with the species, despite being incongruous with their depiction in the core series games. While its transformation ability allows it to get along with almost anything, it does not get along with its own kind, which it will quickly (and generally fruitlessly) attempt to transform into. \n\nWhile Ditto can transform into a human, it cannot mimic human speech. It transforms into a rock when sleeping to avoid being attacked. As mentioned in Sleep, Ditto is known to sleep while still transformed into either a rock or Pokemon. On very rare occasions, a sleeping Ditto will transform back to normal when it is relaxed. In The Indigo Disk, various Ditto Blocks can be found as objectives in Blueberry Quests throughout the Terarium, where Ditto will seemingly transform into one of the many cubes with rounded edges that make up many of the structures of the Terarium. Despite being milestones for the player to obtain, and not actually obtainable themselves, they can still be Shiny.\n\nDitto is never far from civilization or people, and is the only Pokemon capable of using the Metal Powder and Quick Powder items.

Regardless of mode, its main body is always black with a blue stripe down its back and a short, bushy tail. Starting at its knees there is a blade-like trim around each leg, which forms a point under each hoof. There is an upside-down, V-shaped marking on its chest in the same color as the trim on its legs. Its head and neck are blue, and there are two large, tufts that extend onto its chest and curve upward. Its first pair of antlers extends onto its head and curves around the underside of its eyes. The eyes are black with X-shaped pupils. There is a short marking on top of its snout and an upward curving horn on each side of its head in place of ears.\n\nIn Active Mode, its markings, antlers, and trim on its legs are pale gold. Its antlers have branches and bumps in many colors and there are multicolored spots on its back. Xerneas assumes this Mode during battle or when using its power. Xerneas is at full power when in Active Mode.\n\nIn Neutral Mode, its markings and antlers are instead pale blue and the embellishments on its antlers and spots on its back are a darker blue. Xerneas assumes Neutral Mode when not battling and traveling. This remains until it needs to use Active Mode.\n\nXerneas has the power to share eternal life. This occurs when the horns on its head shine in seven colors. Xerneas can use its life energy to create vast forests and restore life to them. It can infuse both humans and Pokemon with energy and vitality. Because of this, Xerneas is highly respected by the ancient people of Kalos for its role in giving life. Xerneas is also known to be able to speak through telepathy. According to legend, Xerneas is known to have rescued wounded Pokemon during an ancient war. Xerneas and Yveltal have the power to transform Evolution stones into Mega Stones as seen with the ultimate weapon's blast shot by AZ 3000 years ago. Both are in charge of taking care of the land in a delicate balance between life and death. Xerneas's power can also be used to power up machines such as the ultimate weapon. It can also absorb the energy around itself, sharply strengthening itself as a result through rainbow-colored lights.\n\nAs seen in ''Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction'', if it exhausts too much life energy, it transforms into a tree and sleeps for 1,000 years. Xerneas has the power to revive those who have been petrified by Yveltal. However, as seen in ''The Legend of X, Y, and Z!'', it couldn't undo Aila's case for unknown reasons. It was also shown capable of calming Yveltal should it get enraged. In ''Sylveon Enchants'', Xerneas was shown making plants grow by simply touching them.

Its body is composed of highly durable metal and is primarily cool gray. It possesses dark blue accents on its palms and soles, as well as dark blue platings on its face and underside. The underside plating has criss-crossing patterns on the torso, and two red stripes at the bottom, with three small notches on each of them. This plating extends past Archaludon's head at the sides, forming horn-like features tipped with red. There is a continuous protrusion running the length of Archaludon's spine, three pairs of zigzag patterns on its sides, and spikes on the back of its head and the tip of its large tail.\n\nArchaludon's head is small compared to its body and is sunken into its neck. The plating on its face is T-shaped with a few indents on the sides, and folds down the middle to partially cover its yellow eyes. Its mouth, shaped into a permanent scowl, opens at the upper jaw and contains a grooved copper-colored tube, which it uses to fire beams to attack. When it closes its mouth, the tube is concealed and resembles teeth.\n\nArchaludon's hands and feet are large and V-shaped, each of which are connected to cuboid forelimbs and have two rectangular digits. On these hands and feet, Archaludon has tall, retractable spires near the joints, with the spires on its feet usually retracted. These spires contain pointed, yellow terminals at their tips, which gather and store static electricity from Archaludon's surroundings, as it is incapable of producing electricity on its own. Similar terminal pairs are found on the spikes on Archaludon's head and tail.\n\nWhen Archaludon faces danger, it will get down on all fours, straighten its body, retract its limbs, and fully extend the spires on its hands and feet, forming a shape that resembles a steel bridge. This position allows for less mobility but offers Archaludon a sturdier center of gravity. In this position, Archaludon is capable of using the static electricity stored in its terminals to fire a tremendously powerful beam of electric energy. When Archaludon charges up to fire this beam, electrical energy connects the terminals on its head, tail, and limbs, in a similar fashion to bridge suspension cables. During storms and other inclement weather, Archaludon's terminals can gather static electricity more easily, allowing it to fire off its beam much faster. Archaludon's defensive capabilities are so strong that it cannot be fazed by a cave-in. Archaludon resides in boreal mountains, and often digs holes in its habitat while searching for food.\n\nArchaludon and its pre-evolved form, Duraludon, are the only known Pokemon that can have Stalwart as an Ability.

The hair reaches midway down its body and is rimmed with bright blue. The \"hat\" has two small blue dots and four white spikes arranged in an X-shape. These spikes resemble decorative hair sticks. On the very top of its hat is a long gray horn similar to a drill bit. It has large, disembodied gray arms that resemble bamboo stalks. At the end of each arm is a ring of bright blue, fin-like projections and a collection of eight smaller, black bamboo shoots. Each smaller stalk has a bright blue ring with a small line extending back up the stalk. Its main body is conical and resembles a dress with four overlapping layers. The shortest and outermost layer is the shortest and appears metallic, while the inner layers are each a lighter shade of green, progressively longer, and seem to be cloth or plant material. Underneath all the layers is a white body with a light gray crisscross pattern covering it and a bright blue ring along the base. Below the dress is what appears to be a collection of eight black bamboo stalks. On the bottom of each stalk is a bright blue ring with a small line extending back up the stalk; this causes the stalks to also resemble solid rocket boosters. Celesteela is one of the heaviest Pokemon, tying with Cosmoem.\n\nCelesteela live in another world named Ultra Crater. It appears to grow out of the ground like a plant in its homeworld, before exploding the ground around itself and flying away into space for unknown reasons. According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation, Celesteela's most distinctive feature is the energy that it stores within itself, a flammable gas that it can shoot from its two huge arms and bottom.\nThis is mostly used to propel itself in flight and for battle, but it has sufficient power and lift to even fly into space. Its bodily construction closely resembles that of a plant, specially bamboo, even being capable of absorbing nutrients from the soil.\n\nWicke also claims that like all Ultra Beasts, Celesteela stores Z-Power, the same energy possessed by Totem Pokemon, within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura. Celesteela's rocket thrusters are powerful enough to destroy an entire bamboo forest. As seen in ''Rise and Shine, Starship!'', Celesteela have a long lifespans, as one was buried in Alola, growing for over 200 years. According to the legend \"The Celestial Starship\", told in that same episode, a mysterious object fell from the sky and was discovered by an old couple to be a large bamboo shoot, which greatly resembled an infant version of Celesteela, being later named Celeste by the couple. The couple cared for it, but due to it absorbing the nutrients of the plants around itself, the other villagers tried attacking it, but Celeste transformed and flew away into space.

    "bio": "Pecharunt is a small Pokemon resembling a piece of mochi. It has two forms it can take both inside and outside of battle. The first form resembles an upside-down peach, with a black circular face at the center and a thin, vertical line splitting its body into two halves. In its face are two white semicircle eyes, appearing to be frowning. It takes its second form upon opening up, revealing a smaller inner body resembling a peach's pit. It has a darker purple and pink body with two white eyes which are usually frowning, below which is a white, ribbon-shaped mouth. On its head rests two purple flaps and a scorpion-like ponytail. It has two heart-shaped paws at the bottom of its body, along with three black dots on each side underneath them. The discarded shell floats on both sides of Pecharunt, forming spiky wing-like appendages. The inside of these shells have a bright pink glow, outlined in black. The bright pink extends slightly through the black outline in six thin lines. The chains have a magenta color to them and are divided in identical segments, ending in a slightly larger segment with two protrusions, making it resemble the shape of Pecharunt's shell.\n\nPecharunt stores poison in its peach-shaped shell and uses it to create toxic chains and roll up poisonous Binding Mochi, which are stored in its shell until they are needed. It is able to use its toxic chains in combat, badly poisoning its enemies in the process. The chains are also capable of empowering other Pokemon, using its toxins to enhance certain aspects of their bodies, such as their muscles, brain, or looks, as seen with Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti, respectively. It serves its mochi to Pokemon and humans, but may also shoot them at their mouths if necessary. The mochi draw out their deepest desires and powers, but the ones who eat it become chained to Pecharunt's will, as seen with its caretakers, who had their greed drawn out. In some cases, the ones that eat it may completely fall under its control, as seen with Mossui Town's residents and the player's friends from Paldea.\n\nAccording to the player, Pecharunt smells incredibly sweet. It is known to feign weakness by weeping, and acting like a baby in order to gain sympathy from others. Pecharunt can retreat into its shell and remain dormant for years. After being knocked out in Kitakami, it started being known as the \"Never-Rotting Peach\" due to its peach-like shell.\n\nHumans under Pecharunt's control have purple eyes and are surrounded by a purple aura. It can even command humans and Pokemon to fight for it in battles, capable of controlling many beings at once. It relies on others to fight for it due to its cowardly personality and size. However, Pecharunt will fight back if it is has no other option. Capturing Pecharunt will free those under its control with no memories of being controlled. \n\nPecharunt is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Malignant Chain. It is also the only known Pokemon that can have Poison Puppeteer as an Ability.\n",

    "bio": "Guzzlord is a massive, black Ultra Beast. Its main body is primarily spherical with a large, yellow mouth in the center. The top and bottom of the mouth are lined with two rows of teeth; the front row is yellow, while the rear row is black. In the second row of the upper jaw, two teeth curve out of the mouth similar to tusks. The inside of its mouth is a bright blue and its throat is lined with small spikes; its large black tongue is also lined with small spikes. Additional tongues resembling long arms with pincers protrude from its lower jaw even when its mouth is closed. Just above its mouth are two glowing, blue eyes with a yellow, diamond-shaped marking between them. Above each eye is a single, bat-like wing with yellow along the upper edge. There are other small bat-like wings down the sides of its body as well. On the underside of its body are three, fin-like projections that curve up towards its mouth. Guzzlord's body is supported by a pair of thick legs, which have yellow zigzag markings across the knees and three claws each. On top of its body is a small, conical head with a second, smaller pair of glowing blue eyes. Four short horns with yellow tips form a ring around its head. On either side of its head is a larger, slightly curved horn also tipped in yellow. There is also a pair of arms on top of its body. Each arm has a hand with three yellow claws. A row of small spikes trails down its back and along its tail. The tail itself extends from the center of its back and resembles a medieval mace.\n\nGuzzlord live in another world known as the Ultra Ruin, which is an alternate universe's Alola, more specifically Hau'oli City. In the SM episode ''Battling the Beast Within!'', it was revealed that Guzzlord is not native to the Ultra Ruin; it actually got there through an Ultra Wormhole and started devouring everything, leaving a barren wasteland behind. In the same episode, it was revealed that the second face above its maw is Guzzlord's weak point. Its body is said to feel like hard rubber. In order to eat, its tongue moves in a wave-like motion that pulls food towards its mouth. Guzzlord has an astounding appetite, devouring not only objects, but the ground, rivers, and even the seas. There have been reports of it eating mountains and buildings whole. Despite the massive amounts that it consumes, no droppings have been found, which may suggest its digestion is perfect, converting everything into energy in order to sustain itself. According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation, Guzzlord's most distinctive feature is its limitless appetite. It feeds without pause every moment that it is awake. It uses the two large tongues that protrude from its mouth to catch and devour everything in its path, be it organic or inorganic matter. And while it eats such an inordinate amount, Guzzlord excreta has never been discovered. It is thought that it might fully convert the things that it eats into energy for it to use.\n\nWicke also claims that like all Ultra Beasts, Guzzlord stores Z-Power, the same energy possessed by Totem Pokemon, within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura.",

    "category": "Synthetic",
    "bio": "Type: Null is a quadrupedal, chimeric Pokemon with traits from a variety of creatures. Its head is enclosed in a brown helmet with green markings, designed to suppress its power to stable levels. The helmet is extremely heavy and hinders its agility. The helmet has a large jaw piece that wraps around the front with large, round hinges on the side. Each hinge is covered by a green X-shaped marking. The name of the Pokemon, as it wears the helmet, is called Null meaning nothing. Small gray eyes can be seen from within rectangular black holes on the front, and there are two pointed ears on the top. Around the base is a collar with four protruding vanes that are tipped with a three-way spike. This collar has a thin green line between the vanes, and each vane has a green hexagon near the end. An axe-like blade with a band around the middle extends backward from the top of the helmet. The front tip of the blade has a small, silver spike that hooks downward.\n\nA mane of gray fur hangs from below Type: Null's helmet and covers its shoulders and chest. Most of its torso and legs is covered in short black fur. The lower half of each front leg is insectoid and green with spikes along the back, while the rear legs have thick purple scales on the flanks, shins, and on the top of the foot. All four of its feet have three toes, but in the front two toes face forward and one backward. Additionally, the hind paws have a short, gray claw on the back of the ankle. Its fishlike tail consists of two dark blue spines with a light blue fin stretched between them. The top spine has a line of short, gray spikes.\n\nType: Null was created by the Aether Foundation as part of the beast killer project. It was designed to be an \"Anti-UB Fighting life-form\", a weapon created to fight against the Ultra Beasts. Also known as \"'''beast killer'''\", Type: Null was developed with cells taken from all known Pokemon types. This was done with the intention of giving it the ability to shift between types by holding a corresponding memory, an ability originally inspired by the myths researched at Canalave Library. This ability led the Aether Foundation to name it \"Type: Full\". Three known models of Type: Full were created, but all three rejected the RKS System and went berserk. Faba had created limiter helmets for these Pokemon, and after being subdued, the three Type: Full were given the helmets to lessen the effects of the RKS System's rejection and were put into permanent cryogenic stasis. Thus, the beast killer project was deemed a failure, and the creature's name changed to Type: Null. At some point before the events of Generation VII, Gladion was able to free one of the Type: Null, which he adopted as his own in the hopes of finding a way to undo the effects of the limiter helmet and allow it to use the RKS System. Gladion would eventually rediscover its Evolution, Type: Full, renaming it as Silvally. When Type: Null evolves into Silvally, it breaks the helmet it wears in the process. Prior to the events of Pokemon Sword and Shield, a new Type: Null is created in the Galar region, apparently by Macro Cosmos by utilizing research notes stolen from Alola. Being created to hunt down Ultra Beasts, as seen in Pokemon the Series: Sun & Moon and Pokemon Adventures, Type: Null can feel the appearance of Ultra Beasts and the opening of Ultra Wormholes.",

    "bio": "Solgaleo is a large, white Pokemon resembling a lion. It has a blunt muzzle with a blue-gray nose and pale blue eyes. The top half of its face is a deep blue area that shows a constantly changing starscape. Four yellow spikes frame Solgaleo's head like a crown and two more pairs of spikes adorn either side of its lower jaw. Each spike separates large tufts of Solgaleo's mane. Solid ridges\u2014red nearest Solgaleo's head and yellow farther away\u2014poke out of each tuft along the middle, except on the tufts on its cheeks and chin, with the topmost part wrapping around the tip of the tuft. Overall, its mane creates the impression of a stylized sun. Around each leg is a dark orange band, and there is a black spot on each foot. It has three black toes on each foot with long yellow claws. At the tip of its tail is a large black spot with a thin yellow rim.\n\nWhen Solgaleo enters its Radiant Sun phase, its third eye\u2014a light blue symbol similar to a compass rose\u2014appears on its forehead, and the starscape turns to streaks of light. The fur on its body glows a pale yellow and all red and black parts of its body, including its belly and paws, turn bright yellow. It enters this phase while using its signature move or traveling through Ultra Space.\n\nSolgaleo has long been honored as an emissary of the sun; Solgaleo can create Ultra Wormholes to travel to and from Ultra Space. It can slam into its target with the force of a meteor. Alongside its counterpart Lunala, it can create Cosmog, which it is said to be the male Evolution of. Solgaleo and Lunala also have the power to create Z-Crystals and even restore Necrozma's light, allowing it to return to its true, Ultra form. It can also influence a Rockruff's Evolution into Lycanroc's Midday form with solar energy. Ultra Recon Squad uses Solgaleo as their own Ride Pokemon to travel through Ultra Space.\n\nSolgaleo, similar to Lunala, is a being composed of light; due to that, it is constantly hunted down by Necrozma through Ultra Space, so it can try and devour Solgaleo's light to ease its nonstop pain and regain its original form. This has resulted in an eternal conflict where Necrozma attempts to steal its limitless energy, with Solgaleo or its counterpart Lunala chasing after it to regain the stolen energy of light in an endless loop. When Necrozma takes control of Solgaleo, Necrozma's body divides into pieces that connect to Solgaleo's body like an armor, possessing it and transforming itself into Dusk Mane Necrozma, as its pieces constantly absorb Solgaleo's light. However, Solgaleo can coexist with Necrozma willingly, regardless of fusion. Solgaleo loves Solgaleo Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered it in the past.\n\nSolgaleo and Dusk Mane Necrozma are the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Sunsteel Strike. They are also the only known Pokemon capable of using the Z-Move Searing Sunraze Smash. Additionally, Solgaleo is the only known Pokemon that can have Full Metal Body as an Ability.\n",

    "bio": "Charizard is a draconic, bipedal Pokemon. It is primarily orange with a cream underside from the chest to the tip of its tail. It has a long neck, small blue eyes, slightly raised nostrils, and two horn-like structures protruding from the back of its rectangular head. Two fangs are visible in its upper jaw when its mouth is closed. Two large wings with blue-green undersides sprout from its back, and a horn-like appendage juts out from the top of the third joint of each wing. A single wing finger is visible through the center of each wing membrane. Charizard's arms are short and skinny compared to its robust belly, and each limb has three white claws. In Pokemon Red and Green, Charizard is seemingly shown holding a fireball, implying that it's capable of manipulating its flames using its hands; this is seen in media where it uses Fire Punch. It has stocky legs with cream-colored soles on each of its plantigrade feet. The tip of its long, tapering tail burns with a sizable flame, which can intensify to a blue flame if Charizard is irritated. \n\nCharizard typically inhabits mountains and valleys, such as the Charicific Valley in Johto. However, Charizard can also live in volcanoes, forming packs with other members of its family, including Charmander. In Pokemon Snap, it's shown that Charizard are fully capable of living inside lava within volcanic craters. \n\nCharizard flies in search of powerful opponents to battle, and its fire will burn hotter as it gains experience. Its fiery breath can melt boulders and massive glaciers and has been known to cause forest fires accidentally. Though its fiery breath is hot, it never turns it on any opponent weaker than itself. The GS episode ''Charizard's Burning Ambitions'' showed that only a weak Charizard would show off its power. The side story episode ''Those Darn Electabuzz!'' showed that Charizard can swim underwater, with Pokemon Origins further showing that the flame on the tip of the tail can still keep burning underwater. Charizard's wings can carry it to an altitude of 4,600 feet (1,400 meters), but An Illustrated Book of POCKET MONSTERS notes that its droppings were found on Mt. Fuji, implying it could fly thrice as high. In Pokemon Sleep, as well as media like the animated series, Charizard is known to sleep in an incredibly relaxed position,  as it is very confident in its power. It has three different sleep styles: ''Stomach Sleep'' (also used for ''Atop-Belly Sleep''), ''Tummy-Rub Sleep'', and ''Tummy-Up Sleep'' - the last of which has Charizard sleeping flat on its back, which may be an indicator of that Charizard being especially strong. In the animated series, it was shown that Charizard may be vulnerable to their tail flame going out in the same way as Charmander, according to the OS episode ''Charizard Chills'', where Ash warns his Charizard to not let its flame go out.\n\nEven though Charizard originally couldn't learn the move Fly, Trainers have been shown riding Charizard in official artwork dating back to the 1997 Carddass Trading Cards. Ash himself was shown riding his Charizard already in the second season of the original series of ''Pokemon the Series''. Eventually, in Yellow, Charizard became able to learn Fly and has since been frequently depicted as a Pokemon able to carry people on its back to fly them to distant areas. In Alola, Charizard is a Ride Pokemon called Charizard Glide, being used by the natives to fly around the region or make deliveries. \n",

On top of its head are two short, blunt, ear-like horns, and it has purple eyes. A tube extends from the back of its skull to the top of its spine, bypassing its neck. It has a defined chest and shoulders, which resemble a breastplate. The three digits on each hand and foot have spherical tips. Its tail is thick at the base but thins before ending in a small bulb.\n\nAccording to journals found in Kanto's Pokemon Mansion, after discovering the Mythical Pokemon Mew and gathering some of its DNA, Mr. Fuji used it in his mansion to create Mewtwo, a modified clone of Mew with the goal to making it the most powerful Pokemon of all. It was held and studied in the mansion, where it acquired extreme power and a vicious disposition after enduring horrific gene-splicing experiments. It eventually broke free and fled the Mansion, destroying it in the process. It is widely known as one of the most powerful Pokemon in existence and is said to have the most savage heart among all Pokemon, lacking compassion and striking fear into its enemy with cold, glowing eyes. Mewtwo conserves energy by remaining motionless in order to unleash its full power in battle. Because it was engineered to be the ultimate opponent in battle, it can only think of defeating its foes. Though rarely seen in the wild, it is said to be resting in dark caves somewhere.\n\nIn ''Mewtwo Strikes Back'', M01 was shown to be capable of levitation, mind control, memory erasure, telepathy, teleporting others to another location, and the creation of powerful storms. However, it was later shown to be caring, protective, and even altruistic. As shown in POK\u00c9MON Detective Pikachu, Mewtwo can also transfer a human's soul into a Pokemon's body provided that said Pokemon is in a crazed state, causing this person to gain control of the Pokemon's body and abilities. It possesses a rivalry with M01. As seen in ''Genesect and the Legend Awakened'', M16 can breathe in outer space.\n\nIn the Pokemon Adventures manga, Mewtwo's creation wasn't possible with the amount of Mew's cells gathered, so to complete it, human cells were used instead, specifically from the Team Rocket scientist Blaine. Due to Blaine possessing some of Mewtwo's cells as well, the two became linked, which granted Blaine to ability to track its whereabouts at the cost of slowly taking his life.\n\nMewtwo is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Psystrike.\n\n;Shadow Mewtwo\nA unique variant of Mewtwo, called Shadow Mewtwo, is very similar to standard Mewtwo, but with dark gray skin, a dark gray tail with a yellowish orange tip, and a shard of Shadow Synergy Stone coming out of its shoulder. In the past, Anne was almost possessed by a Shadow Synergy Stone but was saved by Mewtwo, whom the Shadow Synergy Stone took control of and merged with instead. Under the stone's influence, Shadow Mewtwo travelled around Ferrum, draining Gaia Power from other normal Synergy Stones, which continuously increases its power.\n\n|\n|}",

It has a ridged mouth similar to a beak, although it has pointed teeth on its lower jaw. Its head has a point to the back, and Lugia's eyes have pointed blue or black spikes on them. Lugia has a long, slender neck and a smooth, streamlined body. Dark blue or black plate-like protrusions run down the length of its back, and there are two smaller, more pointed ones on the end of its tail. It has large wings that resemble hands.\n\nLugia can fold back these plates to increase its speed. Though it is gender unknown, as depicted in ''The Mystery is History'', a young Lugia has been seen, suggesting there is a breeding population, at least in the animated series timeline. In the same episode, Lugia has been shown to be fiercely protective of its young, which also eat kelp. In the second Pokemon movie, Lugia leads the legendary birds and when they fight over territory, Lugia is the only Pokemon that can quell their ceaseless fighting, but cannot do so without a partner. Much like the birds, it possesses the ability to control the weather; most notably, it can calm and give rise to storms. \n\nIt is said that a light flutter of its wings is capable of causing winds powerful enough to tear a regular house down. If it were to flap its wings, it could hypothetically spawn storms lasting as long as forty days. Lugia is capable of splitting islands into smaller islands. When attacking, it is capable of shooting a vortex of air at its target and using psychic power. It is highly intelligent, and because of the devastating power it could accidentally inflict, it isolates itself deep underwater and tends to sleep in solitude. It is extremely rare and is hardly ever seen. In ancient times, the former Brass Tower in Ecruteak City was once Lugia's perch. However, after its destruction 150 years ago, Lugia moved to the Whirl Islands for the safety of others from its own power. It can be summoned at the Whirl Island through one of its feathers, Tidal Bells, and the dance of the Kimono Girls. Lugia had many different titles throughout the years as the \"'''guardian of the seas'''\", ''deity of the sea'', \"beast of the sea\", \"mythical sea creature\", and \"vengeance deity\".. There are rumors Lugia would appear during the night of a storm. Lugia loves Lugia Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered it in the past.\n\nLugia is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Aeroblast.\n\n;Shadow Lugia\n'''Shadow Lugia''' is the first and only XD-series Shadow Pokemon created by Lovrina of Cipher. It has jagged silver eye-spikes, a dark-purple body with white undersides, and glowing red eyes. It also has sharper toes that resemble claws, as well as a longer, more pointed tongue. Additionally, due to the shape of Lugia's back plates on its 3D models being changed after Generation IV, Shadow Lugia now possesses a unique design for them. \n\nShadow Lugia is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Shadow Blast.\n\n\n|\n\n|}",

    "bio": "Eternatus is a gigantic, draconic alien Pokemon. Its body has a vaguely draconic shape and skeletal appearance, and it is largely dark violet with red highlights. Its main body and tail are long and thin and resemble a spinal column, and it has four small, thin limbs ending in claws formed from spindly appendages attached at right angles. Its torso is formed from a cage of appendages resembling ribs, and inside is a glowing pink core that serves as Eternatus's energy source, absorbing energy to sustain it. Its head is triangular and has a pair of white, eye-like markings in the form of three connected circles, as well as a spindly lower jaw with several diamond-shaped teeth. Over its head is a translucent red film held between five long spikes extending toward its body's rear. It also has a pair of thin tendrils extending from its back, formed from numerous triangular segments. Eternatus's gigantic size makes it the tallest known Pokemon with the exception of Dynamax and Gigantamax Pokemon.\n\nEternatus serves as the source of the Dynamax phenomenon in Galar due to its power leaking out in the form of Galar particles following its defeat 3000 years ago by Zacian, Zamazenta, and two human youths. After it reawakened in the present day, Eternatus's core needed to reabsorb the Galar particles in order to remain active, apparently due to its past defeat weakening it. In Pokemon Masters EX, Eternatus can replace Galar particles by absorbing sync stone energy in massive amounts instead. Its core can also project its absorbed energy into massive blasts fired directly from its center. These blasts are capable of causing more damage to Dynamax and Gigantamax Pokemon. Pieces of its body imbued with its power rain down throughout Galar in the form of Wishing Pieces and Wishing Stars. When it is awake, Eternatus causes a phenomenon dubbed the Darkest Day, in which the massive quantities of Dynamax energy it unleashes cause Pokemon to Dynamax and rampage uncontrollably. It can also sometimes keep other Pokemon from Dynamaxing in its presence. Despite this connection to the phenomenon, it cannot Dynamax itself, as its Eternamax form replaces that effect.\n\nAs depicted in the JN episode ''Sword and Shield: \"From Here to Eternatus!\"'', Eternatus can use its energy core to target a Pokemon and force it to Dynamax or Gigantamax. The series also elaborates upon its ability to block other Pokemon from Dynamaxing, depicting this power as Eternatus absorbing the Galar particles in the area to make them unavailable for other Pokemon to use. The same episode also shows that Eternatus can forcibly revert other Pokemon that have already Dynamaxed or Gigantamaxed through the same process. In the animated series, Rose coined Eternatus's name, but in the past, it was known as the \"Darkest Day\", as referred to by the people of Galar who feared it 3000 years ago. As seen in chapter ''Oh My!! The Disappearance of Henry'' of the Pokemon Adventures manga, Eternatus's poison has the capability of altering people's behavior, making them violent and selfish, as shown with Henry after he touched the poison. As later mentioned by Calyrex in ''Munch Munch!! The Mysterious Carrot'', both met during the first Darkest Day.\n\nEternatus is an extraterrestrial Pokemon that came to the Pokemon world inside an asteroid around 20,000 years ago. It's implied by Peonia that Eternatus's asteroid (referred to as a massive Wishing Star) landed at the Crown Tundra, specifically in Slippery Slope, creating a cavern now known as the Max Lair.\n\nEternatus is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the moves Dynamax Cannon and Eternabeam.",

    "bio": "Necrozma is a vaguely humanoid Pokemon whose body appears to be constructed out of a black crystalline material. Necrozma's body is primarily prismatic and black due to the amount of impurities in its system. The large protrusion attached to its head is its tail, which has a row of three large spikes along the top and is white in the back with a dark gray symbol resembling a eight-pointed star in the center. Its face is actually a prism-like object known as the \"brain prism\", which possesses a collection of multicolored shapes that resemble eyes. While absorbing light, this brain prism glows white. Its thin arms have disproportionately large hands with three claws. Jutting out of the back of each hand is a whitish crystal that darkens toward the tip, and each elbow has a hook-like spike. Two large spikes jut from each shoulder and there is a row of smaller spikes along each side of its body. Its feet have three hook-like toes each.\n\nNecrozma originates from Ultra Space and is capable of opening and traveling through Ultra Wormholes. This causes many to believe Necrozma is one of the Ultra Beasts, however, different accounts refer to Necrozma as a \"reminiscent of the Ultra Beasts\" and \"a creature almost like an Ultra Beast\". It once had the ability to give light in its original form, but lost this ability along its true form after being heavily injured by the Ultra Recon Squad's ancestors in an attempt to steal its light; Professor Kukui and Lillie theorize that the Sparkling Stones and the Z-Crystals used to perform Z-Moves are fragments of Necrozma's body that it lost upon being injured and rained down into Alola. According to the Ultra Recon Squad, the light that radiates from Necrozma is the aura that surrounds the Trainer and Pokemon while performing a Z-Move and the aura surrounding a Totem Pokemon. This energy is consumed by Pokemon such as the Ultra Beasts and radiated by Pokemon such as Solgaleo and Lunala.\n\nNecrozma displays extremely violent behavior due to the constant, maddening pain it suffers in its incomplete state. Desperate for the light it requires to sustain itself and regain its original form, Necrozma absorbs light from other beings and places. This behavior caused it to be feared as and known as a \"pillager of light\" in ancient times. Necrozma has an eternal conflict that cycles with Solgaleo and Lunala for their limitless light energy.Necrozma usually absorbs the light energy from either Solgaleo or Lunala, or sometimes both, resulting in the respective Legendary Pokemon chasing after Necrozma to regain its light energy.\n\nIts black coloration is a result of impurities building up within it as a result of its deep slumber. Necrozma can shoot powerful lasers using the power of a prism. These lasers are powerful enough to blast through anything it hits. It can also attack its foes with a large pillar of light. Using its tail, it is able to propel itself by shooting black light from it. When Necrozma absorbs light from a world, that world becomes shrouded in darkness until the stolen light is returned as seen temporarily in Alola and in Ultra Megalopolis. In SM, the Aether Foundation confused Necrozma for an Ultra Beast and gave it a code name, \"UB: Black\". As seen in ''Filling the Light with Darkness'', Necrozma is capable of absorbing a world's Ultra Aura, which causes adults to become more tired and lose motivation. Necrozma loves Necrozma Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered and roared loudly to intimidate it in the past.\n\nNecrozma is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the moves Prismatic Laser and Photon Geyser. It is also the only known Pokemon that can have Prism Armor as an Ability.",

    "name": "Lunala",
    "ndex": "0792",
    "category": "Moone",
    "bio": "Lunala is a large Pokemon resembling a skeletal, legless bat. It has a short snout, dark pink eyes with white centers, and a deep blue area on its upper head that shows a constantly changing starscape. A rigid raised hood wraps around its head in a crescent shape and drapes around its neck as well. The outside of the hood is yellow, while the inner part that curves around Lunala's head is white with deep blue streaks. Its torso resembles a ribcage with a slightly curved spike on each shoulder and three spikes extending from the bottom toward its tail. Its massive wings resemble a bat's wings with the skeleton exposed, except that Lunala's wings have a total of seven \"finger bones\": four running through each wing, one running along the edge to the outermost tip, and two pointing upwards that may act as claws that are more functional. The four \"bones\" in Lunala's wings are only visible in segments. The skin of Lunala's wings is an iridescent deep blue and a light blue light source appears to glow from behind its ribcage. A large, pale yellow crescent connects the outermost tip of each wing to the next two inner tips, and the remaining two innermost tips are adorned by yellow, four-pointed stars. The bottom of Lunala's tail is also lined by a yellow crescent with a ridge running up the middle of the tail towards the rib cage.\n\nWhen Lunala enters its Full Moon phase, its third eye\u2014a light red symbol of an eye\u2014appears on its forehead, and the starscape turns to streaks of light. The skin of its wings glows a bright, light blue. It spreads its wings wide so that the golden parts on each wing are arranged in a circle. It enters this phase while using its signature move or traveling through Ultra Space.\n\nLunala has long been honored as an emissary of the moon; in ancient times, it was known as \"the beast that calls the moon\". This Pokemon constantly absorbs light to convert it into energy and can obscure daylight with darkness. When it spreads its wings to absorb light and glitter, it resembles a beautiful night sky. It is said to live in another world, which it returns to when it opens its third eye. Lunala can create Ultra Wormholes to travel to and from Ultra Space. It can emit a sinister ray to attack its target. Alongside its counterpart, Solgaleo, it can create Cosmog, which it is said to be the female Evolution of. Lunala and Solgaleo also have the power to create Z-Crystals and even restore Necrozma's light, allowing it to return to its true, Ultra form. It can also influence a Rockruff's Evolution into Lycanroc's Midnight form with lunar energy. Ultra Recon Squad use Lunala as their own Ride Pokemon to travel through Ultra Space.\n\nLunala, similar to Solgaleo, is a being composed of light; due to that, it is constantly hunted down by Necrozma through Ultra Space, so it can try and devour Lunala's light to ease its nonstopping pain and regain its original, form. Lunala is in an eternal conflict with Necrozma, which seeks to steal its boundless energy. Solgaleo, along with Lunala, pursues Necrozma to reclaim the stolen energy of light in an unending cycle.  When Necrozma takes control of Lunala, Necrozma's body divides into pieces that connect to Lunala's body like an armor, possessing it and transforming itself into Dawn Wings Necrozma, as its pieces constantly absorb Lunala's light. However, Lunala can coexist with Necrozma willingly, regardless of fusion. Lunala loves Lunala Treats made by Snacksworth, who once encountered it in the past.\n\nLunala and Dawn Wings Necrozma are the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Moongeist Beam. They are also the only known Pokemon capable of using the Z-Move Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom. Additionally, Lunala is the only known Pokemon that can have Shadow Shield as an Ability.\n",

    "name": "Shellder",
    "ndex": "0090",
    "category": "Bivalve",
    "bio": "Shellder is a bivalve mollusk Pokemon encased within a spiky, blue-violet bivalve shell. It has two round white eyes with tiny black pupils. Its long, red tongue, usually hidden due to the darkness of Shellder\u2019s body, extends from its often closed mouth. Shellder uses this tongue to burrow into the sand to sleep overnight and to lure and capture prey. If it were to close its shell, nothing could come to it; however, the tongue protrudes even when its shell is shut. Tugging on it will cause the shell to pop open. Its soft and tender body is well-protected by its extremely durable shell, which is purported to be harder than diamonds and has historically been used by people to make shields. It can make pearls from accumulated sand, though it discards them as they are typically in its way. \n\nShellder has an unusually strong appetite for the tail of a Slowpoke and can develop a symbiotic relationship with the Dopey Pokemon. After attaching itself to the Slowpoke's tail, the two undergo a metamorphosis and evolve into Slowbro together. Alternatively, if it attaches to the head of a Slowpoke in possession of a King's Rock, the two will instead evolve into Slowking. These relationships allow it to travel onto land and begin a new stage in its life cycle. In Galar, Shellder attaches to the forearms and heads of Galarian Slowpoke wearing Galarica Cuffs or Galarica Wreaths, causing the Evolution into Galarian Slowbro and Galarian Slowking, respectively. Shellder that are part of Slowbro change in shape further if it Mega Evolves.\n\nRegardless of which form the two Pokemon evolve into, Shellder's shell changes to a light gray color with irregular darker spots. Its shape changes into a spiny, spiraled cone with several tiers, which is slightly rounded for Galarian Slowbro. Sharp teeth develop around the rim of the shell to anchor it securely to the evolved Slowpoke, and its eyes now peek out from the bottom rim of the shell. In its crown form, Shellder has a large horn on either side of its shell, which is purple for Galarian Slowking. It also gains a gem: a red one on the underside for Johtonian Slowking, and a green one between its eyes for the Galarian form. As part of Mega Slowbro, it becomes large enough to contain most of the Slowpoke's body, gaining two holes near the rim and an opening at the tip, through which protrude the Slowpoke's forelegs and tail respectively. \n\nWhile in its crown form, Shellder will periodically release its venom into Slowking's brain. This is actually beneficial to Slowking, as it causes the Regal Pokemon's intelligence to increase. Higher quantities of venom intensify this effect, and Shellder is easily provoked into releasing more whenever Slowking yawns. However, Shellder's poison makes Slowbro more sluggish as it continues to drain nutrients from its host's body. As seen in ''Slowking's Crowning!'' and ''An Evolution in Taste!'', the crown form of Shellder can take control of humans who wear it and speak through its host. The control of Shellder wears off the moment the crown is removed.\n\nDespite its hard shell, clamping on to an opponent will reveal its vulnerable parts. Because of this, it will only clamp itself to a foe as a last resort. It swims around its seafloor home by rapidly opening and closing its shell while facing backward. Despite its appearance, Shellder is surprisingly fast. Prehistoric Shellder were apparently preyed upon by Omastar, whose powerful bites were capable of breaking through its shell. Shellder and its evolved form, Cloyster, are related to Shellos and Gastrodon. Kingler, Rufflet, and Bruxish are modern predators of Shellder.\n\nPrior to Generation III, Clamp was its signature move. Prior to Generation V, Icicle Spear was also its signature move, but other Pokemon could still inherit it via breeding. Additionally, prior to Generation V, Shellder and its evolved form, Cloyster, were the only known Pokemon that could have Skill Link as an Ability.\n",

    "name": "Kommo-o",
    "ndex": "0784",
    "category": "Scaly",
    "bio": "Kommo-o is a bipedal, reptilian Pokemon covered in scaly armor as hard as steel. Its scales were historically processed into armor, weapons, and additional commodities used by humans. Most of its body is gray with some lighter gray areas as well as yellow and red markings. It has a rounded, beak-ish snout and small eyes nearly hidden under its head armor. On the tip of its snout is a patch of pale gray and both the upper and lower jaws have a small, tooth-like spike on each side. The top of its head is covered by an elaborate arrangement of scales. At the front of the headdress is an oval scale, which is yellow with a red heart-shape at the base. On either side of the front scale is a chain of four circular scales; the first three scales are red with yellow trim and the last scale is solid yellow. Three additional chains of plain yellow scales extend from the back of the headdress. Running down the front of its long neck is a line of overlapping scales: one solid gray at the top, three larger gray ones with yellow rims, and one solid yellow scale at the bottom. A thick yellow stripe with a rounded projection in the center runs across its chest. Covering its shoulders are tufts of spiky, white feathers with small, gray scales overlapping them. Four overlapping scales cover the tops of its arms: three are gray with yellow edges and the scales that cover its hands are red with yellow edges.\n\nKommo-o has four scaly chains, all of which consist of four scales, extending from just behind its shoulders. The two foremost chains are made of overlapping scales and have a solid gray scale at the top followed by three scales with yellow edges. The other two chains consist of only solid gray scales and do not appear to overlap. The lower halves of its legs are dark gray and there is a pale gray marking across each knee. Its hands have four yellow claws, while the feet have only three. A long line of slightly raised, pale gray scales runs down the center of its back to about halfway up its tapering tail. Near the tip of its tail are three sets of loose scales that increase in size near the tip. Each set is made up of four separate scales that encircle the tail; the two lower sets are solid yellow, while the set nearest the tip have gray centers. The very tip of its tail is pale gray.\n\nKommo-o, having completed its harsh training, returns to its birthplace to protect Jangmo-o. However, it only watches over them from a distance. The power of Kommo-o's uppercut is enough to send foes flying, so simply raising its arms can generate enough force to change its surroundings. According to legend, Kommo-o's glittering scales are meant to drive away a great darkness. The reason it seeks strong opponents is also said to be a quest for power to defeat the darkness. Kommo-o's scales can be used to generate offensive sound waves, in addition to serving as a coat of natural armor.\n\nBecause it does not wish to fight weak foes, it clangs its scales together when it senses someone approaching. This is intended to frighten off weak or cowardly opponents. Kommo-o also swings the scales on its tail to threaten any enemies it sees. Upon finishing off its prey, Kommo-o will let out a victory howl. Additionally, the metallic sounds made by its comrades celebrating can also be heard all around the area the group is in.\n\nWhile the animated series shows that Kommo-o is capable of bipedal locomotion, the core series games since Generation VIII show that it vastly prefers to walk and run around by knuckle-walking.\n\nA special Kommo-o in Alola acts as the Totem Pokemon for an unmanned trial in Vast Poni Canyon. This Kommo-o possesses Z-Power, an energy that originates from Ultra Wormholes and takes the form of a golden, flaring aura. The reward for defeating Totem Kommo-o and completing the trial is a Dragonium Z.\n\nKommo-o is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the moves Clanging Scales and Clangorous Soul. Kommo-o is also the only known Pokemon capable of using the Z-Move Clangorous Soulblaze.",

    "name": "Terapagos",
    "ndex": "1024",
    "category": "Tera",
    "bio": "Normal Form Terapagos is a small reptilian Pokemon that resembles an indigo tortoise. Its head, legs, and tail stem from a cyan, hexagonal shell with the Terastal symbol on its back: a white hexagon with triangular extensions on each corner that connects it to the edges of its back. Its neck and legs each have a cyan four-pointed star and ring rub on them. Its feet each have three toes, and its tail has a cyan four-pointed star at its tip. It has two light blue eyes with rouge rimming and four-pointed star-shaped pupils. It has a diamond-like pattern on its forehead and two diamonds hanging like earrings on both sides of its head. Lastly, it has a \"ponytail\" made up of three segments of diamond-like shapes. The segments reduce in size as they get farther from the head and gain a purplish tint to them.\n\nNormal Form Terapagos is said to have a splendid aura. It is a small and particularly weak Pokemon; for that reason, it can assume a dormant state whenever its life is put in danger or it needs to hibernate, pulling its head, limbs, and tail into its shell and shrinking in size, which makes itself look like an ordinary jewel. It also has the ability to crystallize the energy in its own body to form a green, protective barrier around itself if necessary, even in its dormant state. Through this same ability, Terapagos causes glowing, hard crystals to form around it, even in its dormant state, which gave Area Zero its distinctive appearance. As depicted in HZ, like other turtles, Terapagos is unable to move if it is turned upside down, needing outside help to stand back up. It has shown to have an incredibly long lifespan, with one known to have lived for millions of years while slumbering within its shell.\n\nTerapagos is responsible for the Terastal phenomenon. Terapagos inhabited the Paldea region in a bygone era. It was thought that this species went extinct, with it said to have been caught up in seismic shifts that occurred about 2,000,000 years ago. However, one of them managed to survive by crystallizing its own body and going into hibernation in the Area Zero Underdepths, where it laid low until the present day. According to Briar, Terapagos is made of Terastal energy. Heath is the one who discovered Terapagos and coined its name. With the power of its crystals, Terapagos can bombard its foes with star-shaped projectiles. After ''The Approaching Shadow!'', Spinel comes to the conclusion that Terapagos and Laquium are opposite forces. In ''Beyond the Shining Rainbow'', it was shown absorbing the energy of the crystals in Area Zero to power up. In ''Guided by the Black Rayquaza!'', it was also shown gathering its allies' power into itself to power up as well. As shown in HZ092, Sableye, who feed on gemstones and crystals, seem to be interested in Terapagos's crystalline body.\n\nTerapagos also has the ability to alter timelines in some capacity, as seen in the core series games and animated series. An example if this is it being capable of using crystals such as the ones from the Crystal Pool to bring humans and objects forward from other points in time as seen with Professor SadaS/Professor TuroV who hasn't finished their time machine and Rystal who had lived 100 years in the past. While using this ability, a mist appears around the affected area; once it disappears, whatever was brought is sent back. As seen in several ''Pokemon Horizons'' episodes, Terapagos also has the ability to create visions of its own memories and even of other people's. Due to the Terastal energy its body produces, Terapagos was responsible for allowing advanced technologies, such as Tera Orbs, the professor's AI duplicate, and a time machine that summons Pokemon from different points in the timeline or even from other timelines, to exist in spite of human limitations. Tera Orbs directly exposed to the energy from Terapagos will gain the ability to Terastallize Pokemon without the need to recharge. Terapagos also has a strong connection to the Stellar type.\n\nTerapagos is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Tera Starstorm. Its Normal Form is also the only known Pokemon that can have Tera Shift as its Ability.",

    "ndex": "0745",
    "category": "Wolf",
    "bio": "Lycanroc is a canine Pokemon resembling a wolf. It has three possible forms: Midday Form, Midnight Form, and Dusk Form. The first two forms are influenced by Solgaleo and Lunala when bathed in solar or lunar energy. The third form is said to have been influenced by the setting sun of the evening. Lycanroc are used by humans as guards, to protect their fields from prey Deerling.\n;Midday Form\nIn its Midday Form, Lycanroc resembles a quadrupedal, light brown wolf. It has a white underbelly that extends up around its muzzle and eyes in a mask-like marking. It has pointed ears with dark brown tips and pink insides, big blue eyes, and a triangular, dark brown nose. There are four sharp fangs in its mouth: two in the upper jaw and two in the lower. Large tufts of brown fur extend from the sides of its head; three tufts on each side. A bushy, white mane covers its neck. Four dark brown rocks poke out of its mane, creating a shape similar to a stylized sun. The rocks are said to be razor-sharp. The lower portions of this form's legs are white, and each foot has three dark brown claws. It also has a long, fluffy white tail.\n\nThe Midday Form has a calm, collected, and cautious personality. In order to avoid needless fighting, the Midday Form prefers to live alone and does not form a pack with others of its kind. However, it is a fiercely loyal partner to Trainers that accept it during its unruly stage. In battle, it darts past opponents while attacking them with the rocks in its mane. These swift movements leave many foes bewildered and backed into a corner. It always aims for the foes' weak spot using its fangs. Broken fragments of its stone mane are considered good luck.\n\n;Midnight Form\nIn its Midnight Form, Lycanroc instead resembles a slouched, bipedal wolf or werewolf. It has short red fur with white on its lower legs and a white streak that covers its face, underbelly, and tail. It has pointed, button ears with black tips, three large tufts of fur on each side of its face, a triangular black nose, and a mouth full of sharp teeth. While the sclerae, irises, and pupils of its eye are visible, they all glow a pinkish red and no distinctive colors are visible. A mane of fur covers its back and shoulders, sweeping forward over its head to form a crescent moon shape. On either side of its body, just below the shoulders, two small rocks resembling claws poke out of the mane. A single, bigger stone projects out of the front of the mane over its head. Each of this form's paws has three black claws, and it has a stubby tail covered in long fur.\n\nIn contrast to its Midday Form, Lycanroc's Midnight Form is thrilled by battling and becomes more excited the stronger its opponent. This excitement is what causes its eyes to glow. The Midnight Form is known to be reckless along with extremely vicious temper. Its strategy consists of closing in on its opponent and encouraging attack, then countering with a powerful blow that knocks out its opponent. The full force of its headbutts can destroy giant boulders. Trainers that can draw out its power earn its trust, but it despises those that it disagrees with or who try to force it to fight.\n\n;Dusk Form\nIn its Dusk Form, Lycanroc resembles a combination of its Midday and Midnight Forms. Its body is similar to Midday Form with the same white color except with orange-gold fur. It retains the three brown claws for all four feet. The white fluffy mane resembles a sun with part of the crescent moon. It also has four rocks around its neck like a sun as well along with a single, bigger stone coming from the mane over its head. Its face resembles Midday Form Lycanroc's but is orange-gold with bright green eyes,  which can change to bright glowing red when angry or attacking.\n\nThe Dusk Form Lycanroc shares traits from the previous two forms. Its stance, calm demeanor, and loyal nature are shared with the Midday Form. However, it also shares the Midnight Form's fighting spirit, including the red, glowing eyes at the moment of attack. Dusk Form Lycanroc never barks, unlike its two other forms. Upon entering battle, Lycanroc will relentlessly drive its opponents into a corner. Due to only evolving at sunset, the Dusk Form is considered the rarest of the three forms. The Dusk Form of Lycanroc is rather difficult to train due to its temperamental nature. Because of this, Dusk Form Lycanroc is considered the most troublesome of its three forms.\n\n;Signature moves\nLycanroc is the only known Pokemon capable of using the Z-Move Splintered Stormshards. \n\nLycanroc's Midday and Dusk Forms are the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Accelerock.\n",

    "name": "Nihilego",
    "ndex": "0793",
    "category": "Parasite",
    "bio": "Nihilego is an Ultra Beast that resembles a jellyfish. The bell is semi-translucent and encircled with several white, star-shaped markings. The wavy rim of the bell flares outward and is bright blue. Its tentacles appear gelatinous and give it a vaguely humanoid shape. Several tentacles mesh together forming the appearance of a cape or long hair, while four shorter tentacles resemble shorter hair and arms. Two long tentacles make up the legs of the human shape. According to its concept art, Nihilego's body is made of various types of glass.\n\nNihilego was one of the first Ultra Beast discovered by Professor Mohn for the Aether Foundation. <!--He was also the one who coined Nihilego's name.fact-->Nihilego live in another world named Ultra Deep Sea, occasionally being brought to Alola through Ultra Wormholes. Although its exact levels of intelligence are unknown, it is believed to act upon a self-preservation instinct, and displays a lack of emotion or even will. However, in addition to its constantly changing human-like shape, it is sometimes seen acting like a young girl. According to Wicke from the Aether Foundation, Nihilego's most distinctive feature is its parasitic capability. When Nihilego latches on to a host's head, it does not manipulate its actions directly. Instead it awakens the host's own capabilities and boosts them to an extreme extent in order to protect itself. It injects the host with a sort of neurotoxin to achieve this effect. This neurotoxin of Nihilego's is incredibly stimulating and inspires feelings of extreme excitement and a lack of inhibition in its host. Anything or anyone that Nihilego latches on to will have its native skills forcibly activated to their fullest extent and will then act as it naturally desires to. Pokemon Adventures also elaborates upon Nihilego's neurotoxin, explaining that its venom turns their negative emotions into happiness and pleasure. It's also said that Nihilego mostly feed on those who feel intense worry or anxiety.\n\nWicke also claims that like all Ultra Beasts, Nihilego stores Z-Power, the same energy possessed by Totem Pokemon, within its body, which takes the form of a red, flaring aura. As seen in the games, Nihilego are capable of creating illusions, such as making itself and its allies vanish. In ''The Homecoming Crown!'', a Nihilego was shown using its powers to see the memories of people and even alter their perception. That same episode also showed that Nihilego can demonstrate emotions other than self-preservation and the ability to heal people.\n\n\n;Fusion\n\nNihilego is capable of physically merging with its host, such as with Lusamine in various media. In this \"merged\" state, the Nihilego's bell loses its stars, developing several iridescent spots across its surface. Its eight tentacles become long and flattened and have numerous deep black spots with various colored diamond-shapes inside. Four of the tentacles are connected to the bell via frilly white structures; these tentacles have four spines protruding from them that can be used similarly to hands. The remaining four tentacles each terminate in a single larger spine. Lusamine's body also changes and is visible within Nihilego's bell as her legs dangle beneath it. Her hair turns black with golden lines, her eyes turn yellow, half of her legs and dress become black as the other half becomes purple.\n\nThe toxins produced by Nihilego may remain in the host's body, even after Nihilego has left their body. This can leave the former host to remain ill for unspecified amounts of time and treatment may be necessary. Nihilego leaving a host's body can also cause unconsciousness, as is the case with Lusamine, however it unknown whether or not this is because of Nihilego's toxins, the stress of fusion or the overwhelming amount of Z-Power within her body. This form of Nihilego is unobtainable, and is only seen with Lusamine as a Trainer. Intenerally, this form is described as '''MOTHERBEAST''', using a combination of the codenames for Lusamine (MOTHER) and the Ultra Beasts (BEAST). The Alola Region Artworks displays the fusion as '''\u30eb\u30b6\u30df\u30fc\u30cd (\u30a6\u30c4\u30ed\u30a4\u30c9)''', organizing it as a Trainer. During battle, Nihilego can control its host's Pokemon, and even empower them with its own Z-Power aura.fact\n\nIn Pokemon the Series, as depicted in ''10,000,000 Reasons to Fight!'', Nihilego can lower it tentacles to inject its toxins into the ground while sharp rocks grow below. While the same episode shows that Nihilego can willingly end this merger and it may be disrupted in other ways as well, the lingering toxins and the shock of the separation can leave the host in critical condition, both physically and psychologically. The episode also shows that Nihilego can take full control of its host and form an orb with its own mass to prevent them from escaping the fusion. Nihilego is shown to play on Lusamine's desires and reduced her mentality to that of a child's. \n-\n\n\n",

    "name": "Koraidon",
    "ndex": "1007",
    "category": "Paradox",
    "bio": "==Biology== \nKoraidon is a large, reptilian Pokemon primarily covered in scarlet feathers with white accents on its cheeks, upper body, thighs, and tail. Its most notable feature is a tire-like gular sac on its throat, which inflates and deflates depending on its form. Koraidon's head has a crest of feathers and a pair of long, twisted, brow-plume-like tendrils. Additional feathers at the base of its tail transition from blue to purple and end in white tips, creating a striking appearance. Its eyes have yellow sclerae, orange irises, and brown pupils, with red plumes giving the impression of eyebrows. Koraidon's body is adorned with blue markings on its elbows and shoulders, as well as blue frills down its neck. From each shoulder, a curved, handlebar-like structure extends backward. It has webbed feet, each with four claws; the two central claws are sometimes held close together, making it appear as though there are only three. The gular sac and base of its tail share a grooved texture, but the sac is also lined with spikes.\n\nAware of its formidable strength, Koraidon exudes confidence and rarely feels threatened. Though cautious around humans, its curiosity sometimes leads it to play with them. Its power surges under harsh sunlight due to an ancient energy coursing through its body. In battle, Koraidon will unfurl its wings and crash into its targets with explosive force. While Koraidon bears a resemblance to modern-day Cyclizar, it is known to be far more ferocious and muscular. \n\nThe origins of Koraidon in the present day trace back to a time machine constructed by Professor Sada, which brought two specimens to Area Zero a decade ago. These two individuals displayed contrasting temperaments: one was friendly and curious, while the other was aggressive and territorial. 200 years prior to the events of Scarlet and Violet, Heath also encountered a Koraidon, as seen in the Scarlet Book, though it is unclear how it arrived in Area Zero at the time. According to AI Sada, it is an ancient Pokemon related to Cyclizar. However, a version of Professor Sada that appeared at the Crystal Pool suggests that Koraidon is a counterpart to Cyclizar from an alternate timeline.  It was formerly referred to as the \"Winged King\" in the Scarlet Book, with its current name coined by Professor Sada, potentially as a result of a bootstrap paradox.\n\nKoraidon has five different transformations it can change between as it traverses varying terrain and adapts to different situations. In its \"Apex Build\", Koraidon shifts to a bipedal stance and adopts a poised, battle-ready posture. The feathers on its head and rear unfold and stand upright, forming a crest that resembles a war bonnet. The gular sac on its throat inflates, displaying a red, gear-like pattern, while the base of its tail becomes more robust. Koraidon's claws spread apart, revealing the white membranes between its toes. During battle, Koraidon leverages its immense strength and array of natural weapons to overpower opponents, including powerful jaws, sharp claws, and a sturdy tail. Its legs possess extraordinary strength, allowing it to leap over 65 feet into the air and use the momentum from its falls for devastating kicks and body slams. It is said to have the power to shatter the ground with its fists alone. According to Arven, this is Koraidon's true form. In its \"Limited Build\", Koraidon reverts to a quadrupedal stance. The feathers on its head and rear are folded and closed, and the gular sac retracts, exposing a tire-like protrusion. The webbing between its claws is not visible, as its central claws stay close together. Koraidon typically takes on this form when weakened or not engaged in battle. In all travel forms, Koraidon's tail stays tucked in, displaying a pattern similar to that found on its gular sac. In its \"Sprinting Build\", Koraidon tucks its tail and runs on all fours, allowing it to reach high speeds and climb steep cliffs. In its \"Swimming Build\", the gular sac inflates, enabling Koraidon to float on water. It propels itself by paddling with its webbed feet. In its \"Gliding Build\", the tendrils on Koraidon's head unfurl into wings, allowing it to glide or even fly through the sky.\n\nKoraidon is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Collision Course. It is also the only known Pokemon that can have Orichalcum Pulse as an Ability.\n\n",

    "name": "Arceus",
    "ndex": "0493",
    "category": "Alpha",
    "bio": "In its Normal form, Arceus is a white, equine Pokemon with an androgynous appearance. It resembles a qilin or centaur with a gray, vertically striated underside. The striated pattern also appears on the underside of its mane, tail, and face. Its four pointed feet are tipped with gold hooves. Its long mane juts away from its head, and its face is gray, with green eyes, red pupils, and a green circular pattern below its eyes. Arceus also has a streak of gold coloration on its head, which points upward. Its neck is fairly long, with two pairs of extrusions to the sides, and a flap-like feature on the neck's underside that is colored white like much of the body. Arceus also has a golden cross-like wheel attached to its body by its round abdomen. The wheel also has four green jewels attached to it. The pattern of striated gray of Arceus's underbelly continues past its waist. Its limbs have gray undersides and extrusions at the tops of the legs. Arceus's tail is similar to its mane in terms of shape and coloration. Despite its quadruped appearance, Arceus is capable of flight.\n\nAccording to legend, it shaped the Pokemon universe using its 1,000 arms. Arceus has been referred to as the \"Original One\" in myths and legends and is generally considered one of the strongest Pokemon. Arceus is believed to be the creator of the Sinnoh and Ransei regions, the Pokemon world, and possibly, even the entire Pokemon universe. It also created eggs which the Pokemon of myth, Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina, hatched from, as well as another egg which the lake guardians, Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit, hatched from. It could also recreate these eggs if it wanted to. Because of this, Arceus is thought to be one of the longest-lived Pokemon species, if not the oldest Pokemon in existence. In ''Arceus and the Jewel of Life'', Arceus is portrayed as having powers such as bringing back things that it once destroyed, making certain things vanish into thin air, halting time, and overturning the very laws of nature. In the same movie, it is said to \"feed\" off the energy of its Plates. \nArceus does not suffer fools gladly and will attack in a violent rampage if betrayed or deceived. It also holds long grudges if betrayed by those it considered friends. In ''Hoopa and the Clash of Ages'', it was shown to be able to stop the destruction caused by a space-time void. As shown in the JN episode ''Showdown at the Gates of Warp!'', Arceus has the power to not only calm Dialga and Palkia, but also destroy the Red Chain controlling them. It can release countless shots of light that disintegrate the landscape around it. Arceus can change its type at will to adapt to a situation through the use of its Plates or type-specific Z-Crystals. Arceus also has the power to split in two, creating a piece of itself to exist outside of its realm, which is implied to be its physical form\u2014only a piece of its whole being\u2014while its true form is unknown and incomprehensible.\n\nArceus was known to care for and safeguard the planet in ancient times, protecting the world from cataclysms such as meteors, and it would show gratitude and compassion to those who treated it with kindness. In modern times, Arceus continues to watch over the world and wishes for people and Pokemon to work together in the face of adversity. Even when it is needed, it only gives hints on how to solve problems instead of directly interfering. Arceus can also give its blessing to other Pokemon through bolts of light, making them bigger and more powerful, as seen with the ancient hero's 10 Pokemon companions. This blessing is passed down through family lines, as seen with the descendants of the hero's Pokemon: the noble Pokemon and ride Pokemon worshiped by the people of Hisui. \n\nIn Legends: Arceus, Arceus transformed a normal cellphone into an Arc Phone, a device that allows humans to communicate with it through text messages. Arceus also has the power to appear in dreams and create a variety of Pokemon to serve as challenges, as seen in Eternal Battle Reverie. In Masters EX, through the sync stones ultimate, Arceus can give its blessing to a Trainer it deems worthy, transforming their outfits into costumes known as arc suits. As a result, their sync pair is blessed as well, granting them a divine move over their normal sync move. In ''Arceus and the Jewel of Life'', using its Earth, Splash, Meadow, Zap, and Draco Plates, Arceus created the Jewel of Life, a powerful artifact capable of turning a desolate land into a rich and fertile one. \n\nLike the Pokemon it created, Arceus also resides in another dimension, a realm beyond time and space itself. There, it appears in a form made of golden light, shaped like the silhouette of its normal appearance. This could possibly be its true form. It was also shown to be capable of human speech, stating that \"Arceus\" is simply the name humans call it. The ancient Sinnoh people worshiped it, referring to it as \"almighty Sinnoh,\" \"great Sinnoh,\" and \"might of Sinnoh,\" with the term \"Sinnoh\" later on becoming the name of the region. The Diamond Clan and Pearl Clan also worshipped it, though they mistook Dialga and Palkia respectively for Arceus. In ancient myths, it is said that the Origin Ore, an ore of mysterious power, contains the power of Arceus itself. \n\nIn Alola, the Aether Foundation used Arceus's data, collected from myths and legends from Canalave City's library, during the Beast killer project to create the artificial Pokemon Type: Full. Equipped with the RKS System, an Ability similar to Arceus's Multitype, it was developed to protect Alola from Ultra Beasts. However, the project was deemed a failure and was later abandoned, and Type: Full's ability was sealed with a control helmet, which caused it to devolve and be renamed Type: Null. \n\nArceus is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Judgment. It is also able to use charged-up versions of the Pokemon of myth's signature moves (Roar of Time, Spacial Rend and Shadow Force), as seen in its boss battle in Pokemon Legends: Arceus. Additionally, Arceus is the only known Pokemon that can have Multitype as an Ability.",

    "name": "Miraidon",
    "ndex": "1008",
    "category": "Paradox",
    "bio": "Miraidon is a large, robotic, reptilian Pokemon with a primarily metallic, violet body. Its face, neck, abdomen, tail, and knee joints are silver, while its claws are white. A distinctive feature of Miraidon is the gular sac on its throat, which changes appearance across its various forms. Its head features a small, dark purple casque reminiscent of a motorcycle windshield and circular, purple cheek markings. Miraidon's eyes resemble an LED display, with black sclerae and pupils and pixelated irises that can change pattern to simulate blinking. Each eye is bordered by two connected silver plates that resemble eyelids, from which long blue and yellow plasma-like antennae extend, resembling eyebrows. Miraidon's shoulders are equipped with backward-curving, handlebar-like structures. A black, fender-like structure is positioned on its lower back just above the base of its tail. Each of Miraidon's feet has three claws, with the central one marked by a vertical black line. Both its tail and gular sac have grooved surfaces, resembling tire treads. In the Pokemon Adventures manga, Miraidon is shown to possess a robotic tongue that visually resembles its gular sac.\n\nDespite its mechanical appearance, Miraidon displays behavior that suggests an advanced level of intelligence and perceptiveness. It carefully evaluates a person's character using keen insight before deciding to accompany them. Miraidon's calm and enigmatic nature makes it difficult to discern its thoughts or emotions, with subtle hints only visible in its eyes. Miraidon also exhibits biological traits such as the ability to consume food, specifically Herba Mystica sandwiches, to regain strength and power, allowing it to access its transformations after being weakened. Due to the smell of Herba Mystica smell on them, Miraidon can track down Titan Pokemon.\n\nMiraidon can achieve high speeds and unleash powerful, electrically charged attacks, utilizing the advanced engine within its body to amplify its abilities, especially when surrounded by Electric Terrain. In battle, Miraidon can also race at ultrafast speeds to pierce its targets with futuristic electricity. It shares similarities with Cyclizar, a contemporary Pokemon, though Miraidon is notably more powerful and aggressive.\n\nThe origins of Miraidon in the present day trace back to a time machine constructed by Professor Turo, which brought two specimens to Area Zero a decade ago. These two individuals displayed contrasting temperaments: one was friendly and curious, while the other was aggressive and territorial. 200 years ago, Heath also encountered a Miraidon as seen in the Violet Book, though it is unclear how it arrived in Area Zero at the time. According to AI Turo, it is a futuristic relative of Cyclizar, though a version of Turo that appeared at the Crystal Pool suggests it may come from an alternate timeline. It was formerly referred to as the \"Iron Serpent\" in the Violet Book, with its current name, Miraidon, attributed to Professor Turo, potentially due to a bootstrap paradox.\nMiraidon has five different transformations it can change between as it traverses varying terrain and adapts to different situations. In \"Ultimate Mode\", Miraidon's body becomes charged with purplish-yellow energy. Its gular sac inflates and glows with a bluish-white light, while its antennae flare with electricity, taking on the appearance of lightning bolts. The middle and tip of its tail also emit this energy. Miraidon's back legs fold into its thighs, forming jet engine-like structures that enable it to hover and fly. Its legs also double as electrical cannons in this form. Its irises display a unique combination of light blue outer rings and yellow inner rings. Areas on its cheeks, arms, handlebars, and thighs are filled with light purple energy. When Miraidon enters sleep, it deactivates, causing its glowing features to turn silver. In battle, Miraidon floats to maintain a strategic position, applying pressure to grounded foes while predicting their movements and striking at their weak points. It uses electricity generated within its body to charge its claws, fangs, and tail, with one strike from its charged tail said to knock out even the most resilient opponents. Miraidon can unleash lightning from its mouth, neck, or hind legs, powerful enough to scorch the land. According to Arven, this is considered Miraidon's true form. In \"Low-Power Mode\", Miraidon adopts a quadrupedal stance. It lacks the intense purplish-yellow energy seen in Ultimate Mode, resulting in a monochromatic silver appearance on its gular sac, antennae, and tail similar to when entering sleep in that transformation. Its irises remain light blue, and areas on its cheeks, antennae, handlebars, and thighs retain subtle light purple energy. Miraidon assumes this form when weakened or not engaged in battle. In all travel forms, Miraidon's tail stays tucked in, and its back legs remain folded, exposing its jet engines for propulsion. In \"Drive Mode\", energy is channeled to its tail and throat, creating wheel-like rings that enable high-speed movement and cliff climbing. In \"Aquatic Mode\", the rings expand to help Miraidon float and propel itself in water, using either the rotation of the rings or its jet engines. In \"Glide Mode\", its antennae extend to spread an energy membrane, allowing it to glide or fly through the air.\n\nMiraidon is the only known Pokemon capable of learning the move Electro Drift. It is also the only known Pokemon that can have Hadron Engine as an Ability.\n\n",
